The invariants `0 <= i <= n`, `a + b = 3 * (i + unknown())`, and `a = i + unknown() - b` hold true before the loop, and since the loop condition depends only on `i` and `n`, they will continue to hold true in every iteration of the loop. The invariants `0 <= a <= 2*n` and `0 <= b <= 2*n` hold true based on the updates to `a` and `b` in the loop.\n- After the loop termination, `i` is equal to `n`, and the loop condition no longer holds. Thus, the invariants `0 <= i <= n`, `a + b = 3 * (i + unknown())`, and `a = i + unknown() - b` hold true. Since the loop has terminated, the updates to `a` and `b` will not affect their bounds anymore. Therefore, the invariants `0 <= a <= 2*n` and `0 <= b <= 2*n` also hold true. \n\nTherefore, the loop invariants presented above are sufficient to verify the post-condition of the program."

It is also true after each iteration because if `i` is even, then `a` is incremented by `1` and `b` is incremented by `2`, so `a` becomes `i/2 + 1 + b` which is equal to `i/2 + b + 1`, and if `i` is odd, then `a` is incremented by `2` and `b` is incremented by `1`, so `a` becomes `(i+1)/2 + b` which is equal to `i/2 + b + 1`.\n- `(i % 2 == 1) ==> (b = i/2 + a)` is true before entering the loop because the implication trivially holds when `i` is initially `0`. It is also true after each iteration because if `i` is odd, then `a` is incremented by `2` and `b` is incremented by `1`, so `b` becomes `i/2 + 1 + a` which is equal to `i/2 + a + 1`, and if `i` is even, then `a` is incremented by `1` and `b` is incremented by `2`, so `b` becomes `(i+1)/2 + a` which is equal to `i/2 + a + 1`.\n\nThe loop invariants together imply the post-condition `a + b = 3*n`.",
