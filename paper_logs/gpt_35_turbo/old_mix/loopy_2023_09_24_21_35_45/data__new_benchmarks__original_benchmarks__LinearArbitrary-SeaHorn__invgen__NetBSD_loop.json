The first assertion states that `glob2_p_off` is non-negative, and the second assertion states that `glob2_p_off` is less than `MAXPATHLEN + 1`.\n\nNow, let's find the necessary loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= glob2_p_off <= glob2_pathlim_off;\n    loop invariant 0 <= glob2_pathbuf_off <= bound_off <= MAXPATHLEN;\n    loop invariant glob2_p_off < MAXPATHLEN + 1;\n*/\n```\nThe first loop invariant states that `glob2_p_off` is always within the bounds of `glob2_pathbuf_off` and `glob2_pathlim_off`.\n\nThe second loop invariant states that `glob2_pathbuf_off`, `bound_off`, and `glob2_pathlim_off` are all within the bounds of `0` and `MAXPATHLEN`.\n\nThe third loop invariant is the same as the second assertion in the loop body, namely that `glob2_p_off` is less than `MAXPATHLEN + 1`.\n\nSince the loop body contains assertions that `glob2_p_off` is non-negative and less than `MAXPATHLEN + 1`, we don't need to include these as loop invariants.\n\nAdditionally, since all variables in the program are assigned non-deterministic values, we cannot add any additional constraints on their values.\n\nFinally, we can use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code:\n```\n//@ assert(MAXPATHLEN <= 0 ==> \\forall integer glob2_p_off; 0 <= glob2_p_off <= 0;);\n//@ assert(MAXPATHLEN > 0 ==> (0 <= glob2_pathbuf_off <= bound_off <= MAXPATHLEN && glob2_p_off < MAXPATHLEN + 1));\n```"

Before the loop starts, `glob2_pathbuf_off` is initialized with `pathbuf_off`, which is guaranteed to be non-negative due to the first assertion after the `for` loop. `bound_off` is set to `pathbuf_off + (MAXPATHLEN + 1) - 1`, which ensures that `bound_off` is less than or equal to `MAXPATHLEN`. Therefore, the loop invariant holds.\n2. In every iteration, `glob2_p_off` starts from `glob2_pathbuf_off` and increases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `glob2_pathlim_off`. Hence, `glob2_pathbuf_off <= glob2_p_off <= glob2_pathlim_off` holds. Also, the first assertion in the loop body ensures that `glob2_p_off` is non-negative, and the second assertion ensures that `glob2_p_off` is less than `MAXPATHLEN + 1`. Hence, `0 <= glob2_p_off <= MAXPATHLEN` holds.\n3. After the loop termination, `glob2_pathlim_off` is guaranteed to be less than or equal to `bound_off` and `bound_off` is guaranteed to be less than or equal to `MAXPATHLEN`. Therefore, `glob2_pathbuf_off <= glob2_pathlim_off <= bound_off <= MAXPATHLEN` holds. Also, if `glob2_pathlim_off == bound_off`, then `glob2_p_off` is incremented one more time before the loop exits, which means `glob2_p_off == glob2_pathlim_off + 1`."
