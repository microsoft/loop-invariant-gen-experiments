Therefore, `x` is always less than or equal to 6 in the loop.\n- The loop multiplies `y` by 2 in each iteration. Therefore, `y` is equal to 2 raised to the power of `x`.\n- If `x` is equal to 6, then the loop has executed 6 times and `y` would be equal to 2 raised to the power of 6, which is 64.\n- The assertion is `y != 64`. Therefore, if `x` is not equal to 6, then `y` cannot be equal to 64.\n- The loop invariant `y == 2^x` implies that `y` is always a power of 2 in the loop, which means that it cannot be equal to 64 unless `x` is equal to 6.
