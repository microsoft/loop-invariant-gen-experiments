Initially, `y` is `2^0 = 1`. Therefore, before the loop, `y` is equal to `2^x` where `x` is `0`. Hence, the loop invariant is true before the loop starts.\n- In every iteration of the loop: `1 <= x <= 6 && y == 2^x`\n  - Since `x` is incremented by `1` in each iteration, it starts from `1` and goes up to `6` (inclusive). Hence, the conjunction `1 <= x <= 6` is true in every iteration of the loop. Also, `y` is multiplied by `2` in each iteration. Therefore, `y` is equal to `2^x` for each value of `x` in the range `1` to `6`. Hence, the loop invariant is true in every iteration of the loop.\n- After the loop: `x == 6 && y == 2^x`\n  - The loop terminates when `x` becomes `6`. Hence, after the loop, `x` is equal to `6`. Also, in each iteration of the loop, `y` is multiplied by `2`. Therefore, after the loop, `y` is equal to `2^6 = 64`. Hence, the loop invariant is true after the loop terminates.\n\nPutting it all together:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x <= 6 && y == pow(2, x);\n    loop invariant 1 <= x <= 6 ==> y == pow(2, x);\n    loop invariant x == 6 ==> y == pow(2, x);\n*/\n``` \nNote that we have used the `pow` function from the math library to calculate `2^x`."
