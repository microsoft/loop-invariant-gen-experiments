Before the loop execution:\n- Since `x` can have any integer value, we cannot add any loop invariants here.\n\n2. In every iteration of the loop:\n- We can add the following loop invariants:\n    ```\n    //@ loop invariant x >= 0 && x <= 50;\n    //@ loop invariant (x > 50) ==> \\old(x) < x;\n    //@ loop invariant (x == 0) ==> \\old(x) < x;\n    //@ loop invariant (x < 0) ==> \\false;\n    //@ loop invariant (x > 50) ==> \\false;\n    ```\n\n    Explanation:\n    - The first loop invariant specifies that `x` is always between 0 and 50 (inclusive).\n    - The second loop invariant specifies that if `x` is greater than 50 in the current iteration, then the previous value of `x` was less than `x`. This is because we increment `x` only if it is greater than 50.\n    - The third loop invariant specifies that if `x` is equal to 0 in the current iteration, then the previous value of `x` was less than `x`. This is because we increment `x` only if it is equal to 0.\n    - The fourth loop invariant specifies that if `x` is less than 0 in the current iteration, then the loop is in an invalid state. This is because `x` should always be between 0 and 50 (inclusive).\n    - The fifth loop invariant specifies that if `x` is greater than 50 in the current iteration, then the loop is in an invalid state. This is because `x` should always be between 0 and 50 (inclusive).\n\n3. After the loop termination:\n- We can add the following loop invariant:\n    ```\n    //@ assert (x>=0) && (x<=50);\n    ```\n\n    Explanation:\n    - This loop invariant implies the post-condition of the program. We use an implication here because the assertion is guarded by a condition (`{;`)."
