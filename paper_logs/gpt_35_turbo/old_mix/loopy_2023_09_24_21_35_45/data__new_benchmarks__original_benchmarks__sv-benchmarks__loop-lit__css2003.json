We need to show that `j == i*k + 1` is true. From the loop body, we know that `j` is updated to `j + k` and `i` is updated to `i + 1`.

Therefore, `k` will always be between 0 and 1.\n- After the loop termination, `i` will be greater than or equal to `LARGE_INT` because `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, and the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `LARGE_INT`.

So, 0 <= k <= 1.\n  - i is initialized to 1. So, 1 <= i.\n  - j is initialized to 1. So, j >= 1.\n- In every iteration of the loop:\n  - i is incremented by 1 in every iteration. So, i >= 1.\n  - j is incremented by k in every iteration. So, j == (i - 1) + (1 - k) * (i - 2).\n  - k is decremented by 1 in every iteration. So, 0 <= k <= 1.\n- After the loop termination:\n  - The loop terminates when i >= LARGE_INT. So, i >= LARGE_INT.\n  - The final value of j depends on the value of k in the last iteration. So, j == (LARGE_INT - 1) + (1 - k) * (LARGE_INT - 2).\n  - k has a range of 0 to 1. So, 0 <= k <= 1.\n  - The sum of i and k is used in the assertion. So, 1 <= i + k <= 2.\n\nNote: The assertion is not used in deriving the loop invariants. Instead, the loop invariants are derived to imply the assertion. The implication is handled automatically by Frama-C.",
