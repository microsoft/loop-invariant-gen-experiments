Hence, `x >= 0` is true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop.\n- Similarly, since `y` is initialized to 0 and incremented or decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, `y` can never be negative. Hence, `y >= 0` is true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop.\n- Since `y` is incremented only when `x` is less than 50 and decremented otherwise, `y` can never be larger than `x`. Hence, `y <= x` is true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop.\n- Since `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop and the maximum value of `x` is 100, `x` can never be larger than 100. Hence, `x <= 100` is true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop.\n- Since `y` is incremented only when `x` is less than 50, the maximum value of `y` occurs when `x` is 49 and is equal to 50. Hence, `y <= 50` is true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop.\n- Since `y` is decremented only when `x` is 50 or more, the minimum value of `y` occurs when `x` is 50 and is equal to 0. Hence, `y >= x - 50` is true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop.\n- Since `y` is decremented only when `x` is 50 or more, if `x` is equal to or larger than 50, then `y` can be at most 1. Hence, `((x >= 50) ==> (y <= 1))` is true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop.\n\nVerification:\n- The post-condition is `x == 100`. Since `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, the loop must execute 100 times for the post-condition to be true. Since we know that `x <= 100` in every iteration of the loop, we can conclude that the loop terminates when `x` is equal to 100. Therefore, the post-condition is guaranteed to be true when the loop terminates.",
