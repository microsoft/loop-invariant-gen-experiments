They state that for all values of `k` less than `i1`, `j1` is equal to `k - i2 + j2`. Similarly, for all values of `k` less than `i2`, `j2` is equal to `2*k`.\n\nFinally, we can use the implication `i1 >= n + n && i2 >= n ==> j1 == j2` to use the assertion in the program. This implies that if `i1` and `i2` are both greater than or equal to `n`, then `j1` is equal to `j2`, which is the assertion in the program."

So, i1 >= 0 && i1 <= n+n is an invariant that is true before, during, and after the loop.\n- i2 can take values from 0 to n, since it is also incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. So, i2 >= 0 && i2 <= n is an invariant that is true before, during, and after the loop.\n- j1 is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop when i1 < n+n. Since j1 starts from 0, it will always be equal to i1. Therefore, j1 == i1 is an invariant that is true before, during, and after the loop.\n- j2 is incremented by 2 in each iteration of the loop when i2 < n. Since j2 starts from 0, it will always be equal to 2*i2. Therefore, j2 == 2*i2 is an invariant that is true before, during, and after the loop.\n- The final assertion is j1 == j2. However, since the loop runs indefinitely, we cannot directly use this assertion as a loop invariant. Instead, we use an implication to make it hold when the loop terminates. We know that i1 >= n+n when the loop terminates, since i1 is incremented by 1 in each iteration when it is less than n+n. So, if i1 >= n+n, then j1 == j2, which is equivalent to (i1 >= n+n) ==> (j1 == j2).\n\nTherefore, the necessary loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1 >= 0 && i1 <= n+n;\n    loop invariant i2 >= 0 && i2 <= n;\n    loop invariant j1 == i1;\n    loop invariant j2 == 2*i2;\n    loop invariant (i1 >= n+n) ==> (j1 == j2);\n*/\n```"
