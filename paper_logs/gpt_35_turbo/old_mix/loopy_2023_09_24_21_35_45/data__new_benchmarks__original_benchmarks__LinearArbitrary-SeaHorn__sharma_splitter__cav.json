In the loop, x is incremented by 1 in each iteration. Since x starts at 0 and the loop terminates when flag is greater than or equal to 1, the maximum value of x can be 51. Similarly, the minimum value of x is 0. The variable y is incremented by 1 when x is less than or equal to 50, and decremented by 1 otherwise. Since y starts at 0 and the loop terminates when y is less than 0, the maximum value of y can be 51 and the minimum value can be 0. The variable flag is updated to 1 when y becomes less than 0, and the loop terminates when flag is greater than or equal to 1. Hence, the maximum value of flag can be 1 and the minimum value is 0.\n\n- In every iteration of the loop, if x is less than or equal to 50, then y is incremented by 1, else it is decremented by 1. This is captured in the first two parts of the loop invariant. The third part says that if y is greater than or equal to 0, then flag remains the same as its previous value, otherwise it is updated to 1. The fourth part says that if flag is less than 1, then y is greater than or equal to 0. This is because if y is less than 0, flag would have already been updated to 1, and the loop would have terminated. The fifth part says that if x is less than 51, then flag remains the same as its previous value. This is because if flag is updated to 1, the loop would have terminated.\n\n- After the loop termination, flag should be greater than or equal to 1, since the loop terminates when flag is updated to 1. If flag is greater than or equal to 1, then y should be less than or equal to 51, since y becomes negative when flag is updated to 1. Also, since x is incremented by 1 in each iteration, its maximum value can be 102. Hence, the assertion states that if flag is greater than or equal to 1, then x is less than or equal to 102 and y is less than or equal to 51."

Also, both `x` and `y` must be non-negative, hence greater than or equal to `0`.\n- After the loop ends, if `y` is non-negative (i.e., `y>=0`), then `x` must be less than or equal to `102` because the loop ends only when `y` becomes negative or `y<0`. On the other hand, if `y` is negative (i.e., `y<0`), then `flag` must be `1`. Therefore, the assertion can be written as `(y>=0 ==> x<=102) && (y<0 ==> flag==1)` using implication."

We can observe that x is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, while y is incremented or decremented by 1 depending on the value of x.\n\nTherefore, we can add the following loop invariants for x and y:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= x <= 102;\n    loop invariant 0 <= y <= 51;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have added the upper bounds by observing that x is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop and y is incremented or decremented by 1 depending on the value of x. The maximum value of x can be 102 (when the loop terminates) and the maximum value of y can be 51 (when x=50 and y=51).\n\nNow, let's consider the variable flag. We can see that flag is set to 1 when y becomes negative. Therefore, we can add the following loop invariant for flag:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant flag==0 ==> y>=0;\n*/\n```\nThis invariant states that if flag is 0, then y must be greater than or equal to 0. This is true because flag is set to 1 only when y becomes negative.\n\nFinally, we need to ensure that the loop invariants imply the post-condition. The post-condition is:\n```\n//@ assert(x<=102);\n//@ assert(y<=51);\n```\nNote that the post-conditions are guarded by the condition flag < 1. Therefore, we need to add this condition in the implication. We can add the following loop invariant to ensure that the loop invariants imply the post-conditions:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant (flag==1 || (flag==0 && x<=102 && y<=51));\n*/\n```\nThis invariant states that if flag is 1, then the loop has terminated and the post-conditions must hold. If flag is 0, then the loop invariants must hold, which we have already defined for x, y and flag.\n\nTherefore, the complete set of loop invariants for the given program is:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= x <= 102;\n    loop invariant 0 <= y <= 51;\n    loop invariant flag==0 ==> y>=0;\n    loop invariant (flag==1 || (flag==0 && x<=102 && y<=51));\n*/\n```"

Similarly, since y is incremented or decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, the maximum value of y is 51.\n- The third loop invariant states that if flag is 0, then y is always between 0 and x+1. This is because if x is less than or equal to 50, then y is incremented by 1, so y is always at least as large as x+1. If x is greater than 50, then y is not decremented, so y remains at most as large as 51.\n- The fourth loop invariant states that if flag is 1, then y is always between -1 and x-50. This is because if y becomes negative, flag is set to 1 and the loop terminates. Therefore, y is always non-negative until flag is set to 1. Once flag is set to 1, y is decremented in each iteration of the loop, so y is at most x-50.\n- The fifth loop invariant states that if x is less than or equal to 50 and flag is 0, then y is always between 1 and x+1. This is because if x is less than or equal to 50, then y is incremented by 1, so y is always at least as large as 1. If flag is 0, then y is not decremented, so y remains at most as large as x+1.\n- The sixth loop invariant states that if x is greater than 50 and flag is 0, then y is always between 0 and 51. This is because if x is greater than 50, then y is not incremented, so y remains at least as large as 0. If flag is 0, then y is not decremented, so y remains at most as large as 51.\n- The seventh loop invariant states that if x is less than or equal to 50 and flag is 1, then x is always between y-1 and 101. This is because if flag is 1, then y is always negative, so x is always at least as large as y-1.
