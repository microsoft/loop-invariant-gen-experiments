Since the value of tmp is non-deterministic, we cannot make any assumptions about the change in x and z values. Hence, we need to add an invariant that takes care of both cases where tmp is true or false.\n- After the loop termination: We need to assert that the loop terminates with the correct post-condition. Since the loop terminates only when x is greater than or equal to 100 or z is less than or equal to 100, we need to add this condition in the invariant. Also, we need to ensure that the assertion holds only when the loop has terminated.

Thus, we add the following conjunction for x: \n        - x >= INT_MIN && x <= INT_MAX\n    - z is always greater than or equal to INT_MIN and less than or equal to INT_MAX, as we do not have any conditions that limit the value of z in the loop body. Thus, we add the following conjunction for z: \n        - z >= INT_MIN && z <= INT_MAX\n    - If tmp is true, then x is incremented by 1. Thus, in each iteration of the loop, either x is incremented by 1 or decremented by 1. Therefore, we can add the following conjunction for x and z: \n        - x + z <= 2 * (unknown_int() + 100)\n- After the loop termination:\n    - The loop terminates when either x >= 100 or z <= 100. Therefore, we can add the following conjunction for x and z: \n        - (x >= 100 ==> z >= 100) && (z <= 100 ==> x >= 100)\n- Since the assertion is always false, we can use the loop invariant that we have derived to prove the assertion.
