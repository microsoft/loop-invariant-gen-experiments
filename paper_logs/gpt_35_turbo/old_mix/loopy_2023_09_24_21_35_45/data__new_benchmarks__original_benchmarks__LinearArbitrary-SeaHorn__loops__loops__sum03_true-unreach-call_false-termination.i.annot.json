Therefore, `x` must be between 0 and 1000000 before the loop execution.\n- Also, `sn` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.\n- In every iteration of the loop, `sn` is updated by adding 2 to it and `x` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `sn` should be equal to `(x-1)*2` before the update or it should remain 0 if the loop has not executed yet.\n- After the loop termination, `x` should be equal to or greater than 1000000, which implies that the loop has executed at least 1000000 times. Therefore, `sn` should be equal to `(x-1)*2` or it should remain 0 if the loop did not execute at all.\n\nNote that we have used implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. Also, we have added conjunctions to bound the maximum and minimum values that `x` can take. Since `sn` is always greater than or equal to 0, we don't need to add any bounds for `sn`."
