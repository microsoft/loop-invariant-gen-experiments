Therefore, we cannot use `MAXPATHLEN` in any loop invariants.\n- The value of `glob2_p_off` is initialized to `glob2_pathbuf_off`, and incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. Therefore, `glob2_p_off` takes all integer values between `glob2_pathbuf_off` and `glob2_pathlim_off`, inclusive.\n- From the assignment `bound_off = pathbuf_off + (MAXPATHLEN + 1) - 1`, we know that `bound_off` is equal to `pathbuf_off + MAXPATHLEN`. Therefore, `bound_off` is greater than or equal to `pathbuf_off`.\n- The loop body does not modify the values of `MAXPATHLEN`, `pathbuf_off`, `bound_off`, `glob2_pathbuf_off`, and `glob2_pathlim_off`. Therefore, their values remain unchanged during each iteration of the loop.\n- The loop body contains an assertion that `glob2_p_off` is between 0 and `MAXPATHLEN`. Therefore, we can add this assertion as a loop invariant. However, since this assertion is not true for all values of `glob2_p_off` outside the loop, we need to use an implication to make the invariant true at the beginning and end of the loop.\n- The loop body contains another assertion that `glob2_p_off` is less than `MAXPATHLEN + 1`. Therefore, we can add this assertion as another loop invariant. Again, we need to use an implication to make the invariant true at the beginning and end of the loop.\n\nPutting all the loop invariants together, we have:\n```\n/*@\nloop invariant glob2_pathbuf_off <= glob2_p_off <= glob2_pathlim_off;\nloop invariant bound_off >= pathbuf_off;\nloop invariant 0 <= glob2_p_off ==> (glob2_p_off < MAXPATHLEN + 1);\nloop invariant glob2_p_off <= glob2_pathlim_off ==> (glob2_p_off < MAXPATHLEN + 1);\n*/\n```"
