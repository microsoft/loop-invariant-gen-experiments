Given a program, you can find loop invariants, which can then be used to verify some property in the program. \nFrama-C is a software verification tool for C programs. The input to Frama-C is a C program file with ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations.\nFor the given program, find the necessary loop invariants of the while loop to help Frama-C verify the post-condition.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. \n- Output loop invariants that are true \n(i) before the loop execution, \n(ii) in every iteration of the loop and \n(iii) after the loop termination, \nsuch that the loop invariants imply the post condition.\n- If a loop invariant is a conjunction, split it into its parts.\n- Output all the loop invariants in one code block. For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values.

Also, y is incremented by 1 in each iteration.\n   - The expression (y*(y+1))/2 represents the sum of first y natural numbers, and (x*y) represents the sum of x for y terms. Therefore, the sum of first y natural numbers and the sum of x for y terms is added to z in each iteration.\n   - The expression (w*(w-2))/4 represents the sum of even numbers up to w-2, which is added to z in each iteration if w is even.\n   - Since x is incremented by 1 whenever z is odd, either z is even or x is odd after each iteration.\n   - Same as before, if w is even, then z should always be greater or equal to i-j.\n3. After the loop termination:\n   - The loop terminates when the condition unknown2() is false, which means that the value of x should be equal to the value of y at that point.\n\nNote that all the loop invariants together imply the post-condition, which is x == y after the loop termination."

Before the loop execution:\n   - x, y, and w are initialized to 0, and z is initialized to 1.\n   - Since w is always incremented by 2 in each iteration, if w is even, then z should always be greater or equal to i-j (which is 1 in this case). This is because each iteration adds even value to w, which means that z should increase by an even value, and since it starts from 1, it will always be greater or equal to 1 if w is even.\n2. In every iteration of the loop:\n   - The value of z is updated by adding x, y, and w to its previous value. Also, y is incremented by 1 in each iteration.\n   - The expression (y*(y+1))/2 represents the sum of first y natural numbers, and (x*y) represents the sum of x for y terms. Therefore, the sum of first y natural numbers and the sum of x for y terms is added to z in each iteration.\n   - The expression (w*(w-2))/4 represents the sum of even numbers up to w-2, which is added to z in each iteration if w is even.\n   - Since x is incremented by 1 whenever z is odd, either z is even or x is odd after each iteration.\n   - Same as before, if w is even, then z should always be greater or equal to i-j.\n3. After the loop termination:\n   - The loop terminates when the condition unknown2() is false, which means that the value of x should be equal to the value of y at that point.\n\nNote that all the loop invariants together imply the post-condition, which is x == y after the loop termination.",
