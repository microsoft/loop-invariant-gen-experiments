However, since the loop executes while x<100, we can say that x<=100 before the loop execution.\n    - Since y is non-deterministic, we can only say that it is less than or equal to some maximum value. The maximum value is given by the pre-condition y <= 1000000.\n    - If y>0, then the loop will execute and x will be incremented by y in each iteration. Therefore, the maximum value of x can be 100 - y. Hence, the invariant y > 0 ==> x <= 100 - y.\n    - If y<=0, then the loop will not execute. Therefore, the maximum value of x can be 100.

The first part of the conjunction `(x < 100 ==> y <= 0)` implies that if `x` is less than `100`, then `y` must be less than or equal to `0`. The second part of the conjunction `(x >= 100 || y <= 0 || y > 0)` implies that if `x` is greater than or equal to `100`, or `y` is less than or equal to `0`, or `y` is greater than `0`, then the conjunction is true. This covers all possible cases and ensures that the loop invariant is true in every iteration of the loop.\n- The sixth loop invariant `x >= 100 || y <= 0` is true after the loop termination. If the loop terminates, then `y` must be less than or equal to `0` since the loop condition implies `y > 0`. Therefore, the conjunction is true. If the loop does not terminate, then `x` will continue to increase by `y` and eventually become greater than or equal to `100`. Therefore, the conjunction is also true.",
