In each iteration, `res` is incremented by 1 and `cnt` is decremented by 1. Therefore, at any point in the loop, `res` is equal to `a` plus the number of times the loop has executed, which is `(b - cnt)`.\n- In every iteration of the loop: `(cnt >= 0) && (res == a + (b - cnt))`.\n    - Explanation: `cnt` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, so it should always be greater than or equal to 0. Also, in each iteration, `res` is incremented by 1 and `cnt` is decremented by 1. Therefore, at any point in the loop, `res` is equal to `a` plus the number of times the loop has executed, which is `(b - cnt)`.\n- After loop termination: `(cnt == 0) ==> (res == a + b)`.\n    - Explanation: After the loop terminates, `cnt` is equal to 0. Therefore, `res` should be equal to `a + b`, as it has been incremented `b` times. We use implication here because the assertion is guarded by a condition. \n\nVariable bounds:\n- `a` is between `INT_MIN` and `1000000`, inclusive.\n    - Explanation: `a` is initialized to the return value of `unknown_int()`, and we don't know anything about the range of values that function can return. However, we do know that `a` should be less than or equal to 1000000, as stated in the pre-condition. Therefore, we can assume that `a` is between `INT_MIN` and `1000000`, inclusive.\n- `b` is between 0 and 1000000, inclusive.\n    - Explanation: This is explicitly stated in the pre-condition.\n- `res` is between `a` and `a + 1000000`, inclusive.\n    - Explanation: `res` is initialized to `a`, and in each iteration of the loop, it is incremented by 1. Therefore, the maximum value of `res` is `a + 1000000`. The minimum value of `res` is `a`, as it is initialized to `a`.\n- `cnt` is between 0 and `b`, inclusive.\n    - Explanation: `cnt` is initialized to `b`, and in each iteration of the loop, it is decremented by 1. Therefore, the maximum value of `cnt` is `b`. The minimum value of `cnt` is 0, as it is the loop condition. \n\nPutting all together, the loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant res >= a && res <= a + 1000000;\n    loop invariant cnt >= 0 && cnt <= b;\n    loop invariant res == a + (b - cnt);\n    loop invariant (cnt == 0) ==> (res == a + b);\n    loop invariant (cnt > 0) ==> (res == a + b - cnt + 1);\n*/\n```"
