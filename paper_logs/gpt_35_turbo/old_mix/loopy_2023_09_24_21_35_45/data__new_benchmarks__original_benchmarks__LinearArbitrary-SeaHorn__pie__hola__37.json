After the loop termination, we have:\n    - 0 <= x <= n\n    - m <= x\n    - if n > 0 ==> 0 <= m < n\n    \n    Explanation: The above invariant says that m is less than or equal to x, and if n is positive, then m must be between 0 and n-1. This implies the post-condition that 0 <= m < n if n is positive. If n is not positive, then the post-condition is vacuously true.\n    \nNote: Since there are no non-deterministic variables in the program, we do not need to use any implications to make the loop invariants trivially true. \n\nPutting it all together, the loop invariants for the given program are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= x <= n;\n    loop invariant m == 0;\n    loop invariant n == unknown1();\n    \n    loop invariant 0 <= x <= n;\n    loop invariant m <= x;\n    loop invariant (m < x ==> !unknown2());\n    \n    loop invariant 0 <= x <= n;\n    loop invariant m <= x;\n    loop invariant (n > 0 ==> 0 <= m < n);\n*/\n```"
