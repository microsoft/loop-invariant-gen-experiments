If it evaluates to false, the function returns 0, which means the program terminates.\n- The function `errorFn()` contains an infinite loop and is not called in the program.\n- The post-condition is an assertion that checks if the variable `x` is equal to 0.\n\nVariable Assignments:\n- `i` is assigned the value 0.\n- `x` is assigned the value 0.\n- `NONDET` is not assigned any value. It is a non-deterministic variable.\n\nLoop Condition:\n- The loop executes while `i` is less than 1.\n\nLoop Body:\n- The variable `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.\n- If the non-deterministic variable `NONDET` is greater than 0, `x` is decremented by 1 in that iteration.\n\nPost-condition:\n- The assertion checks if the variable `x` is equal to 0 at the end of the loop.\n\nLoop Invariants:\n- Before the loop:\n    - `i == 0`\n    - `x == 0`\n    - `NONDET ==> (NONDET > 0)`\n    - `(!NONDET) ==> (NONDET <= 0)`\n- In every iteration:\n    - `i >= 0`\n    - `x >= 0`\n    - `i <= 1`\n- After the loop:\n    - `i == 1`\n    - `(x == 0) ==> (!(NONDET > 0))`\n    - `(!((x == 0))) ==> (!(NONDET <= 0))`\n\nExplanation:\n- Before the loop, the variables are initialized to their initial values. The first two loop invariants ensure that `i` and `x` have their initial values.\n- The third and fourth loop invariants take care of the non-deterministic variable `NONDET`. If `NONDET` is greater than 0, the third invariant is true, otherwise the fourth invariant is true.\n- In every iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so it is always greater than or equal to 0. Similarly, `x` is incremented by 1 or decremented by 1, so it is always greater than or equal to 0. `i` is less than or equal to 1, because the loop condition is `i < 1`.\n- After the loop, `i` is equal to 1, because the loop condition is `i < 1`. If `x` is equal to 0, then the non-deterministic variable `NONDET` must not be greater than 0, because if it is greater than 0, then `x` would have been decremented by 1 at some point, which would violate the assertion. This is captured by the fifth loop invariant. If `x` is not equal to 0, then `NONDET` must be greater than 0, because otherwise `x` would not have been decremented at any point, which would again violate the assertion.

Hence, `i` must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1 throughout the loop. \n- Since `x` is initialized to 0, it satisfies the loop invariant. `x` can only increase by 1 in each iteration of the loop, so it must be non-negative throughout the loop.\n\n- In every iteration of the loop, we have:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i >= 0 && i <= 1;\n    loop invariant x >= 0 && x <= i;\n*/\n```\nExplanation:\n- The loop invariant `i >= 0 && i <= 1` is preserved in every iteration of the loop because `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration and the loop condition ensures that `i` can never be greater than 1.\n- The loop invariant `x >= 0 && x <= i` is preserved in every iteration of the loop because `x` is either incremented by 1 or decremented by 1 in each iteration, but it can never be greater than `i`.\n\n- After the loop termination, we have:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i == 1;\n    loop invariant x == 1 || x == 0;\n    loop invariant !(x != 0) ==> !(NONDET > 0);\n*/\n```\nExplanation:\n- The loop invariant `i == 1` holds because the loop terminates when `i` becomes 1.\n- The loop invariant `x == 1 || x == 0` holds because `x` can only be incremented or decremented in each iteration of the loop, and the loop terminates when `i` becomes 1.\n- The assertion is guarded by the condition `i == 1`, so we use implication to state the loop invariant. If `x` is not equal to 0 at the end of the loop, then `i` must be equal to 1, which contradicts the loop condition `i < 1`. Hence, the assertion is true if `x` is equal to 0 at the end of the loop.\n- We know that `NONDET` is non-deterministic, so we use implication to state that if `x` is not equal to 0 at the end of the loop, then `NONDET` must be less than or equal to 0. This implication ensures that if `x` is not equal to 0, then the condition `NONDET > 0` cannot be true, which implies that `x` must be equal to 0."

Since the loop executes only once, we only need to find one loop invariant that implies the post-condition. Let's analyze the loop body:\n```\nx++;\nif (NONDET > 0 ){\n  x--;\n}\ni++;\n```\nFrom the loop body, we can see that the value of `x` can only increase by 1 or stay the same. Also, the value of `i` can only increase by 1. Since the loop executes only once, we can say that the final value of `x` will be either 0 or 1. \n\nBased on this analysis, we can propose the following loop invariant:\n```\n/*@\n   loop invariant 0 <= i <= 1;\n   loop invariant 0 <= x <= 1;\n   loop invariant (NONDET > 0) ==> (x == \\at(x, Pre) - 1);\n   loop invariant (NONDET <= 0) ==> (x == \\at(x, Pre) + 1);\n*/\n```\nExplanation:\n- The first two loop invariants bound the values of `i` and `x` between 0 and 1, which is the range of possible values they can take after the loop.\n- The third loop invariant is an implication that says if `NONDET` is greater than 0, then the value of `x` decreased by 1 in the current iteration. This handles the case where `NONDET` is positive and the if statement is executed, which causes `x` to decrement by 1.\n- The fourth loop invariant is an implication that says if `NONDET` is less than or equal to 0, then the value of `x` increased by 1 in the current iteration.
