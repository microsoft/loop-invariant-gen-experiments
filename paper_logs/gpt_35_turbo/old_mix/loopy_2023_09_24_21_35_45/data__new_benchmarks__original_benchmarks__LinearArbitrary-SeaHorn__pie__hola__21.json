Let's begin by analyzing the program:\n\nPre-conditions or variable assignments:\n- `c1 = 4000`: assigns a value to variable `c1`.\n- `c2 = 2000`: assigns a value to variable `c2`.\n- `n = unknown1()`: assigns a non-deterministic value to variable `n` by calling an external function `unknown1()`.\n- `assume (n > 0 && n < 10)`: assumes that `n` is greater than 0 and less than 10.\n\nLoop condition:\n- `while( i < n )`: the loop will execute as long as variable `i` is less than `n`.\n\nLoop body:\n- `i++`: increments the value of `i` by 1.\n- `if(unknown2() % 2 == 0) v = 0; else v = 1;`: assigns a value to variable `v` based on the result of calling an external function `unknown2()`.\n- `if( v == 0 ) k += c1; else k += c2;`: adds the value of either `c1` or `c2` to variable `k` based on the value of `v`.\n\nPost-condition:\n- `//@ assert(k>n);`: asserts that the value of `k` is greater than `n`.\n\nNow, let's try to find the necessary loop invariants:\n\nBefore the loop execution:\n- `k >= 0`: since `k` is initialized to 0, it must be greater than or equal to 0.\n\nIn every iteration of the loop:\n- `i >= 0`: since `i` is incremented by 1 in every iteration, it must be greater than or equal to 0.\n- `i <= n`: since the loop condition is `while( i < n )`, `i` must always be less than or equal to `n`.\n- `k >= 0`: the value of `k` must be greater than or equal to 0.\n- `k <= c1*n + c2*n`: the maximum value of `k` can be obtained when `v` is equal to 0 in every iteration, which results in `k` being equal to `c1*n`. The minimum value of `k` can be obtained when `v` is equal to 1 in every iteration, which results in `k` being equal to `c2*n`. Therefore, the value of `k` must be between `c1*n` and `c2*n`.\n\nAfter the loop termination:\n- `i == n`: since the loop condition is `while( i < n )`, when the loop terminates, `i` must be equal to `n`.\n- `k >= c1*n`: from the loop invariant `k <= c1*n + c2*n`, we can derive `k >= c1*n`, which implies that `k` must be greater than or equal to `c1*n`.\n- `k >= c2*n`: from the loop invariant `k <= c1*n + c2*n`, we can derive `k >= c2*n`, which implies that `k` must be greater than or equal to `c2*n`.\n- `k > n`: from the post-condition `//@ assert(k>n);` and the loop invariant `k >= c1*n`, we can derive `c1*n > n`, which simplifies to `c1 > 1`. Therefore, we can add the loop invariant `c1 > 1 ==> k > n` to ensure that the post-condition holds.\n\nPutting it all together, the loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i >= 0;\n    loop invariant i <= n;\n    loop invariant k >= 0;\n    loop invariant k <= c1*n + c2*n;\n    loop invariant c1 > 1 ==> k > n;\n    loop assigns i, k;\n*/\n``` \nNote that we have added `loop assigns i, k;` to specify which variables are modified in the loop."

If `v` is 0, `c1` is added to `k`, otherwise `c2` is added to `k`.\n- We can see that the maximum value of `k` is achieved when `v` is always equal to 0 and the minimum value of `k` is achieved when `v` is always equal to 1. Therefore, `0 <= k <= i * c1 + (n - i) * c2`.\n- After the loop, `k` should be equal to `i * c1 + (n - i) * c2` since `k` is updated in every iteration of the loop based on the value of `v`. \n- The assertion checks if `k` is greater than `n`, which is only possible if `i` is equal to `n`, since `k` is equal to `i * c1 + (n - i) * c2`.

It is derived from the code, where `k` is updated with either `c1` or `c2` based on the value of `v`. Since `v` can only take values 0 or 1, either `c1` or `c2` will be added to `k` in each iteration. By expanding this expression, we get the relation between `k`, `c1`, `c2`, `i`, and `j`.\n    - `v == 0 || v == 1` ensures that `v` can only take values 0 or 1.\n    - `j <= i` ensures that `j` is always less than or equal to `i`, which is required for the relation between `k`, `c1`, `c2`, `i`, and `j` to hold.\n\n- After the loop termination:\n    - `k == c1 * n || k == c2 * n`\n    \n    Explanation:\n    - Since the loop executes exactly `n` times, the value of `k` is either `c1 * n` or `c2 * n` at the end of the loop. This is derived from the code, where `k` is updated with either `c1` or `c2` in each iteration based on the value of `v`. If `v` is always 0 or always 1, then `k` will be equal to `c1 * n` or `c2 * n` respectively at the end of the loop.",

If `v` is 0, `c1` is added to `k`, otherwise `c2` is added to `k`.\n- We can see that the maximum value of `k` is achieved when `v` is always equal to 0 and the minimum value of `k` is achieved when `v` is always equal to 1. Therefore, `0 <= k <= i * c1 + (n - i) * c2`.\n- After the loop, `k` should be equal to `i * c1 + (n - i) * c2` since `k` is updated in every iteration of the loop based on the value of `v`. \n- The assertion checks if `k` is greater than `n`, which is only possible if `i` is equal to `n`, since `k` is equal to `i * c1 + (n - i) * c2`. Therefore, we can add the implication `i == n ==> k > n` to the loop invariant after the loop.",

The second invariant is also true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop, since k is initialized to 0 before the loop and is incremented by either c1 or c2 in every iteration. The third invariant is true before the loop execution, since there are no previous values of v and k is initialized to 0. In every iteration of the loop, the value of v is either 0 or 1, and the value of k is updated accordingly. Finally, after the loop termination, the value of k is equal to the sum of all the previous values of (v*c2 + (1-v)*c1), which is greater than n if and only if at least one of the values of v is equal to 1. This is captured by the last invariant, which uses an implication to take into account the exit condition of the loop."
