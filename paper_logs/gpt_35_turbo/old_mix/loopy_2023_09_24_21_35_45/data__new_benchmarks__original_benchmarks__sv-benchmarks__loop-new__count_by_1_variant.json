Therefore, we can add the loop invariant i != LARGE_INT ==> i <= LARGE_INT. This implies that if i is not equal to LARGE_INT, then i is less than or equal to LARGE_INT.\n- After the loop termination: After the loop termination, we know that i is equal to LARGE_INT because the loop condition is i != LARGE_INT. Therefore, we can add the loop invariant i == LARGE_INT ==> i <= LARGE_INT. This implies that if i is equal to LARGE_INT, then i is less than or equal to LARGE_INT.\n\nCombining all the loop invariants, we get:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i != LARGE_INT ==> i <= LARGE_INT;\n    loop invariant i == LARGE_INT ==> i <= LARGE_INT;\n*/\n```"

Therefore, i is greater than or equal to LARGE_INT.\n\nSince the loop invariant is true in every iteration of the loop, we can use an implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. Therefore, we can write the loop invariant as follows:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= i <= LARGE_INT;\n    loop invariant (i == LARGE_INT) ==> \\true;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have added a lower bound of 0 for i, since it starts from 0.
