Also, from the variable assignments, we know that x is greater than or equal to 0 and y is greater than or equal to 50. Therefore, x <= 100 && x >= 0 && y <= 100 && y >= 50 is a valid loop invariant.\n- In every iteration: We can split the loop body into two cases:\n    - Case 1: x < 50\n        - In this case, the condition \"x < 50\" is true, so the if statement is executed. Since x is incremented by 1, we know that x is still less than 50 in the next iteration, and y remains unchanged at 50. Therefore, (x < 50 ==> y == 50) is a valid loop invariant.\n    - Case 2: x >= 50\n        - In this case, the condition \"x < 50\" is false, so the else statement is executed. Since x is incremented by 1 and y is incremented by 1, we know that y is equal to x + 50 in the next iteration. Therefore, (x >= 50 ==> y == x + 50) is a valid loop invariant.\n    - Combining the two cases, we get the loop invariant: (x < 50 ==> y == 50) && (x >= 50 ==> y == x + 50)\n- After loop termination: Since the loop condition is \"x < 100\" and x is incremented by 1 in each iteration, we know that x is equal to 100 after the loop terminates. Therefore, if x is equal to 100, y must also be equal to 100. This can be expressed as x == 100 ==> y == 100."
