This is true because 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, and 2^6 are all divisible by 3, but 2^1 is not. Therefore, if y is divisible by 3, then x must be at least 2. Also, if x is greater than 6, then y will be greater than 2^6, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, if y is divisible by 3, then x must be at most 6.

Therefore, the second invariant `x <= 6` holds true in every iteration.\n- The third invariant `y % 3 == 0 ==> (\\forall unsigned int i; i <= x; 2^i % 3 == 0)` holds true before the loop execution, as `y` is initially 1 and the implication is trivially true. In every iteration of the loop, `y` is multiplied by 2, which preserves the property that `y` is a power of 2.

The loop invariant should hold true. Since, `y` is equal to 2 to the power of `x` before the loop and `x` is 0, we have `y == pow(2,x)` as the loop invariant before the loop.\n- In every iteration: In each iteration of the loop, `x` is incremented by 1 and `y` is multiplied by 2. Thus, `y` is equal to 2 to the power of `x` in every iteration. Hence, `y == pow(2,x)` is the loop invariant that holds true in every iteration.\n- After the loop: After the loop, `x` is 6 and `y` is 2 to the power of 6, which is 64. The assertion checks whether `y` is divisible by 3. Since `64 % 3` is not equal to 0, the assertion fails. Therefore, we need to add an implication to the loop invariant that makes sure that `y` is divisible by 3. Since `y` is equal to 2 to the power of `x`, we need to add the implication `(y % 3 == 0) ==> (y == pow(2,x))`.

Therefore, we can add the loop invariant x <= 6. Also, the value of y is multiplied by 2 in every iteration, which means that y will be equal to 2^x after x iterations. Therefore, we can add the loop invariant y == 2^x.\n- After loop termination: We want to prove that y is divisible by 3 after the loop terminates. Since y is multiplied by 2 in every iteration, we know that y will be divisible by 2^6 = 64 after the loop terminates. Therefore, we can write the implication x == 6 ==> y % 64 == 0. Since 64 is not divisible by 3, we need to find another number that is divisible by 3 and also a power of 2. The smallest such number is 8 = 2^3. Therefore, we can write the implication y % 64 == 0 ==> y % 8 == 0. Combining these two implications using transitivity of implication, we get x == 6 ==> y % 8 == 0.

Also, since `y` is a power of 2 before the loop and is doubled in each iteration, `y` is a multiple of 2^6 = 64. Therefore, `y` is also a multiple of 3 if it is a multiple of 64.

Since y is multiplied by 2 in every iteration, we know that y will be divisible by 2^6 = 64 after the loop terminates. Therefore, we can write the implication x == 6 ==> y % 64 == 0. Since 64 is not divisible by 3, we need to find another number that is divisible by 3 and also a power of 2. The smallest such number is 8 = 2^3. Therefore, we can write the implication y % 64 == 0 ==> y % 8 == 0. Combining these two implications using transitivity of implication, we get x == 6 ==> y % 8 == 0.
