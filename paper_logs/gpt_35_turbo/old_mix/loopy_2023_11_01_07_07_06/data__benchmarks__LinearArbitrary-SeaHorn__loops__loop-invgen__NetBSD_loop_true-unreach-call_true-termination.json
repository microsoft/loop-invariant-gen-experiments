Therefore, at the end of each iteration, either `glob2_p_off` is incremented or the loop terminates. Thus, `glob2_p_off` is always less than or equal to `glob2_pathlim_off + 1`.\n- The third loop invariant `glob2_pathbuf_off == pathbuf_off` holds true before the loop is executed because `glob2_pathbuf_off` is assigned the value `pathbuf_off`.\n- The fourth loop invariant `glob2_pathlim_off == bound_off` holds true before the loop is executed because `glob2_pathlim_off` is assigned the value `bound_off`.\n- The fifth loop invariant `pathbuf_off == 0` holds true before the loop is executed because `pathbuf_off` is explicitly assigned the value 0.\n- The sixth loop invariant `MAXPATHLEN > 0 && MAXPATHLEN < 2147483647` holds true before the loop is executed because it is given as a pre-condition.\n- The seventh loop invariant `bound_off == pathbuf_off + MAXPATHLEN` holds true before the loop is executed because `bound_off` is assigned the value `pathbuf_off + (MAXPATHLEN + 1) - 1`.\n- The eighth loop invariant `glob2_p_off <= glob2_pathlim_off ==> glob2_p_off <= bound_off` holds true in every iteration of the loop because `glob2_pathlim_off` is assigned the value `bound_off` and `glob2_p_off` is always less than or equal to `glob2_pathlim_off`. Therefore, `glob2_p_off` is always less than or equal to `bound_off`.\n- The ninth loop invariant `glob2_p_off <= glob2_pathlim_off ==> glob2_pathbuf_off == pathbuf_off` holds true in every iteration of the loop because `glob2_pathbuf_off` is assigned the value `pathbuf_off` and `glob2_p_off` is always less than or equal to `glob2_pathlim_off`. Therefore, `glob2_pathbuf_off` is always equal to `pathbuf_off`.\n- The tenth loop invariant `glob2_p_off <= glob2_pathlim_off ==> glob2_pathlim_off == bound_off` holds true in every iteration of the loop because `glob2_pathlim_off` is assigned the value `bound_off` and `glob2_p_off` is always less than or equal to `glob2_pathlim_off`. Therefore, `glob2_pathlim_off` is always equal to `bound_off`. \n\nPutting it all together:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= glob2_p_off;\n    loop",
