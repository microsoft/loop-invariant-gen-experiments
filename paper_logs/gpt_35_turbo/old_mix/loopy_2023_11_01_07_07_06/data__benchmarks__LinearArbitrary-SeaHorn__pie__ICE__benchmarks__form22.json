If the condition `x1p <= x2p && (x2p >= 0 || x2p - x3p <= 2)` holds, it updates `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` with the values of `x1p`, `x2p`, and `x3p`, respectively. \n\nFinally, it verifies the assertion `x1 <= x2 && (x2 >= 0 || x2 - x3 <= 2)` and terminates. \n\nNote that `unknown_int()` returns a non-deterministic integer value.\n\n**Pre-conditions:**\n\nNone.\n\n**Variables:**\n\n- `x1`, `x2`, and `x3`: These variables are initialized to zero at the beginning of the program and are updated in the loop.\n\n- `x1p`, `x2p`, and `x3p`: These variables are assigned non-deterministic integer values in each iteration of the loop.\n\n- `input`: This variable is assigned a non-deterministic integer value at the beginning of the loop and determines the number of iterations of the loop.\n\n**Loop Invariants:**\n\n1.

Therefore, we can express this as:\n    \n        `(x2 >= 0) ==> (x2 - x3 <= 2)`\n    \n    Therefore, we can combine (b), (c), and (d) as:\n    \n        `x2 >= 0 ==> (x2 < 0 ==> x2 - x3 <= -1) && (x2 >= 0 ==> x2 - x3 <= 2)`\n    \n    e.
