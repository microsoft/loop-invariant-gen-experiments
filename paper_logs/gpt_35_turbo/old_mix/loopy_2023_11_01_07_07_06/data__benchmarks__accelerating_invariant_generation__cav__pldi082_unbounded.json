The loop will exit only when `break` is called.\n\nLoop invariants:\n- `x >= 0`\n    - `x` is initialized to 0, and is incremented by 1 in every iteration of the loop. Therefore, `x` is always greater than or equal to 0.\n- `y >= 0`\n    - `y` is initialized to 0, and is incremented by 1 in the loop body only if `x <= N`. Therefore, `y` is always greater than or equal to 0.\n- `y >= x - N`\n    - If `x <= N`, then `y` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `y >= x - N`.\n    - If `x >= N+1`, then `y` is decremented by 1.

Therefore, `x + 1 <= N + y`, which implies `y >= -1`.\n    - If `x >= N+1`, then `y` is decremented by 1 only if `y >= 0`.

Since `x` is initialized to 0, it satisfies the first loop invariant. For `y`, we can use an implication to make the invariant trivially true at the beginning of the loop since it is non-deterministic. Thus, `-1 <= y` always holds true at the beginning of the loop. \n- In every iteration of the loop, `x` is incremented and `y` is either incremented or decremented. Thus, we need to update the loop invariants accordingly. Since `x` starts at 0 and is incremented in every iteration, it should be less than or equal to `N+1` to ensure that the loop terminates. Thus, we have `0 <= x <= N+1` as the first loop invariant. For `y`, we can use the conditional statements in the loop to determine its range. If `x <= N`, then `y` is incremented, which means `y >= 1`. If `x >= N+1`, then `y` is decremented, which means `y <= x-N-1`. If `x == N`, then `y` is not modified, so the range of `y` stays the same. Thus, we have `-1 <= y <= x-N-1` as the second loop invariant.\n- After the loop termination, we need to check if the post-condition is satisfied. If `N < 0`, then the loop does not execute and the post-condition is trivially satisfied. If `N >= 0`, then we need to check if `y == -1` and `x >= 2*N+3`. Thus, we have the following loop invariant after the loop termination: `N >= 0 ==> y == -1 ==> x >= 2*N+3`. We use an implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. If `y` is non-deterministic at the end of the loop, we can again use an implication to make the invariant trivially true. Thus, we have `(N >= 0 && y >= -1) ==> y == -1 ==> x >= 2*N+3` as the final loop invariant. \n\nPutting it all together, we have the following loop invariants for the while loop:\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant 0 <= x <= N+1;\n  loop invariant -1 <= y <= x-N-1;\n  loop invariant (N < 0) || ((N >= 0 && y >= -1) ==> y == -1 ==> x >= 2*N+3);\n*/\n```",
