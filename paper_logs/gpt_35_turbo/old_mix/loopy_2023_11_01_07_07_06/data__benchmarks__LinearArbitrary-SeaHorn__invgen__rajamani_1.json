            "Pre-conditions or variable assignments:\n- Four integer variables `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` are initialized to 0.\n\nLoop condition:\n- The loop will execute as long as the function `unknown()` returns a non-zero value.\n\nLoop invariants:\n- `0 <= x <= w+4`\n- `0 <= w`\n- `0 <= z`\n- `y <= 100*w + 100`\n- If `x >= 4`, then `y > 2`\n\nExplanation:\n- `0 <= x <= w+4`: The variable `x` is incremented only when `unknown()` returns a non-zero value in the first `if` condition. Therefore, `x` is incremented at most once in every iteration of the loop. Hence, the maximum value of `x` that can be reached is `w+4`. Also, `x` is initialized to 0. Therefore, `0 <= x` always holds.\n- `0 <= w`: The variable `w` is incremented by 1 in every iteration of the loop. Therefore, `w` is always non-negative.\n- `0 <= z`: The variable `z` is incremented by 10 in every iteration of the loop. Therefore, `z` is always non-negative.\n- `y <= 100*w + 100`: The variable `y` is incremented by 100 in the first `if` condition. Therefore, `y` can be at most `100*w + 100`. Also, `y` is initialized to 0. Therefore, `y <= 100*w + 100` always holds.\n- If `x >= 4`, then `y > 2`: The assertion `y > 2` is guarded by the condition `x >= 4`. Therefore, we need to add this condition to the loop invariant. If `x >= 4` holds, then `x` is incremented by 1 and `y` is incremented by 1 in the second `if` condition. Therefore, `y` is at least 1 if `x >= 4`. Also, `y` is incremented by 100 in the first `if` condition if `unknown()` returns a non-zero value. Therefore, `y` is at least 101 if `x >= 4` and `unknown()` always returns a non-zero value. Hence, if `x >= 4`, then `y` is at least 101. Combining these two conditions, we get `x >= 4 ==> y > 2`. \n\nPutting it all together:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= x <= w+4;\n    loop invariant 0 <= w;\n    loop invariant 0 <= z;\n    loop invariant y <= 100*w + 100;\n    loop invariant x < 4 ==> y <= 2;\n    loop invariant x >= 4 ==> y > 2;\n*/\n```",

This is true because x is incremented by at least 1 in each iteration of the loop, and w is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. Thus, x can never exceed w+4.\n- The second invariant ensures that z is always between 0 and 10*w+10 (inclusive). This is true because z is incremented by 10 in each iteration of the loop, and w is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. Thus, z can never exceed 10*w+10.\n- The third invariant ensures that y is always equal to 100*x if x is less than or equal to 4. This is true because y is incremented by 100 in each iteration of the loop when the first condition is true, and x is incremented by 1. Thus, y is always a multiple of 100 when x is less than or equal to 4.\n- The fourth invariant ensures that y is always greater than or equal to 100*(x-4) and less than or equal to 100*(x-4) + w + 4 if x is greater than 4. This is true because y is incremented by 100 in each iteration of the loop when the first condition is true and x is greater than 4, and x is incremented by at least 1 in each iteration of the loop. Thus, y is always greater than or equal to 100*(x-4) and less than or equal to 100*(x-4) + w + 4.\n- The fifth invariant ensures that if y is less than or equal to 10*w, then z is less than or equal to 100*x. This is true because the condition `y > 10*w` is false, so the implication is trivially true.\n- The sixth invariant ensures that if y is greater than 10*w, then z is greater than or equal to 100*x + 100. This is true because the condition `y > 10*w` is true, so the implication is trivially true.\n- The seventh invariant ensures that w is always greater than or equal to 0. This is true because w is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, starting from 0. Thus, w is always greater than or equal to 0.\n\nUsing these loop invariants, we can verify that the post-condition `y > 2` holds after the loop termination if `x >= 4`. This is because if `x >= 4`, then `y` is at least `100*(x-4)` and `w` is at least `x-4`, by the fourth invariant. Therefore, `y` is at least `100*(x-4) + x-4 + 4 = 101*x - 400`, which is greater than 2 if `x >= 4`.",

This is true because x is incremented by at least 1 in each iteration of the loop, and w is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. Thus, x can never exceed w+4.\n- The second invariant ensures that z is always between 0 and 10*w+10 (inclusive). This is true because z is incremented by 10 in each iteration of the loop, and w is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. Thus, z can never exceed 10*w+10.\n- The third invariant ensures that y is always equal to 100*x if x is less than or equal to 4. This is true because y is incremented by 100 in each iteration of the loop when the first condition is true, and x is incremented by 1. Thus, y is always a multiple of 100 when x is less than or equal to 4.\n- The fourth invariant ensures that y is always greater than or equal to 100*(x-4) and less than or equal to 100*(x-4) + w + 4 if x is greater than 4. This is true because y is incremented by 100 in each iteration of the loop when the first condition is true and x is greater than 4, and x is incremented by at least 1 in each iteration of the loop. Thus, y is always greater than or equal to 100*(x-4) and less than or equal to 100*(x-4) + w + 4.\n- The fifth invariant ensures that if y is less than or equal to 10*w, then z is less than or equal to 100*x. This is true because the condition `y > 10*w` is false, so the implication is trivially true.\n- The sixth invariant ensures that if y is greater than 10*w, then z is greater than or equal to 100*x + 100. This is true because the condition `y > 10*w` is true, so the implication is trivially true.\n- The seventh invariant ensures that w is always greater than or equal to 0. This is true because w is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, starting from 0. Thus, w is always greater than or equal to 0.\n\nUsing these loop invariants, we can verify that the post-condition `y > 2` holds after the loop termination if `x >= 4`. This is because if `x >= 4`, then `y` is at least `100*(x-4)` and `w` is at least `x-4`, by the fourth invariant. Therefore, `y` is at least `100*(x-4) + x-4 + 4 = 101*x - 400`, which is greater than 2 if `x >= 4`.",
