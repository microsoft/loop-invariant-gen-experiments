            "First, let's note the preconditions and variable assignments:\n\n- The macro `assume(e)` is defined to return 0 if `!(e)` is true.\n- The constant `LARGE_INT` is defined as 1000000.\n- The variable `lo` is initialized to 0.\n- The variable `mid` is assigned a non-deterministic value using the function `unknown_int()`. The value of `mid` is assumed to be greater than 0 and less than or equal to `LARGE_INT`.\n- The variable `hi` is assigned the value `2*mid`.\n\nNext, let's analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition:\n```\nwhile (mid > 0) {\n    lo = lo + 1;\n    hi = hi - 1;\n    mid = mid - 1;\n}\n```\nThe loop condition is `mid > 0`.\n\nNow, let's find the loop invariants:\n\n- `mid > 0`\n- `lo >= 0`\n- `hi <= 2 * mid`\n- `(lo + hi) == 2 * mid`\n- `mid <= LARGE_INT`\n- `mid >= 0`\n\nLet's prove that these loop invariants hold:\n\n- Before the loop execution, `mid` is assigned a value greater than 0 and less than or equal to `LARGE_INT`, so `mid > 0` holds.\n- In every iteration of the loop, `mid` is decremented by 1, so `mid > 0` continues to hold.

However, from the loop invariant `(lo + hi) == 2 * mid`, we have that `lo` is equal to `hi`, which is the assertion that we are verifying.\n\nNote that we do not need to add any loop invariants to handle non-deterministic variables since there are none in this program. \n\nSo, the final loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant mid > 0;\n    loop invariant lo >= 0;\n    loop invariant hi <= 2 * mid;\n    loop invariant lo + hi == 2 * mid;\n    loop invariant mid <= LARGE_INT;\n    loop invariant mid >= 0;\n*/\n```\n",

The loop body increments `lo`, decrements `hi` and decrements `mid`.\n\nNow, let's look at the pre-conditions and variable assignments in the program:\n- `lo`, `mid`, and `hi` are initialized.\n- `mid` is assumed to be between 1 and `LARGE_INT`.\n- `unknown_int` is a non-deterministic function, but we can assume that it returns an integer between 1 and `LARGE_INT`.\n\nNext, we can try to find loop invariants that hold true before, during, and after the loop execution, and imply the post-condition `lo == hi`.\n\nBefore the loop:\n- `lo >= 0`\n- `hi <= 2*mid`\n- `mid > 0 && mid <= LARGE_INT`\n- `lo + mid + hi == 3*mid`\n\nDuring the loop:\n- `lo + hi == 2*mid`\n\nAfter the loop:\n- `lo == hi`\n\nPutting all the loop invariants together:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant lo >= 0;\n    loop invariant hi <= 2*mid;\n    loop invariant mid > 0 && mid <= LARGE_INT;\n    loop invariant lo + mid + hi == 3*mid;\n    loop invariant (mid > 0) ==> (lo + hi == 2*mid);\n    loop invariant lo == hi;\n*/\n```\nNote that we used implication to take care of the conditional nature of the loop. Also, we added conjunctions that bound the maximum and minimum values that variables can take.
