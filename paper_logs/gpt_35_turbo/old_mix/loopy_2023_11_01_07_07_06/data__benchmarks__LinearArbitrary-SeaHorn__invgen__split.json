This means that the loop iterates `2*k` times. \n\nGiven these observations, we can come up with the following loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= i <= n/2;\n    loop invariant 0 <= j <= n/2;\n    loop invariant (n%2 == 0 ==> i == j) && (n%2 == 1 ==> i == j+1);\n*/\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The first two loop invariants specify that `i` and `j` are always non-negative and less than or equal to `n/2`.\n- The third loop invariant specifies that if `n` is even, then `i` and `j` must be equal, and if `n` is odd, then `i` must be equal to `j+1`. This is because in each iteration, either `i` or `j` is incremented by 1, and `n` is even, so they must end up with the same value. If `n` is odd, then there is one extra iteration where `i` gets incremented but `j` does not, so `i` must be one more than `j`.\n\nFinally, we can use the loop invariants to prove the post-condition `i == j` as follows:\n```\ni == j        (by loop invariant)\nn%2 == 0 ==> i == j   (by loop invariant)\nn%2 == 1 ==> i == j+1 (by loop invariant)\n(n%2 == 0 || n%2 == 1) ==> i == j  (combine the above implications)\ntrue ==> i == j    (since n%2 is always either 0 or 1)\n```\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants imply the post-condition, and the program is correct.",
