Given a program, you can find loop invariants, which can then be used to verify some property in the program. \nFrama-C is a software verification tool for C programs. The input to Frama-C is a C program file with ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations.\nFor the given program, find the necessary loop invariants of the while loop to help Frama-C verify the post-condition.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. \n- Output loop invariants that are true \n(i) before the loop execution, \n(ii) in every iteration of the loop and \n(iii) after the loop termination, \nsuch that the loop invariants imply the post condition.\n- If a loop invariant is a conjunction, split it into its parts.\n- Output all the loop invariants in one code block. For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values.

This can be expressed as: `0 <= x <= 6`.\n- The value of y is equal to 2 to the power of x at the beginning of each iteration of the loop.

This can be expressed as: `1 <= y <= 64`.\n- The value of x is between 1 and 6 (inclusive) at the end of each iteration of the loop. This can be expressed as: `1 <= x <= 6`.\n\nUsing these loop invariants, we can verify the post-condition that `y` is not equal to `64` at the end of the loop. We can express this as an implication: \n- If `y` equals `64` at the end of the loop, then `x` must also equal `6`. This is because `y` is equal to `2^x`, and the only power of 2 between 1 and 64 is 2^6. Therefore, we can write the implication as: `(y == 64) ==> (x == 6)`.\n\nPutting all of this together, we get the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= x <= 6;\n    loop invariant y == pow(2, x);\n    loop invariant 1 <= y <= 64;\n    loop invariant 1 <= x <= 6;\n    loop invariant (y == 64) ==> (x == 6);\n*/\n```\nNote that we used the `pow()` function from the standard library to express the invariant that `y` is equal to `2^x`.",

This is because in each iteration of the loop, `y` is multiplied by 2, and `x` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `y` is always equal to `2` raised to the power of the number of times the loop has been executed (which is equal to the current value of `x`). \n\nPost-condition:\n- `y != 64`\n\nSince the loop invariant `y == pow(2, x)` holds true after the loop termination, we can use it to prove the post-condition.
