The input to Frama-C is a C program file with ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations.\nFor the given program, find the necessary loop invariants of the while loop to help Frama-C verify the post-condition.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. \n- Output loop invariants that are true \n(i) before the loop execution, \n(ii) in every iteration of the loop and \n(iii) after the loop termination, \nsuch that the loop invariants imply the post condition.\n- If a loop invariant is a conjunction, split it into its parts.\n- Output all the loop invariants in one code block.

Therefore, we can assume that `y` is non-negative before the loop execution.\n- In every iteration:\n    - The loop condition is that `x` is less than 99. Therefore, `x` is always less than or equal to 99 within the loop.\n    - If `y` is even, then `y % 2` is 0, and from the assertion, we have `(x % 2) == 0`. Therefore, `x` is even, and its value is greater than or equal to its previous value by 2. This is because, if `x` was even in the previous iteration, then `x` is incremented by 2 to get the new value. If `x` was odd in the previous iteration, then `x` is incremented by 1 to become even, and then incremented by 1 again to get the new value. In either case, `x` is greater than or equal to its previous value by 2.\n    - If `y` is odd, then `y % 2` is 1, and from the assertion, we have `(x % 2) == 1`. Therefore, `x` is odd, and its value is greater than its previous value by 1. This is because, if `x` was even in the previous iteration, then `x` is incremented by 2 to become odd. If `x` was odd in the previous iteration, then `x` is incremented by 1 to get the new value, which is odd.\n- After the loop termination:\n    - From the loop condition, we know that `x` is greater than or equal to 99.\n    - From the assertion, we have `(x % 2) == (y % 2)`.\n    - `y` is not modified in the loop, so its value is the same as it was before the loop termination. Therefore, `y % 2` is non-negative and has the same parity as `y`.\n    - If `x` is even, then `x % 2` is 0, and from the assertion, we have `y % 2 == 0`. Therefore, `y` is even and has the same parity as `x`.\n    - If `x` is odd, then `x % 2` is 1, and from the assertion, we have `y % 2 == 1`. Therefore, `y` is odd and has the same parity as `x`.\n    - Therefore, `(x % 2) == (y % 2)` holds after the loop termination.\n    - `y` is non-negative, as mentioned in the loop body.",

This is because the condition inside the loop checks whether `y` is even or odd, and then increments `x` accordingly.
