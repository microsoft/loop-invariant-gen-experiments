            "First, let's note the pre-conditions and variable assignments in the program:\n\nPre-conditions:\n- None\n\nVariable Assignments:\n- `a` is assigned the value `2`\n- `SIZE` is assigned the value `8`\n- `i` is declared and initialized to `0`\n- `sn` is declared and initialized to `0`\n\nNext, let's analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. The loop condition is `i<=SIZE`.\n\nNow, let's output the necessary loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 1 <= i <= SIZE+1;\n    loop invariant 0 <= sn <= (i-1)/3*a;\n    loop invariant (i <= 4) ==> (sn <= i*a);\n    loop invariant (sn == SIZE*a) || (sn == 0);\n*/\n```\nExplanation:\n- The first loop invariant ensures that `i` stays within the bounds of `1` and `SIZE+1`.\n- The second loop invariant ensures that `sn` stays within the bounds of `0` and `(i-1)/3*a`. Since `i` increments by `1` in every iteration, the maximum value that `(i-1)/3` can take is `2`, hence the maximum value of `sn` is `2*a` in every iteration.\n- The third loop invariant says that if `i` is less than or equal to `4`, then `sn` must be less than or equal to `i*a`. This is because the loop only adds `a` to `sn` when `i` is less than `4`.\n- The fourth loop invariant says that `sn` must either be equal to `SIZE*a` or `0` after the loop terminates, which is the same as the post-condition. \n\nNote that we used implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code in the third loop invariant. We also used an implication to make the second loop invariant trivially true at the beginning of the loop since `i` is non-deterministic at the beginning.",

If `i` is less than or equal to 4, then `sn` should be equal to `(i-1)*a`.\n5. If `i` is greater than 4, then `sn` should be equal to `3*a*(i-4) + 4*a`.\n6. The sum `sn` should be between `(i-1)*a` and `3*a*(i-4) + 4*a`.\n7.
