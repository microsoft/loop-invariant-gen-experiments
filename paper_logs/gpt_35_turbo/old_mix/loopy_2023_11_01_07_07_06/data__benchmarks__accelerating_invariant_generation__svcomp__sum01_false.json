            "First, let's analyze the program. The program initializes an integer variable `n` with a non-deterministic value, and a variable `sn` with 0. Then, it enters a for loop from `i=1` to `n`. Inside the loop, it checks if `i` is less than 10. If `i` is less than 10, it adds the value of the macro `a` to `sn`. Finally, outside the loop, it checks if `sn` is equal to `n*a` or if it is equal to 0.\n\nTo find the loop invariants, let's consider the pre-conditions and variable assignments in the program:\n- The macro `a` is defined as 2.\n- The variable `n` is initialized with a non-deterministic value.\n- The variable `sn` is initialized with 0.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition:\n- The loop condition is `i<=n`.\n\nBased on the program analysis, we can output the loop invariants for the loop as follows:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant 1 <= i <= n+1;\n    loop invariant sn == (\\sum integer j; 1 <= j < i ==> (j<10 ? a : 0));\n    loop invariant sn <= i*a;\n    loop invariant sn == 0 || sn >= a;\n    loop invariant (n<=0) ==> (sn==0);\n    loop invariant ((sn!=0) && (i>n)) ==> (sn==n*a);\n*/\n```\n\nExplanation of the loop invariants:\n- The first loop invariant `1 <= i <= n+1` ensures that the loop index `i` is always within the bounds of the loop.\n- The second loop invariant `sn == (\\sum integer j; 1 <= j < i ==> (j<10 ? a : 0))` calculates the sum of `a` for all values of `i` less than 10 and 0 for all other values of `i`.\n- The third loop invariant `sn <= i*a` ensures that `sn` is always less than or equal to `i*a`.\n- The fourth loop invariant `sn == 0 || sn >= a` ensures that `sn` is either 0 or greater than or equal to `a`.\n- The fifth loop invariant `(n<=0) ==> (sn==0)` handles the case when `n` is less than or equal to 0, in which case `sn` must be 0.\n- The sixth loop invariant `((sn!=0) && (i>n)) ==> (sn==n*a)` handles the case when the loop has terminated and `sn` is not 0, in which case `sn` must be equal to `n*a`.",
