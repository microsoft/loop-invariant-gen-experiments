The input to Frama-C is a C program file with ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations.\nFor the given program, find the necessary loop invariants of the while loop to help Frama-C verify the post-condition.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. \n- Output loop invariants that are true \n(i) before the loop execution, \n(ii) in every iteration of the loop and \n(iii) after the loop termination, \nsuch that the loop invariants imply the post condition.\n- If a loop invariant is a conjunction, split it into its parts.\n- Output all the loop invariants in one code block. For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values.

            "The pre-condition of the program is that variable `x` is uninitialized and contains garbage value.\n\nThe loop condition is `x < 0x0fffffff`.\n\nThe post-condition of the program is that `x` is greater than or equal to `0x0fffffff`.\n\nTo verify the post-condition, we need to find loop invariants that are true before, during, and after the loop execution. Let's analyze the loop body.\n\nThe loop body increments `x` by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, a possible loop invariant is `x >= \\old(x)`. This is true before and during the loop execution because `x` is uninitialized and has a garbage value at the beginning, but is updated to a larger value in each iteration.\n\nHowever, this loop invariant is not sufficient to prove the post-condition, because it does not take into account the loop condition. We need to find a loop invariant that implies that `x` will eventually reach `0x0fffffff`.\n\nSince the loop condition is `x < 0x0fffffff`, a possible loop invariant is `x <= 0x0fffffff`. This is true before the loop execution because `x` is uninitialized and has a garbage value, which is less than or equal to `0x0fffffff`. This is also true during the loop execution, because the loop condition ensures that `x` is always less than `0x0fffffff`.\n\nTo prove the post-condition, we need to show that the loop invariant `x <= 0x0fffffff` implies that `x >= 0x0fffffff`. This is true because `x` is incremented in each iteration of the loop, and eventually reaches `0x0fffffff` due to the loop condition. Therefore, the loop invariant `x <= 0x0fffffff` implies the post-condition `x >= 0x0fffffff`.\n\nPutting these together, the loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= \\old(x);\n    loop invariant x <= 0x0fffffff;\n*/\n```\nNote that the first loop invariant is true before and during the loop execution, while the second loop invariant is true before, during, and after the loop execution.",
