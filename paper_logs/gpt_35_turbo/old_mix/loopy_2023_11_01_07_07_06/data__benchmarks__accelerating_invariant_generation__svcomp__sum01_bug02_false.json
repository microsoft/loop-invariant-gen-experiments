The input to Frama-C is a C program file with ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations.\nFor the given program, find the necessary loop invariants of the while loop to help Frama-C verify the post-condition.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. \n- Output loop invariants that are true \n(i) before the loop execution, \n(ii) in every iteration of the loop and \n(iii) after the loop termination, \nsuch that the loop invariants imply the post condition.\n- If a loop invariant is a conjunction, split it into its parts.\n- Output all the loop invariants in one code block. For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values.

This is true before the loop starts because `i` is initialized to 1 and the loop condition ensures that `i` is less than or equal to `n`. It is also true at the end of each iteration because `i` is incremented by 1 each time.\n- The second loop invariant states that `j` is always between 10 and `10-n`. This is true before the loop starts because `j` is initialized to 10 and the loop condition ensures that `i` is less than or equal to `n`. It is also true at the end of each iteration because `j` is decremented by 1 each time.\n- The third loop invariant is a bit more complicated. It states that `sn` is equal to `(i-1)*a - (i-1-j)*a` or 0. This is true before the loop starts because `sn` is initialized to 0. It is also true at the end of each iteration because `sn` is updated by adding `a` if `i` is less than `j`. We can simplify `(i-1)*a - (i-1-j)*a` to `j*a`, so the loop invariant can be written as `sn == j*a || sn == 0`. This implies the post-condition because if `sn` is equal to `j*a`, then `j` must be equal to `n`, and therefore `sn` is equal to `n*a`. If `sn` is equal to 0, then `j` must be less than or equal to `n-1`, and therefore `i` must be equal to `n+1`, which satisfies the loop condition and terminates the loop.",

This is true because `sn` is updated only if `i` is less than `j`, and in that case, `sn` is incremented by `a`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the value of `sn` at the beginning of the next iteration is `(i-1)*a`.\n- The fourth invariant states that if `i` is less than or equal to `j+1`, then `sn` is equal to `(n-j)*a`. This is true because if `i` is less than or equal to `j+1`, then for all subsequent iterations of the loop, `i` will be less than or equal to `j`. Therefore, `sn` will be incremented by `a` for each iteration, until `j` reaches `n-1`. At this point, `i` will be equal to `n+1`, and the loop will terminate.
