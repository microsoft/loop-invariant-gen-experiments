Given a program, you can find loop invariants, which can then be used to verify some property in the program. \nFrama-C is a software verification tool for C programs. The input to Frama-C is a C program file with ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations.\nFor the given program, find the necessary loop invariants of the while loop to help Frama-C verify the post-condition.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. \n- Output loop invariants that are true \n(i) before the loop execution, \n(ii) in every iteration of the loop and \n(iii) after the loop termination, \nsuch that the loop invariants imply the post condition.\n- If a loop invariant is a conjunction, split it into its parts.\n- Output all the loop invariants in one code block. For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values.

We can use implication to incorporate this condition:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant (x > 0 ==> x % 2 == 0);\n    loop invariant (x <= 0 ==> x % 2 == 0);\n*/\n```\nNote that the third loop invariant is equivalent to the post-condition. Also, since the loop terminates when `x` becomes non-positive, we can use implication to make the second loop invariant trivially true at the end of the loop:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant (x > 0 ==> x % 2 == 0);\n    loop invariant (x <= 0 ==> x % 2 == 0);\n    loop variant x;\n*/\n```",

Hence, it will always be an even number.\n- Also, since `x` is an unsigned integer, it cannot take negative values.

If x is even before the iteration, then it will still be even after the iteration.
