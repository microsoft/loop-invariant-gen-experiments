This means that `term` is multiplied by `x^(2)` and then by `x^(2)/3`, and so on. Therefore, `term` is less than or equal to `x^(count/2) / (count/2)!`.\n- `term >= 0` is true because `x` is positive and `count` is positive, so `x/count` is positive, which means that `term` is always positive.\n- `count % 2 == 0 ==> evenExp = 1.0 + sum(i=1 to count/2) ( (-1)^(i+1) * (x^(2i) / (2i)!) )` is true because if `count` is even, then `multFactor` is 1, which means that `evenExp` is updated, and if `count` is odd, then `evenExp` is not updated. The formula on the right-hand side of the implication is the sum of the even terms in the Taylor series for `cos(x)`.\n- `count % 2 == 1 ==> oddExp = x + sum(i=1 to (count-1)/2) ( (-1)^i * (x^(2i+1) / (2i+1)!) )` is true because if `count` is odd, then `multFactor` is -1, which means that `oddExp` is updated, and if `count` is even, then `oddExp` is not updated. The formula on the right-hand side of the implication is the sum of the odd terms in the Taylor series for `cos(x)`.\n- `multFactor = (-1)^(count/2)` is true because if `count` is even, then `multFactor` is 1, and if `count` is odd, then `multFactor` is -1.\n- `count > 1 ==> oddExp >= evenExp` is true because `oddExp` is initially assigned the value of `x`, which is greater than or equal to `evenExp` (which is initially 1.0), and in each iteration of the loop, `oddExp` and `evenExp` are updated in such a way that `oddExp` is always greater than or equal to `evenExp`. \n\nNote:\n- Since `unknown_float()` and `unknown_int()` are non-deterministic functions whose definitions are not given, we cannot make any assumptions about their return values. Therefore, we cannot add any loop invariants that depend on these functions. However, we can use the fact that `temp"

Therefore, the invariants `oddExp >= x` and `evenExp >= 1.0` hold before the loop.\n\nMaintenance:\n- At the end of each iteration, `oddExp` and `evenExp` are updated with the new value of `term`. Since `term >= 0`, it follows that `oddExp` and `evenExp` can only increase. Therefore, the invariants `oddExp >= x` and `evenExp >= 1.0` hold in every iteration of the loop.\n- The variables `count` and `multFactor` are updated in each iteration of the loop. Since `count` starts at 2 and is incremented by 2 in each iteration, it is always an even number. Therefore, `count >> 1 % 2 == 0` is always true, and `multFactor` is always either 1 or -1. Therefore, the invariant `multFactor == 1 || multFactor == -1` holds in every iteration of the loop.\n- The variable `term` is updated twice in each iteration of the loop. The first update is `term = term * (x / count);`, and the second update is `term = term * (x / (count + 1));`. Therefore, we have `term * (x / count) * (x / (count + 1)) == term * (x^2 / (count * (count + 1)));`. Using this relation, we can derive the invariant `term * ((count + 1) / (count + 2)) * ((count + 3) / (count + 4)) * ... * ((count + n - 1) / count) == term * (x^2 / (count * (count + 2)) * (x^2 / (count + 4) * ... * (x^2 / (count + n - 2)))` where `n` is the number of iterations performed so far.\n\nTermination:\n- The loop terminates when `temp == 0`. If `temp == 0`, then the implication in the assertion is trivially true. Therefore, the invariant `temp == 0 ==> oddExp >= evenExp` holds after the loop.\n- Since the loop runs indefinitely, there is no other post-condition that can be verified."

If `count` is even, then `evenExp` is updated, and if `count` is odd, then `oddExp` is updated. Therefore, if `count` is even, then `evenExp` is greater than or equal to `oddExp`, i.e., `count % 2 == 0 ==> evenExp >= oddExp`. Similarly, if `count` is odd, then `oddExp` is greater than or equal to `evenExp`, i.e., `count % 2 == 1 ==> oddExp >= evenExp`.\n- The value of `term` is updated in each iteration by multiplying it with `(x/count)` twice. Therefore, the maximum value of `term` occurs when `count` is `2`, and its value is `x * octant / (2 * (2-1))`, i.e., `term <= x * octant / (count * (count-1))`.\n- `count` is initialized to `2`, and it is incremented by `1` in each iteration. Therefore, `count` is always greater than or equal to `2`, i.e., `count >= 2`.\n- The assertion `oddExp >= evenExp` is guarded by the condition `temp == 0`, which means that if the loop terminates because `temp` is `0`, then the assertion does not need to hold. Therefore, we use an implication to make the invariant trivially true if `temp` is non-zero, i.e., `(temp != 0) ==> (oddExp >= evenExp)`."

Therefore, the invariants `oddExp >= x` and `evenExp >= 1.0` hold before the loop.\n\nMaintenance:\n- At the end of each iteration, `oddExp` and `evenExp` are updated with the new value of `term`. Since `term >= 0`, it follows that `oddExp` and `evenExp` can only increase. Therefore, the invariants `oddExp >= x` and `evenExp >= 1.0` hold in every iteration of the loop.\n- The variables `count` and `multFactor` are updated in each iteration of the loop. Since `count` starts at 2 and is incremented by 2 in each iteration, it is always an even number. Therefore, `count >> 1 % 2 == 0` is always true, and `multFactor` is always either 1 or -1. Therefore, the invariant `multFactor == 1 || multFactor == -1` holds in every iteration of the loop.\n- The variable `term` is updated twice in each iteration of the loop. The first update is `term = term * (x / count);`, and the second update is `term = term * (x / (count + 1));`. Therefore, we have `term * (x / count) * (x / (count + 1)) == term * (x^2 / (count * (count + 1)));`. Using this relation, we can derive the invariant `term * ((count + 1) / (count + 2)) * ((count + 3) / (count + 4)) * ... * ((count + n - 1) / count) == term * (x^2 / (count * (count + 2)) * (x^2 / (count + 4) * ... * (x^2 / (count + n - 2)))` where `n` is the number of iterations performed so far.\n\nTermination:\n- The loop terminates when `temp == 0`. If `temp == 0`, then the implication in the assertion is trivially true. Therefore, the invariant `temp == 0 ==> oddExp >= evenExp` holds after the loop.\n- Since the loop runs indefinitely, there is no other post-condition that can be verified."

If `count` is even, then `evenExp` is updated, and if `count` is odd, then `oddExp` is updated. Therefore, if `count` is even, then `evenExp` is greater than or equal to `oddExp`, i.e., `count % 2 == 0 ==> evenExp >= oddExp`. Similarly, if `count` is odd, then `oddExp` is greater than or equal to `evenExp`, i.e., `count % 2 == 1 ==> oddExp >= evenExp`.\n- The value of `term` is updated in each iteration by multiplying it with `(x/count)` twice. Therefore, the maximum value of `term` occurs when `count` is `2`, and its value is `x * octant / (2 * (2-1))`, i.e., `term <= x * octant / (count * (count-1))`.\n- `count` is initialized to `2`, and it is incremented by `1` in each iteration. Therefore, `count` is always greater than or equal to `2`, i.e., `count >= 2`.\n- The assertion `oddExp >= evenExp` is guarded by the condition `temp == 0`, which means that if the loop terminates because `temp` is `0`, then the assertion does not need to hold. Therefore, we use an implication to make the invariant trivially true if `temp` is non-zero, i.e., `(temp != 0) ==> (oddExp >= evenExp)`."

Therefore, `s == 0 && i == 0`. `n` is an unsigned char and hence can take values between 1 and 255, inclusive. Therefore, `1 <= n <= 255`.\n- In every iteration of the loop: `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration and hence `1 <= i <= n`. `v` is assigned a value returned by `unknown_uchar()` in each iteration and hence can take values between 0 and 255, inclusive. Therefore, `0 <= v <= 255`. `s` is incremented by `v` in each iteration and hence `0 <= s <= 65025`.\n- After the loop termination: The loop terminates when `i` becomes equal to `n`. Therefore, `i == n`. `s` is the sum of `n` values returned by `unknown_uchar()` and hence `s` can take values between 0 and 255*255=65025, inclusive. Therefore, `s <= 65025`. If `s < v`, then the assertion fails. Hence, `s < v` implies the assertion is false. Similarly, if `s > 65025`, then the assertion fails. Hence, `s > 65025` implies the assertion is false. \n\nNote:\n- Since `unknown_uchar()` is non-deterministic, we cannot make any assumptions about the values returned by it. Hence, we cannot bound the maximum and minimum values that `v` and `s` can take. \n- Since `n` is assigned a value returned by `unknown_uchar()`, we cannot make any assumptions about the value of `n`."

Therefore, `count >= 2` is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n- `term` is assigned the value of `x` before the loop execution. In each iteration, `term` is multiplied by `(x/count)` twice. Therefore, `term == (pow(-1, (count-2)/2) * pow(x, count-2)) / fact(count-2)` is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n- `evenExp` and `oddExp` are assigned the values of `1.0` and `x`, respectively, before the loop execution. In each iteration, `term` is multiplied by `(x/count)` twice. `evenExp` and `oddExp` are updated using `term` in different ways depending on the parity of `count`. Therefore, `evenExp == 1 + (term * sigma i=1 to floor(count/2) : pow(-1,i+1) * pow(x,2*i) / fact(2*i))` and `oddExp == x + (term * sigma i=1 to floor((count-1)/2) : pow(-1,i+1) * pow(x,2*i+1) / fact(2*i+1))` are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n- `multFactor` depends on the parity of `count`. If `count` is even, then `multFactor` is `1`, otherwise it is `-1`. Therefore, `multFactor == pow(-1,floor(count/2))` is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n- If `count` is even, then `evenExp` is updated with `term`, otherwise `oddExp` is updated with `term`. Therefore, if `count%2 == 0`, then `evenExp >= oddExp`, and if `count%2 == 1`, then `evenExp <= oddExp`. Therefore, `count%2 == 0 ==> (evenExp >= oddExp)` and `count%2 == 1 ==> (evenExp <= oddExp)` are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n- The assertion is guarded by `temp == 0`. Therefore, if `temp` is non-zero, then the assertion does not need to be true. Therefore, `temp == 0 ==> (evenExp >= oddExp)` is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination."

This is true before the loop execution because `count` is initialized to `2` and `term` is assigned the value of `x`. In every iteration of the loop, `term` is updated to the product of `term` and `x/count` twice. Therefore, the invariant holds true in every iteration of the loop. After the loop termination, `term` is equal to the product of `x/(count-1)` and all numbers from `count-1` down to `2`, where `count` is the value of `count` in the last iteration of the loop. Therefore, the invariant holds true after the loop termination.\n- The second invariant states that `oddExp` is always equal to the sum of `x` raised to the odd powers and `evenExp` is always equal to the sum of `x` raised to the even powers. This is true before the loop execution because `oddExp` is assigned the value of `x` and `evenExp` is assigned the value `1.0`. In every iteration of the loop, `evenExp` and `oddExp` are updated based on the value of `multFactor` and `term`. Since `multFactor` is updated based on the value of `count`, which is even, `evenExp` is updated with the current value of `term`. Similarly, since `multFactor` is updated based on the value of `count`, which is odd, `oddExp` is updated with the current value of `term`. Therefore, the invariants hold true in every iteration of the loop. After the loop termination, `evenExp` is greater than or equal to `oddExp` as per the assertion. Therefore, the invariants hold true after the loop termination.\n- The third invariant states that `evenExp >= oddExp` for every iteration of the loop. This is true because `evenExp` is updated with the current value of `term` only when `count` is even and `oddExp` is updated with the current value of `term` only when `count` is odd. Since `count` is incremented by `2` in every iteration of the loop, the parity of `count` alternates between even and odd.

We want to verify that `evenExp` is greater than or equal to `oddExp` when the loop terminates. Therefore, this needs to be an invariant of the loop.\n- `count > 1`: This is true before the loop starts because `count` is assigned the value of 2 before the loop.

It is also true after the loop terminates because the loop runs infinitely and `count` keeps getting incremented by 2.\n- `term >= 0`: This is true before the loop starts because `term` is assigned the value of `x` before the loop.

This is true before the loop execution because `count` is initialized to `2` and `term` is assigned the value of `x`. In every iteration of the loop, `term` is updated to the product of `term` and `x/count` twice. Therefore, the invariant holds true in every iteration of the loop. After the loop termination, `term` is equal to the product of `x/(count-1)` and all numbers from `count-1` down to `2`, where `count` is the value of `count` in the last iteration of the loop. Therefore, the invariant holds true after the loop termination.\n- The second invariant states that `oddExp` is always equal to the sum of `x` raised to the odd powers and `evenExp` is always equal to the sum of `x` raised to the even powers. This is true before the loop execution because `oddExp` is assigned the value of `x` and `evenExp` is assigned the value `1.0`. In every iteration of the loop, `evenExp` and `oddExp` are updated based on the value of `multFactor` and `term`. Since `multFactor` is updated based on the value of `count`, which is even, `evenExp` is updated with the current value of `term`. Similarly, since `multFactor` is updated based on the value of `count`, which is odd, `oddExp` is updated with the current value of `term`. Therefore, the invariants hold true in every iteration of the loop. After the loop termination, `evenExp` is greater than or equal to `oddExp` as per the assertion. Therefore, the invariants hold true after the loop termination.\n- The third invariant states that `evenExp >= oddExp` for every iteration of the loop. This is true because `evenExp` is updated with the current value of `term` only when `count` is even and `oddExp` is updated with the current value of `term` only when `count` is odd. Since `count` is incremented by `2` in every iteration of the loop, the parity of `count` alternates between even and odd. Therefore, the invariant holds true in every iteration of the loop.\n- The fourth invariant states that `multFactor` is equal to `1` if"

We want to verify that `evenExp` is greater than or equal to `oddExp` when the loop terminates. Therefore, this needs to be an invariant of the loop.\n- `count > 1`: This is true before the loop starts because `count` is assigned the value of 2 before the loop.

It is also true after the loop terminates because the loop runs infinitely and `term` keeps getting multiplied by a positive number.\n- `multFactor == 1 || multFactor == -1`: This is true in every iteration of the loop because `multFactor` is assigned either 1 or -1 in each iteration.\n- `temp == 0 ==> evenExp >= oddExp`: This means that if `temp` is equal to 0, then the post-condition of the program is satisfied. This is true in every iteration of the loop because `temp` is assigned the value of `unknown_int()` in each iteration and we do not know anything about the value of `temp`.\n- `x > 0 ==> evenExp >= oddExp`: This means that if `x` is greater than 0, then the post-condition of the program is satisfied. This is true in every iteration of the loop because `x` is assigned the value of `unknown_float()` before the loop and we do not know anything about the value of `x`.\n- `octant2 > octant1 ==> evenExp >= oddExp`: This means that if `octant2` is greater than `octant1`, then the post-condition of the program is satisfied.

Additionally, if `a` is not 0 at the start of an iteration, then it will decrease by 1 at the end of the iteration, since the loop increments it by 1 and then checks the loop condition to see if it should continue. However, if `a` is 0 at the start of an iteration, it will remain 0 throughout the iteration, since the loop will not execute again.\n- After the loop termination, we note that the loop only terminates if `a` is no longer less than 6. Since `a` starts at 0 and increases by 1 after each iteration, the loop will execute exactly 6 times, and `a` will be 6 at the end of the loop. Therefore, the only way for the assertion to fail is if `a == 6` before the assertion. Thus, we can write the final loop invariant as `a == 6 ==> \\false`.

Thus, at the start of every iteration, `a` is between 0 and 5 inclusive, i.e., `0 <= a <= 5`. Additionally, if `a` is not 0 at the start of an iteration, then it will decrease by 1 at the end of the iteration, since the loop increments it by 1 and then checks the loop condition to see if it should continue. However, if `a` is 0 at the start of an iteration, it will remain 0 throughout the iteration, since the loop will not execute again.\n- After the loop termination, we note that the loop only terminates if `a` is no longer less than 6. Since `a` starts at 0 and increases by 1 after each iteration, the loop will execute exactly 6 times, and `a` will be 6 at the end of the loop. Therefore, the only way for the assertion to fail is if `a == 6` before the assertion. Thus, we can write the final loop invariant as `a == 6 ==> \\false`. This states that if `a` is 6 at the end of the loop, then the assertion will fail (since `a == 6` implies that the loop did not execute 6 times)."

It ensures that at any point in the loop, the sum of `a` and `b` is equal to either `2*i` (if `i` is even) or `i+2` (if `i` is odd). This can be proven by considering the two cases in the if-else statement.

This can be proven by splitting the loop into two cases: when the condition `unknown_int()` is true and when it is false. In the first case, `a` is incremented by 1 and `b` is incremented by 2, so the sum increases by 3. In the second case, `a` is incremented by 2 and `b` is incremented by 1, so the sum still increases by 3. Therefore, the sum is always equal to `3*i + 2*(n-i)`.\n- The fifth and sixth invariants state the relationship between `i`, `a`, and `b`. If `i` is even, then `a` should be equal to `i/2` and `b` should be equal to `(i+1)/2`. If `i` is odd, then `a` should be equal to `(i+1)/2` and `b` should be equal to `i/2`. These can be proven by induction on `i`. The base case is true, since when `i = 0`, both `a` and `b` are 0. For the induction step, assume the invariants hold for some `i`. If `i` is even, then in the next iteration `a` should be incremented by 1 and `b` should be incremented by 2, so the new values of `a` and `b` are `(i/2)+1` and `(i+1)/2+2`, respectively. This satisfies the invariants for `i+1`. If `i` is odd, then in the next iteration `a` should be incremented by 2 and `b` should be incremented by 1, so the new values of `a` and `b` are `(i+1)/2+2` and `i/2+1`, respectively. This also satisfies the invariants for `i+1`.\n- The seventh and eighth invariants state the relationship between `i`, `a`, `b`, and `n`. If `i` is even, then `b` should be equal to `n-a`. If `i` is odd, then `a` should be equal to `n-b`. These can be proven using the fifth and sixth invariants, along with the fact that `a+b = 3*i + 2*(n-i)`. If `i` is even, then `a = i/2` and `b = (i+1)/2`, so `a+b = i+1`. Solving the equations `a+b = i+1` and `a+n-b = 2*n-3*i-1`, we get `b = n-a`. If `i` is odd, then `a = (i+1)/2` and `b = i/2`, so `a+b = i+1`.

Also, `a` and `b` are initialized to 0.\n- In every iteration of the loop, if `i < n` then `a+b` is equal to `3*i`. This is because in each iteration, either `a` is incremented by 1 and `b` is incremented by 2, or `a` is incremented by 2 and `b` is incremented by 1. Thus, `a+b` is always equal to 3 times the number of iterations so far, which is `i`. Also, `a` and `b` are always non-negative, so `a >= 0` and `b >= 0`. Finally, since `a+b` is always equal to 3 times the number of iterations so far, it cannot exceed `3*n`, so `a+b <= 3*n`.\n- After the loop termination, `a+b` is equal to `3*n` because the loop has executed `n` times, and in each iteration, `a+b` was incremented by 3. Therefore, the sum of all increments is `3*n`.\n\nNote: Since `unknown_int()` is a non-deterministic function call, we cannot make any assumptions about its return value. However, we can use implication to make the loop invariants hold even if the values of `unknown_int()` are not known. For example, the loop invariant `(i < n) ==> ((a+b) = 3*i)` is always true, regardless of the value of `unknown_int()`, because the implication is vacuously true when `i >= n`. Similarly, the loop invariant `a+b <= 3*n` is always true, regardless of the value of `unknown_int()`, because it is an upper bound on the sum `a+b`."

In the second case, `a` is incremented by 2 and `b` is incremented by 1, so the sum still increases by 3. Therefore, the sum is always equal to `3*i + 2*(n-i)`.\n- The fifth and sixth invariants state the relationship between `i`, `a`, and `b`.

These can be proven by induction on `i`. The base case is true, since when `i = 0`, both `a` and `b` are 0. For the induction step, assume the invariants hold for some `i`. If `i` is even, then in the next iteration `a` should be incremented by 1 and `b` should be incremented by 2, so the new values of `a` and `b` are `(i/2)+1` and `(i+1)/2+2`, respectively. This satisfies the invariants for `i+1`. If `i` is odd, then in the next iteration `a` should be incremented by 2 and `b` should be incremented by 1, so the new values of `a` and `b` are `(i+1)/2+2` and `i/2+1`, respectively. This also satisfies the invariants for `i+1`.\n- The seventh and eighth invariants state the relationship between `i`, `a`, `b`, and `n`. If `i` is even, then `b` should be equal to `n-a`. If `i` is odd, then `a` should be equal to `n-b`. These can be proven using the fifth and sixth invariants, along with the fact that `a+b = 3*i + 2*(n-i)`. If `i` is even, then `a = i/2` and `b = (i+1)/2`, so `a+b = i+1`. Solving the equations `a+b = i+1` and `a+n-b = 2*n-3*i-1`, we get `b = n-a`. If `i` is odd, then `a = (i+1)/2` and `b = i/2`, so `a+b = i+1`.

Also, `a` and `b` are initialized to 0.\n- In every iteration of the loop, if `i < n` then `a+b` is equal to `3*i`. This is because in each iteration, either `a` is incremented by 1 and `b` is incremented by 2, or `a` is incremented by 2 and `b` is incremented by 1. Thus, `a+b` is always equal to 3 times the number of iterations so far, which is `i`. Also, `a` and `b` are always non-negative, so `a >= 0` and `b >= 0`. Finally, since `a+b` is always equal to 3 times the number of iterations so far, it cannot exceed `3*n`, so `a+b <= 3*n`.\n- After the loop termination, `a+b` is equal to `3*n` because the loop has executed `n` times, and in each iteration, `a+b` was incremented by 3. Therefore, the sum of all increments is `3*n`.\n\nNote: Since `unknown_int()` is a non-deterministic function call, we cannot make any assumptions about its return value. However, we can use implication to make the loop invariants hold even if the values of `unknown_int()` are not known. For example, the loop invariant `(i < n) ==> ((a+b) = 3*i)` is always true, regardless of the value of `unknown_int()`, because the implication is vacuously true when `i >= n`. Similarly, the loop invariant `a+b <= 3*n` is always true, regardless of the value of `unknown_int()`, because it is an upper bound on the sum `a+b`."

This gives us the loop invariant x <= 100.\n- Since x starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, we know that x will eventually be greater than or equal to 0 after the loop terminates. This gives us the loop invariant x >= 0.\n- Similarly, y starts at 50 and increments by 1 only when x is greater than or equal to 50. Since x is guaranteed to be less than or equal to 100 after the loop terminates, we know that y will eventually be less than or equal to 100. This gives us the loop invariant y <= 100.\n- Since y starts at 50 and only increments by 1, we know that y will eventually be greater than or equal to 50 after the loop terminates. This gives us the loop invariant y >= 50.\n- Since y only increments when x is greater than or equal to 50, we know that x is always less than or equal to y + 50. This gives us the loop invariant x <= y + 50.\n\nPost-conditions:\n- y > 100 || y < 100 ==> \\false\n\nExplanation:\n- The post-condition is guarded by a condition, so we use implication to include the guard condition in the loop invariant. The loop invariants imply that y will be between 50 and 100, so the guard condition y > 100 || y < 100 will always be false. Therefore, the loop invariant implies the post-condition."

Since y and z are non-deterministic at the beginning of the loop, we cannot make any assumptions about their values. However, we can say that if z is greater than or equal to y, then after the loop, z must be greater than or equal to the maximum value of y that was seen during the loop execution (which is \\old(y)). Similarly, y must be less than or equal to the minimum value of y that was seen during the loop execution (which is \\old(y)). Therefore, we have z >= y ==> (z >= \\old(y) && y >= \\old(y)).\n- In every iteration: We know that x is incremented by 1 in every iteration, so x > \\old(x) holds. Again, since y and z are non-deterministic at the beginning of the loop, we cannot make any assumptions about their values. However, we can say that if z is greater than or equal to y, then after the loop, z must be greater than or equal to the maximum value of y that was seen during the loop execution (which is y). Similarly, y must be less than or equal to the minimum value of y that was seen during the loop execution (which is \\old(y)). Therefore, we have z >= y ==> (z >= y && y >= \\old(y)). Also, if z is less than or equal to y, then we know that y does not change in this iteration. Therefore, y must be less than or equal to the minimum value of y that was seen during the loop execution (which is \\old(y)). Similarly, z must be greater than or equal to the maximum value of z that was seen during the loop execution (which is \\old(z)). Therefore, we have x > \\old(x) && y <= \\old(y) && z >= \\old(z) && z <= \\old(y) ==> (z >= y && y >= \\old(y)).\n- After the loop: We know that the loop terminates when x becomes 5, so x >= 5 holds. Also, we know that y is the minimum value of y that was seen during the loop execution, and z is the maximum value of z that was seen during the loop execution. Therefore, we have z >= y. \n\nNote that the loop invariants imply the post-condition."

However, we can say that if z is greater than or equal to y, then after the loop, z must be greater than or equal to the maximum value of y that was seen during the loop execution (which is \\old(y)). Similarly, y must be less than or equal to the minimum value of y that was seen during the loop execution (which is \\old(y)). Therefore, we have z >= y ==> (z >= \\old(y) && y >= \\old(y)).\n- In every iteration: We know that x is incremented by 1 in every iteration, so x > \\old(x) holds. Again, since y and z are non-deterministic at the beginning of the loop, we cannot make any assumptions about their values. However, we can say that if z is greater than or equal to y, then after the loop, z must be greater than or equal to the maximum value of y that was seen during the loop execution (which is y). Similarly, y must be less than or equal to the minimum value of y that was seen during the loop execution (which is \\old(y)). Therefore, we have z >= y ==> (z >= y && y >= \\old(y)). Also, if z is less than or equal to y, then we know that y does not change in this iteration. Therefore, y must be less than or equal to the minimum value of y that was seen during the loop execution (which is \\old(y)). Similarly, z must be greater than or equal to the maximum value of z that was seen during the loop execution (which is \\old(z)). Therefore, we have x > \\old(x) && y <= \\old(y) && z >= \\old(z) && z <= \\old(y) ==> (z >= y && y >= \\old(y)).\n- After the loop: We know that the loop terminates when x becomes 5, so x >= 5 holds. Also, we know that y is the minimum value of y that was seen during the loop execution, and z is the maximum value of z that was seen during the loop execution. Therefore, we have z >= y. \n\nNote that the loop invariants imply the post-condition."

This is because the loop updates x and y by adding 2 to their values, and therefore, their maximum value can be 2 + 2 = 4.\n- In every iteration of the loop, both x and y are updated by adding 2 to their values. Therefore, x and y are always even.\n- In every iteration of the loop, x and y cannot take values greater than 4, as this is the maximum value they can take after two iterations of the loop.\n- After the loop termination, x and y can take values up to 6, as they can be updated by adding 2 to their value up to three times.\n- The post-condition specifies that if y is equal to 0, then x is not equal to 4.

If `n > 0`, then we can use implication to show that `m < n`, since `m` is less than or equal to `n` and if it were equal, then `x` would have been incremented at least once, which would have updated `m`."

Therefore, we can only infer that `x` is greater than or equal to 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1.\n- Before the loop executes, `m` is initialized to 1. Therefore, `m` is greater than or equal to 1.\n- In every iteration of the loop, `x` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `x` is always greater than or equal to 1.\n- In every iteration of the loop, if `unknown()` returns true, then `m` is updated to `x`. Therefore, `m` is less than or equal to `x`.\n- In every iteration of the loop, if `x` is less than `n`, then `m` is less than `n`. This is because if `x` is less than `n`, then the assertion `m < n` will eventually be checked and this assertion will only hold if `m` is less than `n`.\n- After the loop terminates, `x` is no longer less than `n`, which implies that `x` is greater than or equal to `n`.\n- After the loop terminates, if `n` is greater than 1, then the assertion `m < n` will be checked. Therefore, if the assertion is true, then `m` must be less than `n`."

Therefore, the implication `(j >= i) && (j <= 20) && (i >= 1) ==> (i % 2 = 1)` is true.\n- Since `j` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, it is always an even number inside the loop.

Therefore, `j-i` is always equal to 19 inside the loop. \n- Since `i` is initially assigned the value 1, it is an odd number. Similarly, since `j` is initially assigned the value 20, it is an even number.\n- The maximum value that `i` can take is 21, which is when `i` is incremented by 2 in each iteration and the loop terminates when `i` becomes 23. Therefore, `i <= 21`.\n- The minimum value that `j` can take is 12, which is when `j` is decremented by 1 in each iteration and the loop terminates when `j` becomes 11. Therefore, `j >= 12`.\n- The difference between `j` and `i` is always 19 inside the loop, so `j-i = 19`.\n- The loop invariant `(j >= i)` implies that `i` is less than or equal to `j`, and `i` and `j` are both between 1 and 20. Therefore, the implication `(j >= i) && (j <= 20) && (i >= 1) ==> (j-i = 19)` is true.\n- Since `i` is incremented by 2 in each iteration, it is always an odd number inside the loop. Therefore, the implication `(j >= i) && (j <= 20) && (i >= 1) ==> (i % 2 = 1)` is true.\n- Since `j` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, it is always an even number inside the loop. Therefore, the implication `(j >= i) && (j <= 20) && (i >= 1) ==> (j % 2 = 0)` is true.\n- Since `j` is always greater than or equal to 12 inside the loop, the implication `(j >= i) && (j <= 20) && (i >= 1) ==> (j >= 12)` is true.\n- Since `i` is always less than or equal to 21 inside the loop, the implication `(j >= i) && (j <= 20) && (i >= 1) ==> (i <= 21)` is true.\n- If `j` is less than `i`, then the loop has terminated and `j` must be equal to 13.

This is because the loop runs while `unknown()` is true, and if `c` is 0 and `unknown()` is false, the loop would terminate immediately and the assertion would not be checked.\n- The third invariant ensures that `c` does not decrease during the loop execution. This is because `c` is only increased inside the loop, and the loop runs while `unknown()` is true. Therefore, if `c` is not 0 at the beginning of the loop, it must be greater than or equal to its previous value.\n- The fourth invariant ensures that `unknown()` is true if `c` is 40 at the end of an iteration. This is because if `c` is 40, it is set to 1 or remains 40 based on the value of `unknown()`, and the loop runs while `unknown()` is true.\n- The fifth invariant ensures that `c` is not 40 at the end of an iteration if it was not 40 at the beginning of the iteration. This is because if `c` is not 40, it is either increased by 1 or set to 1 based on the value of `unknown()`, and the loop runs while `unknown()` is true. Therefore, `c` cannot be 40 at the end of an iteration if it was not 40 at the beginning of the iteration.\n- The sixth invariant ensures that if `c` is 40 at the end of an iteration, it must be between 1 and 40 (inclusive) at the beginning of the next iteration. This is because if `c` is 40, it is set to 1 at the end of the iteration, and the loop runs while `unknown()` is true. Therefore, `c` must be between 1 and 40 (inclusive) at the beginning of the next iteration.\n- The seventh invariant ensures that if `c` is not 40 at the end of an iteration, it must be between 1 and 39 (inclusive) at the beginning of the next iteration. This is because if `c` is not 40, it is increased by 1 at the end of the iteration, and the loop runs while `unknown()` is true. Therefore, `c` must be between 1 and 39 (inclusive) at the beginning of the next iteration."

Since the loop only updates `c` when `unknown()` returns a non-zero value and `c` is initially assigned 0, the only way for `c` to be equal to 40 is if the loop runs exactly 40 times and `unknown()` returns a non-zero value every time.

There are no other constraints on `c` before the loop.\n- In every iteration: Since the loop condition depends on the non-deterministic function `unknown()`, we need to consider two cases:\n  - Case 1: `unknown()` returns a non-zero value. In this case, we have two nested conditions:\n    - If `c == 40`, then `c'` is assigned 1. This means that `c' >= 1`.\n    - If `c != 40`, then `c'` is assigned `c + 1`. This means that `c' > c` and `c' <= 40`.\n  - Case 2: `unknown()` returns a zero value. In this case, we have one nested condition:\n    - If `c != 40`, then `c'` is assigned `c`, which means that `c' == c`.\n    - If `c == 40`, then `c'` can take any value between 1 and 40, inclusive, because `c'` is updated to 1 in the next iteration of the loop.\n- After loop termination: The assertion checks if `c` is equal to 40. Since the loop only updates `c` when `unknown()` returns a non-zero value and `c` is initially assigned 0, the only way for `c` to be equal to 40 is if the loop runs exactly 40 times and `unknown()` returns a non-zero value every time. Therefore, `c` must be equal to 40 after the loop terminates."

Therefore, we need to add an upper bound and a lower bound to `c`. The upper bound is `n+1` because `c` can be incremented up to `n+1` inside the loop. The lower bound is 0 because `c` cannot be negative.\n- If `c` is equal to `n+1`, then the loop has executed at least once because `c` is initialized to 0. Therefore, we add the invariant `(c == n+1) ==> (unknown())`.\n- If `c` is less than or equal to `n`, then the loop has executed at least once because `c` is initialized to 0. Therefore, we add the invariant `(c <= n) ==> (unknown())`.\n- If `c` is less than or equal to `n`, then `c` has been incremented an even number of times because it starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 or not at all in each iteration of the loop. Therefore, we add the invariant `(c <= n) ==> ((unknown() && (c <= n)) ==> (unknown() && (c <= n+1)))`.\n- If `c` is greater than `n`, then `c` has been incremented an odd number of times because it starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 or not at all in each iteration of the loop. Therefore, we add the invariant `(c > n) ==> ((unknown() && (c > n)) ==> (unknown() && (c == 1)))`.\n- Finally, the post-condition is `(c == n)` if `c` is less than or equal to `n` and the loop terminates. Therefore, we add the invariant `(c <= n) ==> (!unknown() ==> (c == n))`. Note that we do not need to add an implication for the case when `c` is greater than `n` because the post-condition does not apply in that case."

Therefore, we need to add an upper bound and a lower bound to `c`. The upper bound is `n+1` because `c` can be incremented up to `n+1` inside the loop. The lower bound is 0 because `c` cannot be negative.\n- If `c` is equal to `n+1`, then the loop has executed at least once because `c` is initialized to 0. Therefore, we add the invariant `(c == n+1) ==> (unknown())`.\n- If `c` is less than or equal to `n`, then the loop has executed at least once because `c` is initialized to 0. Therefore, we add the invariant `(c <= n) ==> (unknown())`.\n- If `c` is less than or equal to `n`, then `c` has been incremented an even number of times because it starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 or not at all in each iteration of the loop. Therefore, we add the invariant `(c <= n) ==> ((unknown() && (c <= n)) ==> (unknown() && (c <= n+1)))`.\n- If `c` is greater than `n`, then `c` has been incremented an odd number of times because it starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 or not at all in each iteration of the loop. Therefore, we add the invariant `(c > n) ==> ((unknown() && (c > n)) ==> (unknown() && (c == 1)))`.\n- Finally, the post-condition is `(c == n)` if `c` is less than or equal to `n` and the loop terminates. Therefore, we add the invariant `(c <= n) ==> (!unknown() ==> (c == n))`. Note that we do not need to add an implication for the case when `c` is greater than `n` because the post-condition does not apply in that case."

Therefore, it must be true that `c >= 0`. We also know that the maximum value `c` can take is 4 because of the assertion at the end of the program. Therefore, the invariant before the loop execution is `c >= 0 && c <= 4`.\n- In every iteration of the loop, there are two cases to consider. If `unknown()` returns a non-zero value, then the code inside the `if` block will be executed, otherwise the code inside the `else` block will be executed. \n    - If `unknown()` returns a non-zero value and `c != 4`, then `c` is incremented by 1, and therefore `c` will always be between 1 and 4. However, if `c` is initially 0, then it will remain 0. Therefore, we can write the invariant as `((unknown() && c != 4) ==> (c >= 1 && c <= 4)) && ((unknown() && c == 0) ==> (c >= 0 && c <= 0))`.\n    - If `unknown()` returns a zero value and `c == 4`, then `c` is assigned the value 1, and therefore `c` will always be between 1 and 3. However, if `c` is initially less than 4, then it will remain the same. Therefore, we can write the invariant as `((!unknown() && c == 4) ==> (c >= 1 && c <= 4)) && ((!unknown() && c != 4) ==> (c >= 1 && c <= 3))`.\n- After the loop termination, we need to ensure that the final value of `c` satisfies the assertion `(c == 4) ==> ((c >= 0) && (c <= 4))`. If `c == 4`, then it must be true that `c >= 0 && c <= 4`. If `c != 4`, then the assertion is vacuously true. Therefore, the invariant is `(c == 4) ==> ((c >= 0) && (c <= 4))`."

Therefore, it must be true that `c >= 0`. We also know that the maximum value `c` can take is 4 because of the assertion at the end of the program. Therefore, the invariant before the loop execution is `c >= 0 && c <= 4`.\n- In every iteration of the loop, there are two cases to consider. If `unknown()` returns a non-zero value, then the code inside the `if` block will be executed, otherwise the code inside the `else` block will be executed. \n    - If `unknown()` returns a non-zero value and `c != 4`, then `c` is incremented by 1, and therefore `c` will always be between 1 and 4. However, if `c` is initially 0, then it will remain 0. Therefore, we can write the invariant as `((unknown() && c != 4) ==> (c >= 1 && c <= 4)) && ((unknown() && c == 0) ==> (c >= 0 && c <= 0))`.\n    - If `unknown()` returns a zero value and `c == 4`, then `c` is assigned the value 1, and therefore `c` will always be between 1 and 3. However, if `c` is initially less than 4, then it will remain the same. Therefore, we can write the invariant as `((!unknown() && c == 4) ==> (c >= 1 && c <= 4)) && ((!unknown() && c != 4) ==> (c >= 1 && c <= 3))`.\n- After the loop termination, we need to ensure that the final value of `c` satisfies the assertion `(c == 4) ==> ((c >= 0) && (c <= 4))`. If `c == 4`, then it must be true that `c >= 0 && c <= 4`. If `c != 4`, then the assertion is vacuously true. Therefore, the invariant is `(c == 4) ==> ((c >= 0) && (c <= 4))`."

Therefore, we can write the implication `(c >= 36) ==> (z >= 0)`.\n\nNote that we do not need to add any bounds on the variables `y` and `c` because they are already bounded by the conditions in the loop. Also, we do not need to add any implication for non-deterministic variables because there are none in this program."

Therefore, in each iteration of the loop, if `i < y`, then `i` is incremented by 1.

Hence, `i` is always less than or equal to `x` after the loop terminates.\n- `i >= y ==> i >= i_old + 1`: This invariant states that if `i` is greater than or equal to `y`, then it must have been incremented by 1 in the current iteration. This is true because the loop condition checks if `unknown()` returns true and the if condition inside the loop only increments `i` if `i < y`.\n- `!(i >= y) ==> (i >= i_old)`: If `i` is less than `y`, then it will not be incremented in the current iteration. Hence, `i` will have the same value as in the previous iteration.\n- `!(i >= x) ==> (i <= i_old)`: If `i` is less than `x`, then it will not be incremented in the current iteration. Hence, `i` will have the same value as in the previous iteration, or a smaller value if it was already less than `i_old`. This ensures that `i` is always less than or equal to `x` after the loop terminates.\n\nFinally, the post-condition assertion is guarded by the condition `(i >= x) && (0 > i)`.

Therefore, in each iteration of the loop, if `i < y`, then `i` is incremented by 1. Hence, `i` is always less than or equal to `y` in every iteration of the loop.\n- `i <= x`: The loop continues until `unknown()` returns false. Therefore, `i` can be incremented at most `y` times in the loop. Hence, `i` is always less than or equal to `x` after the loop terminates.\n- `i >= y ==> i >= i_old + 1`: This invariant states that if `i` is greater than or equal to `y`, then it must have been incremented by 1 in the current iteration. This is true because the loop condition checks if `unknown()` returns true and the if condition inside the loop only increments `i` if `i < y`.\n- `!(i >= y) ==> (i >= i_old)`: If `i` is less than `y`, then it will not be incremented in the current iteration. Hence, `i` will have the same value as in the previous iteration.\n- `!(i >= x) ==> (i <= i_old)`: If `i` is less than `x`, then it will not be incremented in the current iteration. Hence, `i` will have the same value as in the previous iteration, or a smaller value if it was already less than `i_old`. This ensures that `i` is always less than or equal to `x` after the loop terminates.\n\nFinally, the post-condition assertion is guarded by the condition `(i >= x) && (0 > i)`. Therefore, we can use this condition in an implication to obtain the following loop invariant:\n\n- `(i >= x) && (0 > i) ==> (i >= y)`\n\nThis invariant ensures that if the condition `(i >= x) && (0 > i)` holds, then the assertion `(i >= y)` must also hold."

Therefore, we have two cases:\n    - If `lock == 1`, then we know that `x` is equal to `y`, and it is updated to the old value of `y`. Therefore, `(x == \\old(y))` is true.\n    - If `lock == 0`, then we know that `x` is equal to `y`, and it is updated to the old value of `y`, while `y` is updated to the old value of `y` plus `1`. Therefore, `(x == \\old(y)) && (y == \\old(y) + 1)` is true.\n- After the loop, we know that `x` is equal to `y`, and we need to show that `lock == 1`. Therefore, we have the implication `(x == y) ==> (lock == 1)`. This is because the only way `x` can be equal to `y` is if `lock` was set to `1` in the previous iteration of the loop."

Therefore, if `lock` is equal to 1 after the loop terminates, then `x` must still be not equal to `y`.

Therefore, `lock == 1` and `x == y` are true before the loop starts.\n- In every iteration of the loop, we know that `x` is updated to either the current value of `y` or the old value of `y`. Therefore, we have two cases:\n    - If `lock == 1`, then we know that `x` is equal to `y`, and it is updated to the old value of `y`. Therefore, `(x == \\old(y))` is true.\n    - If `lock == 0`, then we know that `x` is equal to `y`, and it is updated to the old value of `y`, while `y` is updated to the old value of `y` plus `1`. Therefore, `(x == \\old(y)) && (y == \\old(y) + 1)` is true.\n- After the loop, we know that `x` is equal to `y`, and we need to show that `lock == 1`. Therefore, we have the implication `(x == y) ==> (lock == 1)`. This is because the only way `x` can be equal to `y` is if `lock` was set to `1` in the previous iteration of the loop."

The loop invariant `(x != y) ==> (lock == 0)` implies that if `x` becomes equal to `y`, then `lock` must be equal to 0. Therefore, if `lock` is equal to 1 after the loop terminates, then `x` must still be not equal to `y`.

Since `lock` is assigned the value 1 at the beginning of the program and is not modified anywhere else, it will always remain 1.\n- `x == y ==> lock == 1`: If `x` is ever equal to `y`, then `lock` must be equal to 1, since that is the only value `lock` can be assigned to in the loop.\n- `v1 <= y`, `v2 <= x`, `v3 <= y`: These inequalities define the lower bounds for `v1`, `v2`, and `v3`, respectively. Since `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` are not assigned any values in the program, their initial values are unknown and can be any value. Therefore, we need to add these inequalities to ensure that the loop invariants hold for any possible value of these variables.\n- `y <= v3 + 1`: This inequality defines the upper bound for `y`. Since `y` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, its maximum value is `v3 + 1`.\n- `x <= v2`, `y <= v1`: These inequalities define the upper bounds for `x` and `y`, respectively. Since `x` is assigned the value of `y` in each iteration of the loop, its value can never be greater than `y`. Similarly, since `y` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, its value can never be greater than `v1`.\n- `x == y ==> v1 == v3`: If `x` is equal to `y`, then `v1` must be equal to `v3`. This is because `v1` is assigned the value of `y` at the end of the loop, while `v3` is assigned the value of `y` in the else branch of the conditional statement.\n- `y > x ==> v1 == v2`: If `y` is greater than `x`, then `v1` must be equal to `v2`. This is because `v1` is assigned the value of `y` at the end of the loop, while `v2` is assigned the value of `y` in the else branch of the conditional statement.\n- `v1 <= y ==> v3 <= y`, `v1 <= y ==> v2 <= y`: These inequalities ensure that `v3` and `v2` are always less than or equal to `y` when `v1` is less than or equal to `y`. This is important because `v3` and `v2` are assigned the value of `y` in the else branch of the conditional statement, and their values must be less than or equal to `y`."

Since `lock` is assigned the value 1 at the beginning of the program and is not modified anywhere else, it will always remain 1.\n- `x == y ==> lock == 1`: If `x` is ever equal to `y`, then `lock` must be equal to 1, since that is the only value `lock` can be assigned to in the loop.\n- `v1 <= y`, `v2 <= x`, `v3 <= y`: These inequalities define the lower bounds for `v1`, `v2`, and `v3`, respectively. Since `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` are not assigned any values in the program, their initial values are unknown and can be any value. Therefore, we need to add these inequalities to ensure that the loop invariants hold for any possible value of these variables.\n- `y <= v3 + 1`: This inequality defines the upper bound for `y`. Since `y` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, its maximum value is `v3 + 1`.\n- `x <= v2`, `y <= v1`: These inequalities define the upper bounds for `x` and `y`, respectively. Since `x` is assigned the value of `y` in each iteration of the loop, its value can never be greater than `y`. Similarly, since `y` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, its value can never be greater than `v1`.\n- `x == y ==> v1 == v3`: If `x` is equal to `y`, then `v1` must be equal to `v3`. This is because `v1` is assigned the value of `y` at the end of the loop, while `v3` is assigned the value of `y` in the else branch of the conditional statement.\n- `y > x ==> v1 == v2`: If `y` is greater than `x`, then `v1` must be equal to `v2`. This is because `v1` is assigned the value of `y` at the end of the loop, while `v2` is assigned the value of `y` in the else branch of the conditional statement.\n- `v1 <= y ==> v3 <= y`, `v1 <= y ==> v2 <= y`: These inequalities ensure that `v3` and `v2` are always less than or equal to `y` when `v1` is less than or equal to `y`. This is important because `v3` and `v2` are assigned the value of `y` in the else branch of the conditional statement, and their values must be less than or equal to `y`."

This means that before the loop, `x` should be equal to `v1` and `y` should be equal to `(v1 + 1)`.\n  - `v1 <= x < y`: Since the loop condition is `x != y`, the value of `x` should be strictly less than the value of `y`. Also, since `v1` is the initial value of `x`, `x` should be greater than or equal to `v1`. Therefore, before the loop, we have `v1 <= x < y`.\n  - `v2 <= lock <= 1`: Since `lock` is assigned the value 0 at the beginning of the program, we have `v2 <= lock`. Also, since `lock` can be assigned the value 1 inside the loop, we have `lock <= 1`. Therefore, before the loop, we have `v2 <= lock <= 1`.\n  - `v3 <= y - x`: Since `v3` is the initial value of `y - x`, we have `v3 <= y - x`.\n- In every iteration of the loop:\n  - `v1 <= x < y`: Since the loop condition is `x != y`, the value of `x` should be strictly less than the value of `y`. Therefore, in every iteration of the loop, we have `v1 <= x < y`.\n  - `v2 <= lock <= 1`: Since `lock` can be assigned the value 0 or 1 inside the loop, we have `v2 <= lock <= 1`.\n  - `v3 <= y - x`: The value of `y` can be incremented by 1 inside the loop. Therefore, in every iteration of the loop, we have `v3 <= y - x`.\n- After the loop termination:\n  - `lock == 1`: The assertion `lock == 1` is guarded by the condition `{;}` which is always true. Therefore, we can use this condition to write the implication `x == y ==> lock == 1`.

Therefore, i <= n is a loop invariant.\n  - The loop body assigns j to j + i, which means that j is incremented by at least i in every iteration. Since i can take any value between 0 and n, inclusive, j is incremented by at least 0, 1, 2, ..., n in the respective iterations. Therefore, j >= 0 and j >= i are loop invariants.\n- After the loop termination:\n  - The loop terminates when i > n. Therefore, we need to add an implication to the post-condition that states that if i > n, then the post-condition holds. Using some algebraic manipulation, we can show that (i + (j + k)) > (2 * n) is equivalent to (i - n) + j > n - k. Therefore, we can restate the post-condition as (i - n) + j > n - k. Now, we can add the implication i > n ==> (i - n) + j > n - k as a loop invariant.

However, we can assume that `n >= 0` since it is not possible for `n` to be negative.\n- Since the loop condition is `(x < n)`, we know that `n >= x` is true in every iteration of the loop.\n- The statement `(x = (x + 1))` increments the value of `x` by `1`. Therefore, the invariant `(x >= \\old(x) && x <= n) ==> (x == \\old(x) + 1)` holds in every iteration of the loop. Here, `\\old(x)` represents the value of `x` before the loop iteration.\n- If the loop terminates, then `(x >= n)` is true. However, the `if` statement after the loop checks if `(x != n)`. This implies that the loop terminated because the loop condition `(x < n)` became false, which in turn implies that `x == n`. Therefore, `((x >= n) && (x != n))` is false after the loop termination. In other words, if `x` is not equal to `n` after the loop, then the loop did not terminate. Using implication, we can say that `((x >= n) && (x != n)) ==> (n < 0)`. This is because the assertion in the `if` statement is `n < 0`."

Here, `\\old(x)` represents the value of `x` before the loop iteration.\n- If the loop terminates, then `(x >= n)` is true. However, the `if` statement after the loop checks if `(x != n)`. This implies that the loop terminated because the loop condition `(x < n)` became false, which in turn implies that `x == n`. Therefore, `((x >= n) && (x != n))` is false after the loop termination. In other words, if `x` is not equal to `n` after the loop, then the loop did not terminate. Using implication, we can say that `((x >= n) && (x != n)) ==> (n < 0)`. This is because the assertion in the `if` statement is `n < 0`."

It asserts that if the loop condition is true, then the sum of `sn` and `i-1` is equal to `n`. This can be proved by induction. Initially, `i=1` and `sn=0`, so the invariant holds. In each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 and `sn` is incremented by 1, so the sum of `sn` and `i-1` increases by 1. Therefore, the invariant holds in every iteration of the loop. After the loop, if `sn != 0`, then the post-condition requires that `sn == n`. Since `sn+i-1 == n` and `i > 1`, we have `i-1 >= 1` and `sn <= i-1`, so `sn+i-1 <= 2*(i-1)`. Therefore, if `sn != 0`, then `sn+i-1 == n` implies `sn == n`."

It asserts that if the loop condition is true, then the sum of `sn` and `i-1` is equal to `n`. This can be proved by induction. Initially, `i=1` and `sn=0`, so the invariant holds. In each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 and `sn` is incremented by 1, so the sum of `sn` and `i-1` increases by 1. Therefore, the invariant holds in every iteration of the loop. After the loop, if `sn != 0`, then the post-condition requires that `sn == n`. Since `sn+i-1 == n` and `i > 1`, we have `i-1 >= 1` and `sn <= i-1`, so `sn+i-1 <= 2*(i-1)`.
