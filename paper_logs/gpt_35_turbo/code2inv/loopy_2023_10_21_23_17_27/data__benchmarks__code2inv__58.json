If `c` is not equal to `n`, then it can be at most `n-1`, and if it does equal `n`, then the implication is trivially true.\n- The fourth invariant `v3 = (c != n) ==> (c >= 0)` holds true in every iteration of the loop because of the implication. If `c` is not equal to `n`, then it can be at least 0, and if it does equal `n`, then the implication is trivially true.\n- After the loop termination, the first three invariants still hold true. The fourth invariant is trivially true because `c` is either equal to `n` or less than `n`, and the assertion `assert( (c >= 0) );` is true. We do not need to use the guard condition for this assertion because it is not inside the loop.",

Also, `n` remains greater than `0`.\n- The loop invariants imply the post-condition because if `c` is not equal to `n`, then the assertion is not executed and does not need to be verified.
