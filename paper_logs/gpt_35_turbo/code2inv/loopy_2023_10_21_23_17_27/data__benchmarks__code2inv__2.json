Therefore, `x` is greater than or equal to `1` and `y` is greater than or equal to `0`.\n- In every iteration of the loop, `x` is incremented by `y` and `y` is incremented by `1`. Therefore, `x` is always greater than or equal to `y` in every iteration of the loop. Also, `y` is less than `1000` because the loop condition is `y < 1000`. Finally, `x` is bounded by the sum of arithmetic series `0+1+...+n`, where `n` is the number of iterations of the loop. This sum is equal to `(n*(n+1))/2`, which is equal to `(y*(y+1))/2` at the end of the loop.\n- After the loop termination, `x` is greater than or equal to `y` because the loop invariant `x >= y` holds in every iteration of the loop.",
