The third invariant uses implication to handle the case where `x` is initially 0, in which case we cannot say anything about `z`.\n- After the loop termination, `x` is greater than or equal to `size`, and `y` is greater than or equal to `z`. Thus, the assertion `z >= y` holds if `size` is greater than 0. This can be written as:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= size;\n    loop invariant y >= z;\n    loop assigns x;\n    loop assigns y;\n    loop assigns z;\n*/\nif(size > 0) {\n    assume(z >= y);\n}\n```\nHere, the loop assigns clause is added to specify which variables are modified inside the loop. The assertion is guarded by `size > 0`, so we use implication to ensure that the assertion holds only when the guard condition is true.",

Hence, we add the invariant `y >= z` in every iteration.\n- After the loop, we have the assertion `z >= y` inside a conditional statement. Therefore, we add the guard condition `{ size > 0 }` in an implication to ensure that the assertion holds only when `size` is greater than 0. Then we use the invariant `y >= z` to show that `z >= y` holds when `size` is greater than 0.",
