Otherwise, if `unknown()` is false, then `c` is always less than `n`.\n- Invariant 3: If `unknown()` is true, then `c` can be incremented to at most `n`, so `c` must always be less than or equal to `n-1`. Otherwise, `c` can be reset to 1, which is less than or equal to `n`.\n\nNote: Since `unknown()` is a non-deterministic function, we cannot make any assumptions about the value it returns.
