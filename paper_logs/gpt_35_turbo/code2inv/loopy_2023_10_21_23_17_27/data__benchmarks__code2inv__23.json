This is true because i starts at 1 and j starts at 20, and in each iteration of the loop, i is incremented by 2 and j is decremented by 1. Therefore, the difference between j and i decreases by 3 in each iteration, so it will eventually become negative, but will always be at least -8 after the loop terminates.\n- The fourth invariant specifies that the difference between j and i, plus 1, is always even.

Therefore, the implication `(j >= i) && (j <= 20) && (i >= 1) ==> (j % 2 = 0)` is true.\n- Since `j` is always greater than or equal to 12 inside the loop, the implication `(j >= i) && (j <= 20) && (i >= 1) ==> (j >= 12)` is true.\n- Since `i` is always less than or equal to 21 inside the loop, the implication `(j >= i) && (j <= 20) && (i >= 1) ==> (i <= 21)` is true.\n- If `j` is less than `i`, then the loop has terminated and `j` must be equal to 13. Therefore, the implication `(j < i) ==> (j = 13)` is true.\n- If `j` is less than `i`, then the loop has terminated and `i` must be less than or equal to 21 and `j` must be greater than or equal to 12.

Therefore, `j-i` is always equal to 19 inside the loop. \n- Since `i` is initially assigned the value 1, it is an odd number. Similarly, since `j` is initially assigned the value 20, it is an even number.\n- The maximum value that `i` can take is 21, which is when `i` is incremented by 2 in each iteration and the loop terminates when `i` becomes 23. Therefore, `i <= 21`.\n- The minimum value that `j` can take is 12, which is when `j` is decremented by 1 in each iteration and the loop terminates when `j` becomes 11. Therefore, `j >= 12`.\n- The difference between `j` and `i` is always 19 inside the loop, so `j-i = 19`.\n- The loop invariant `(j >= i)` implies that `i` is less than or equal to `j`, and `i` and `j` are both between 1 and 20. Therefore, the implication `(j >= i) && (j <= 20) && (i >= 1) ==> (j-i = 19)` is true.\n- Since `i` is incremented by 2 in each iteration, it is always an odd number inside the loop. Therefore, the implication `(j >= i) && (j <= 20) && (i >= 1) ==> (i % 2 = 1)` is true.\n- Since `j` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, it is always an even number inside the loop. Therefore, the implication `(j >= i) && (j <= 20) && (i >= 1) ==> (j % 2 = 0)` is true.\n- Since `j` is always greater than or equal to 12 inside the loop, the implication `(j >= i) && (j <= 20) && (i >= 1) ==> (j >= 12)` is true.\n- Since `i` is always less than or equal to 21 inside the loop, the implication `(j >= i) && (j <= 20) && (i >= 1) ==> (i <= 21)` is true.\n- If `j` is less than `i`, then the loop has terminated and `j` must be equal to 13.

Therefore, `j-i` is always equal to 19 inside the loop. \n- Since `i` is initially assigned the value 1, it is an odd number. Similarly, since `j` is initially assigned the value 20, it is an even number.\n- The maximum value that `i` can take is 21, which is when `i` is incremented by 2 in each iteration and the loop terminates when `i` becomes 23. Therefore, `i <= 21`.\n- The minimum value that `j` can take is 12, which is when `j` is decremented by 1 in each iteration and the loop terminates when `j` becomes 11. Therefore, `j >= 12`.\n- The difference between `j` and `i` is always 19 inside the loop, so `j-i = 19`.\n- The loop invariant `(j >= i)` implies that `i` is less than or equal to `j`, and `i` and `j` are both between 1 and 20. Therefore, the implication `(j >= i) && (j <= 20) && (i >= 1) ==> (j-i = 19)` is true.\n- Since `i` is incremented by 2 in each iteration, it is always an odd number inside the loop. Therefore, the implication `(j >= i) && (j <= 20) && (i >= 1) ==> (i % 2 = 1)` is true.\n- Since `j` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, it is always an even number inside the loop. Therefore, the implication `(j >= i) && (j <= 20) && (i >= 1) ==> (j % 2 = 0)` is true.\n- Since `j` is always greater than or equal to 12 inside the loop, the implication `(j >= i) && (j <= 20) && (i >= 1) ==> (j >= 12)` is true.\n- Since `i` is always less than or equal to 21 inside the loop, the implication `(j >= i) && (j <= 20) && (i >= 1) ==> (i <= 21)` is true.\n- If `j` is less than `i`, then the loop has terminated and `j` must be equal to 13. Therefore, the implication `(j < i) ==> (j = 13)` is true.\n- If `j` is less than `i`, then the loop has terminated and `i` must be less than or equal to 21 and `j` must be greater than or equal to 12.
