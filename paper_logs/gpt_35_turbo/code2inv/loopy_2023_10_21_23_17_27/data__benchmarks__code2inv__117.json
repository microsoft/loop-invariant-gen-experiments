This is because `sn` starts at 0 and is incremented by at least 1 in every iteration of the loop. Thus, `sn` is always less than or equal to `x`. \n\nFinally, we did not add any bounds on `v1`, `v2`, `v3` since they are not used in the program and we have no information about their values.",
                    "First, let's consider the pre-conditions and variable assignments in the program:\n- The macro `assume` takes a boolean expression and returns 0 if the expression is false.\n- The function `unknown()` returns a non-deterministic integer value.\n- There are five integer variables `sn`, `v1`, `v2`, `v3`, and `x`.\n- `sn` and `x` are assigned 0.\n\nNext, let's analyze the loop body and the loop condition:\n- The loop body contains two assignments: `x = x + 1` and `sn = sn + 1`.\n- The loop condition is a call to the non-deterministic function `unknown()`. \n\nBased on the program, we can come up with the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= x;\n    loop invariant sn >= 0;\n    loop invariant sn == \\sum(0, i, sn); // sn is the sum of itself so far\n    loop invariant x == \\sum(0, i, x); // x is the sum of itself so far\n    loop invariant sn <= x;\n    loop invariant x <= sn + 1;\n*/\n```\nExplanation:\n- The loop invariant `0 <= x` holds before the loop because `x` is assigned 0 before the loop.\n- The loop invariant `sn >= 0` holds before the loop because `sn` is assigned 0 before the loop.\n- The loop invariant `sn == \\sum(0, i, sn)` holds in every iteration of the loop because `sn` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, and the sum of the first `n` integers is `n(n+1)/2`.\n- The loop invariant `x == \\sum(0, i, x)` holds in every iteration of the loop because `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, and the sum of the first `n` integers is `n(n+1)/2`.\n- The loop invariant `sn <= x` holds in every iteration of the loop because `sn` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.\n- The loop invariant `x <= sn + 1` holds in every iteration of the loop because `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, and the loop condition is a call to `unknown()` which can return 0, making the loop terminate one iteration later than usual.\n\nFinally, we need to show that the loop invariants imply the post-condition `sn == x`, which is guarded by the condition `(sn != -1)`:\n- Since `sn >= 0`, we have `sn != -1`.\n- Using the loop invariant `sn == \\sum(0, i, sn)`, we get `sn == \\sum(0, n, sn)`, where `n` is the number of iterations of the loop.\n- Using the loop invariant `x == \\sum(0, i, x)`, we get `x == \\sum(0, n, x)`, where `n` is the number of iterations of the loop.\n- Since the loop condition is a call to `unknown()` which can return any non-zero value, we can use the implication `(unknown() ==> (sn == x))` to show that the post-condition holds after the loop terminates. \n\nTherefore, the loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= x;\n    loop invariant sn >= 0;\n    loop invariant sn == \\sum(0, i, sn); // sn is the sum of itself so far\n    loop invariant x == \\sum(0, i, x); // x is the sum of itself so far\n    loop invariant sn <= x;\n    loop invariant x <= sn + 1;\n*/\n```",
