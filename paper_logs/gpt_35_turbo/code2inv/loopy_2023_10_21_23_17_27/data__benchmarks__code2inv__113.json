This is because the loop condition is that `i` is less than or equal to `n`, so if the loop terminates, it must be because `i` is greater than `n`. Therefore, we have the following loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant i > n ==> sn == n; */\n```\n- The post-condition is that if `sn` is not equal to 0, then it must be equal to `n`. Therefore, we have the following loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant (sn != 0) ==> (sn == n); */\n```\nPutting all the loop invariants together, we have:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 1 <= i <= n + 1;\n    loop invariant 0 <= sn;\n    loop invariant sn == i - 1;\n    loop invariant i > n ==> sn == n;\n    loop invariant (sn != 0) ==> (sn == n);\n*/\n```",
                    "We can start by identifying the pre-conditions and variable assignments in the program.\n\nPre-conditions:\n- None\n\nVariable assignments:\n- `sn` is assigned the value of 0\n- `i` is assigned the value of 1\n\nNext, let's analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. The loop condition is `i <= n`. The loop body contains two assignments:\n- `i = i + 1`\n- `sn = sn + 1`\n\nTo help Frama-C verify the post-condition, we need to find loop invariants that are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination, such that the loop invariants imply the post-condition.\n\nLoop invariants:\n- Before loop execution:\n    - None\n- In every iteration of the loop:\n    - `1 <= i <= n + 1`\n    - `0 <= sn <= i - 1`\n- After loop termination:\n    - `(i == n + 1) ==> (sn == n)`\n    \nLet's explain each of these loop invariants:\n- Before loop execution:\n    - There are no pre-conditions that we need to satisfy before entering the loop.\n- In every iteration of the loop:\n    - The first invariant states that `i` is always between 1 and `n + 1`. This is true because `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in every iteration until it becomes `n + 1` and the loop terminates. Therefore, `i` is always between 1 and `n + 1`.\n    - The second invariant states that `sn` is always between 0 and `i - 1`. This is true because `sn` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in every iteration. Therefore, `sn` is always between 0 and `i - 1`.\n- After loop termination:\n    - The third invariant states that if `i` is equal to `n + 1`, then `sn` is equal to `n`. This is true because `sn` is incremented by 1 in every iteration of the loop, and `i` is incremented by 1 until it becomes `n + 1`. Therefore, if `i` is equal to `n + 1`, then `sn` is equal to `n`.\n\nWe can combine these loop invariants into a single code block as follows:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 1 <= i <= n + 1;\n    loop invariant 0 <= sn <= i - 1;\n    loop invariant (i == n + 1) ==> (sn == n);\n*/\n``` \nNote that we did not need to add any conjunctions to bound the maximum and minimum values for the variables since their values are explicitly assigned in the program. Also, since there are no non-deterministic variables in the program, we did not need to use any implications to make the loop invariants true. Finally, the post-condition is guarded by a condition (`sn != 0`), so we need to use implication to make the assertion true. This implication is already present in the program.",

The conjunction of `(i <= n + 1)` and `(sn == i - 1)` ensures that both `i` and `sn` are within their bounds.\n- The fifth invariant is true after the loop terminates because `i` is equal to `n + 1` and `sn` is equal to `i - 1` which implies that `sn` is equal to `n`. The implication of `(i == n + 1) ==> (sn == n)` is used to handle the case where `n` is `0`, in which case the loop is not executed and the post-condition is already satisfied.",
