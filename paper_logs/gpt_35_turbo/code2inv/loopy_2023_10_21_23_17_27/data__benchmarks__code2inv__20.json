This implies that `m` is always increasing or stays the same in every iteration.\n- `(\\forall integer i; 0 <= i < x ==> (unknown() ==> m >= i))`: For all `i` between 0 and `x-1`, if `unknown()` returns true for any iteration `i`, then `m` is greater than or equal to `i`. This is because if `unknown()` returns true for an iteration `i`, then `m` is updated to `i`.\n- `(\\forall integer i; 0 <= i < x ==> (!unknown() ==> m == \\old(m)))`: For all `i` between 0 and `x-1`, if `unknown()` returns false for any iteration `i`, then `m` remains the same as its previous value.

Also, if `m` is greater than or equal to 0, then `x` must be strictly greater than `m` because `m` is only updated when `unknown()` returns true.\n- `(n > 0 ==> (m < 0 ==> x <= m+1))`: If `n` is greater than 0, then if `m` is less than 0, then `x` must be less than or equal to `m+1`. This is because if `m` is less than 0, then `x` can never be greater than `m+1`.\n- `(n > 0 ==> (m >= 0 ==> x-m <= n-m))`: If `n` is greater than 0, then if `m` is greater than or equal to 0, then the difference between `x` and `m` must be less than or equal to `n-m`. This is because `m` is only updated when `unknown()` returns true, so the difference between `x` and `m` can never be greater than the number of times `unknown()` returns true before `x` reaches `n`.\n- `loop variant n-x`: The value of `n-x",
