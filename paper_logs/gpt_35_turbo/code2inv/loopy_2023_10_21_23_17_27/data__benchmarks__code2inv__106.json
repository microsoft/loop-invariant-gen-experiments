The variables `a` and `m` are never modified in the loop body. Therefore, `a` remains less than or equal to `m` throughout the loop. The condition `(k == 0 && a >= m) || (k == 1 && a <= m)` holds true in every iteration. The condition `(k == 0 && a >= m)` holds true at the beginning of the loop when `k` is 0 and `a` is greater than or equal to `m`. The condition `(k == 1 && a <= m)` holds true at the end of the loop when `k` is 1 and `a` is less than or equal to `m`.\n- After the loop termination, `a` is greater than or equal to `m`. This is because `a` is always less than or equal to `m` before the loop and the loop condition is `k < 1`, which means the loop is executed at most once. Therefore, `a` must be greater than or equal to `m` after the loop terminates.",
