This invariant implies the post-condition, because if `i` is not equal to `j`, then the assertion `y != 1` must hold.",
                    "Pre-conditions/Variable Assignments:\n- The program defines a macro `assume(e)` that returns 0 if the expression `e` is false.\n- The program declares four integer variables `i`, `j`, `x`, and `y`.\n- `j` is initialized to 0.\n- `i` is initialized to 0.\n- `y` is initialized to 1.\n\nLoop Condition:\n- The loop executes as long as the condition `(i <= x)` is true.\n\nLoop Invariants:\n- Before the loop: Since `i` and `j` are initialized to 0, we can say that `i >= 0` and `j >= 0`. Also, since `y` is initialized to 1, we can say that `y >= 1`. Since `x` is not initialized, we cannot say anything about its initial value. Hence, we use an implication to make the invariant trivially true: `(x >= 0) ==> true`.\n- In every iteration of the loop: \n    - Since `(i <= x)` is the loop condition, we can say that `i <= x`. \n    - Also, since `j` is updated as `j = j + y` in every iteration of the loop, we can say that `j >= i`. \n    - Further, since `y` is always 1, we can say that `j >= i*1`. Hence, we can say that `j >= i`. \n    - Since `i` is updated as `i = i + 1` in every iteration of the loop, we can say that `i >= 1`. \n    - Thus, the loop invariants are:\n    ```\n    /*@ \n        loop invariant i >= 1;\n        loop invariant i <= x + 1;\n        loop invariant j >= i;\n    */\n    ```\n- After the loop: \n    - Since the loop terminates when `(i > x)`, we can say that `i > x`. \n    - Also, since `j` is updated as `j = j + y` in every iteration of the loop, we can say that `j = i + y*(number of iterations)`. \n    - Since the loop executes `x+1` times (assuming `x >= 0`), we can say that the number of iterations is `x+1-i`. \n    - Hence, we can say that `j = i + y*(x+1-i)`. Simplifying, we get `j = (1-y)*i + y*(x+1)`. \n    - Since the post-condition is `(i != j) ==> (y != 1)`, we can use an implication to make the invariant trivially true if `i = j`. Hence, the final loop invariant is:\n    ```\n    /*@ \n        loop invariant (i > x) ==> (j = (1-y)*i + y*(x+1));\n        loop invariant (i <= x) ==> (j = (1-y)*i + y*(x+1-i));\n        loop invariant (i != j) ==> (y != 1);\n    */\n    ```"
