Therefore, we only know that `x` is non-negative and at most 2.\n- Similarly, `y` is also initialized to a garbage value, so we can only assume that it is non-negative and at most 2.\n- The loop body updates `x` and `y` by adding 2 to each in every iteration. Therefore, `x` and `y` can be at most 4 at any point in the loop.\n- If `x` is equal to 2, then it must be the case that `y` is also equal to 2. This is because the loop body adds 2 to both `x` and `y` in each iteration, so they are always equal if they are ever equal.\n- Finally, after the loop terminates, if `x` is equal to 4, then it must be the case that `y` is not equal to 0. This is because the post-condition is guarded by an implication where the condition is `x == 4`. Therefore, if `x` is not equal to 4, the post-condition is vacuously true. But if `x` is equal to 4, then `y` must be non-zero, otherwise the assertion would fail.",
