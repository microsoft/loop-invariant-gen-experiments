This means that before the loop, `x` should be equal to `v1` and `y` should be equal to `(v1 + 1)`.\n  - `v1 <= x < y`: Since the loop condition is `x != y`, the value of `x` should be strictly less than the value of `y`. Also, since `v1` is the initial value of `x`, `x` should be greater than or equal to `v1`. Therefore, before the loop, we have `v1 <= x < y`.\n  - `v2 <= lock <= 1`: Since `lock` is assigned the value 0 at the beginning of the program, we have `v2 <= lock`. Also, since `lock` can be assigned the value 1 inside the loop, we have `lock <= 1`. Therefore, before the loop, we have `v2 <= lock <= 1`.\n  - `v3 <= y - x`: Since `v3` is the initial value of `y - x`, we have `v3 <= y - x`.\n- In every iteration of the loop:\n  - `v1 <= x < y`: Since the loop condition is `x != y`, the value of `x` should be strictly less than the value of `y`. Therefore, in every iteration of the loop, we have `v1 <= x < y`.\n  - `v2 <= lock <= 1`: Since `lock` can be assigned the value 0 or 1 inside the loop, we have `v2 <= lock <= 1`.\n  - `v3 <= y - x`: The value of `y` can be incremented by 1 inside the loop. Therefore, in every iteration of the loop, we have `v3 <= y - x`.\n- After the loop termination:\n  - `lock == 1`: The assertion `lock == 1` is guarded by the condition `{;}` which is always true.

This is because when `lock` is equal to 1, `x` is assigned the value of `y`, and since `y` is not incremented in that iteration, `x` is equal to `y`.\n\nFinally, we use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code.

Also, since `v1` is the initial value of `x`, `x` should be greater than or equal to `v1`. Therefore, before the loop, we have `v1 <= x < y`.\n  - `v2 <= lock <= 1`: Since `lock` is assigned the value 0 at the beginning of the program, we have `v2 <= lock`. Also, since `lock` can be assigned the value 1 inside the loop, we have `lock <= 1`.

Therefore, in every iteration of the loop, we have `v3 <= y - x`.\n- After the loop termination:\n  - `lock == 1`: The assertion `lock == 1` is guarded by the condition `{;}` which is always true. Therefore, we can use this condition to write the implication `x == y ==> lock == 1`. Since the loop terminates when `x` becomes equal to `y`, the implication holds after the loop termination.\n  - `x == y`: Since the loop condition is `x != y`, the loop terminates only when `x` becomes equal to `y`. Therefore, after the loop termination, we have `x == y`.",

Therefore, in every iteration of the loop, we have `v1 <= x < y`.\n  - `v2 <= lock <= 1`: Since `lock` can be assigned the value 0 or 1 inside the loop, we have `v2 <= lock <= 1`.\n  - `v3 <= y - x`: The value of `y` can be incremented by 1 inside the loop. Therefore, in every iteration of the loop, we have `v3 <= y - x`.\n- After the loop termination:\n  - `lock == 1`: The assertion `lock == 1` is guarded by the condition `{;}` which is always true. Therefore, we can use this condition to write the implication `x == y ==> lock == 1`. Since the loop terminates when `x` becomes equal to `y`, the implication holds after the loop termination.\n  - `x == y`: Since the loop condition is `x != y`, the loop terminates only when `x` becomes equal to `y`. Therefore, after the loop termination, we have `x == y`.",

Since they are not defined, they can have garbage values. Therefore, we can assume that they are less than or equal to `x`, `y`, and `y-x`, respectively.\n- In every iteration of the loop, `x` and `y` are updated. Therefore, `y` is always greater than `x`.\n- The loop terminates when `x` is equal to `y`. Therefore, after the loop termination, `x` is equal to `y`. \n- The post-condition is `(lock == 1)`. Since the loop terminates only when `lock` is equal to `1`, we can add the guard condition `lock == 1` to the post-condition. Therefore, the post-condition is `(lock == 1) ==> (lock == 1)`.",
