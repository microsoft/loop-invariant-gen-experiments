This corresponds to the if statement inside the loop that checks if the condition (unknown()) is true. If it is true and c is greater than n, then c is incremented and v1 is set to 0.\n- The third loop invariant states that if c is not equal to n, then v2 is 0. This corresponds to the if statement inside the loop that checks if the condition (unknown()) is false. If it is false and c is equal to n, then c is set to 1 and v2 is set to 0.\n- The fourth loop invariant states that if c is equal to n, then v3 is 0. This corresponds to the if statement inside the loop that checks if the condition (unknown()) is true. If it is true and c is greater than n, then c is incremented and v3 is set to 0.\n- The fifth loop invariant states that if c is not equal to n, then v3 is 1. This corresponds to the if statement inside the loop that checks if the condition (unknown()) is false. If it is false and c is not equal to n, then v3 is set to 1.\n- The sixth loop invariant states that if c is not equal to n, then v1 is 1.

Therefore, before the loop starts, `c` is less than or equal to `n + 1`.\n- In every iteration of the loop, `c` is either incremented by 1 or reset to 1. Therefore, if the first `unknown()` call returns true, `c` will be less than or equal to `n + 1`. Similarly, if the first `unknown()` call returns false, `c` will be less than or equal to `n`.\n- If the second `unknown()` call returns true, `c` will be greater than or equal to 1. If the second `unknown()` call returns false, `c` will remain greater than or equal to 0.\n- After the loop termination, `c` must be either equal to `n` or `n+1`. This is because if the loop terminates with `c < n`, then the loop condition `unknown()` must have returned false, and the `if` condition that resets `c` to 1 must have been executed. If the loop terminates with `c = n`, then the `if` condition that increments `c` must have been executed. Therefore, `c <= n+1` after the loop termination. Similarly, `c >= 1` because it is incremented at least once in the loop. \n\nTherefore, the loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant c >= 0 && n > 0;\n    loop invariant unknown() ==> c <= n + 1;\n    loop invariant !unknown() ==> c <= n;\n    loop invariant unknown() ==> c >= 1;\n    loop invariant !unknown() ==> c >= 0;\n    loop invariant (c == n || c == n + 1);\n*/\n```",

We can see that `c` is incremented by 1 each time the condition `(c > n)` is true.

Therefore, `v1` must be greater than or equal to 0.\n  - If `v3` is zero, then we set `c` to 1 only if `c` is equal to `n`. Therefore, `v1` must be greater than or equal to 1.\n  - `v1` must be less than or equal to `n` to ensure that the loop terminates.\n  - `v2` must be less than or equal to `n`.\n  - `v1` must be greater than or equal to 0.\n  - `v2` must be greater than 0.\n  - We need to remember the value of `unknown()` at the beginning of each loop iteration, so we introduce `v3`.\n\n- After the loop termination:\n  - If `c` is not equal to `n`, then the assertion is guarded by the condition `(c != n)`.
