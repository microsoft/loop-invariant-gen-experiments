In every iteration of the loop, both x and y are non-negative. The sum of x and y is always equal to n, since we decrement x by 1 and increment y by 1 in every iteration. Also, if x is greater than 0, we know that y must be less than n, since y is incremented by 1 in every iteration.\n3. After the loop terminates, x must be equal to 0, since we decrement it by 1 in every iteration until it reaches 0. Similarly, y must be equal to n, since we increment it by 1 in every iteration. \n\nTherefore, the loop invariants imply the post-condition that y is equal to n after the loop terminates.",
