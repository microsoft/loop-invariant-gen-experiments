This is because `x` is initialized to 1 and its value is incremented by 1 in every iteration of the loop until it becomes 11. \n- The second loop invariant (`0 <= y <= 10`) states that `y` is always between 0 and 10 (inclusive) before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop and after the loop termination. This is because `y` is assigned the value `10 - x` in every iteration of the loop, and since `x` is between 1 and 11 (inclusive), `y` is between 0 and 10 (inclusive).\n- The third loop invariant (`x <= 12`) states that `x` is always less than or equal to 12 after the loop termination. This is because `x` is incremented by 1 in every iteration of the loop until it becomes 11, and then the loop terminates and `x` is incremented one more time (outside the loop) to become 12.\n- The fourth loop invariant (`y <= 10`) is a restatement of the second loop invariant.\n- The fifth loop invariant (`x >= 1`) is a restatement of the first loop invariant.\n- The sixth loop invariant (`y >= 0`) is a restatement of the second loop invariant.\n\nNow, let's use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code and use the guard condition of the assertion in an implication to come up with the final set of loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 1 <= x <= 11;\n    loop invariant 0 <= y <= 10;\n    loop invariant x <= 12;\n    loop invariant y <= 10;\n    loop invariant x >= 1;\n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n    loop invariant !(x <= 10) ==> (y < 10);\n*/\n```\nExplanation for the final loop invariant:\n- The seventh loop invariant (`!(x <= 10) ==> (y < 10)`) states that if `x` is greater than 10 (i.e., the loop has terminated), then `y` is less than 10. This takes care of the guard condition of the assertion, which is executed after the loop. If the loop has terminated, then `y` is assigned the value `10 - x`, where `x` is greater than 10, so `y` must be less than 10. If the loop has not terminated, then this loop invariant is trivially true (since the implication is true when the antecedent is false).",

Invariant: `y <= 9`.\n\nExplanation: Since `x <= 11`, the maximum value of `y` occurs when `x` is minimum, i.e., when `x` is `1`. At that point, `y` is equal to `10 - x`, which is `9`. Therefore, `y` is always less than or equal to `9`.\n\nUsing these invariants, we can prove that `y < 10` after the loop termination:\n\n```\ny == 10 - x; // from Invariant 2\nx > 10 ==> y < 0; // 10 - x is negative\n1 <= x <= 11; // from Invariant 1\nx > 10 ==> false; // from Invariant 1\ny <= 9; // from Invariant 3\n1 <= x <= 10 ==> y >= 1; // 10 - x is positive\n1 <= x <= 10 ==> y < 10; // y is less than or equal to 9\n```\n\nTherefore, the necessary loop invariants are:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 1 <= x <= 11;\n    loop invariant y == 10 - x;\n    loop invariant y <= 9;\n*/\n``` \n\nNote that we did not need to use any implication, as the loop condition is straightforward.

The fourth loop invariant ensures that y is always greater than or equal to -9 in every iteration of the loop. The fifth loop invariant ensures that if x is greater than 10, then y is less than 10.
