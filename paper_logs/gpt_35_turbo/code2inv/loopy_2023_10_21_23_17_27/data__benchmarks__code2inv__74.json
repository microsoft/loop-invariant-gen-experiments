                    "Before the loop execution, the following loop invariants hold:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= c <= 36;\n    loop invariant 0 <= z <= 36*y + 36;\n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n    loop invariant y >= 127 ==> z >= 4572;\n*/\n```\nHere, we have used conjunctions to bound the maximum and minimum values that the variables can take. Since `c` is initialized to 0 before the loop, `0 <= c` holds. The value of `c` can never exceed 36, since it can only be incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, and the loop condition is unknown. Therefore, `c <= 36` holds. \n\nThe value of `z` is initialized to `36*y`, which gives us `0 <= z`. Since `c` can only be incremented by 1 in each iteration, `z` can increase by at most 36 in each iteration of the loop. Therefore, `z <= 36*y + 36`. \n\nThe variable `y` is assumed to be non-negative, so `y >= 0` holds. It is also assumed to be greater than or equal to 127, so `y >= 127 ==> z >= 4572` holds. \n\nIn every iteration of the loop, the following loop invariants hold:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= c <= 36;\n    loop invariant 0 <= z <= 36*y + 36;\n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n    loop invariant y >= 127 ==> z >= 4572;\n    loop invariant c < 36 ==> z - 36 + c <= 36*y;\n*/\n```\nHere, we have added an invariant to capture the relationship between `c` and `z`. In each iteration of the loop, if `c` is less than 36, then `z` is incremented by 1 and `c` is incremented by 1. Therefore, if `c < 36`, then `z - 36 + c` is less than or equal to `36*y`. \n\nAfter the loop termination, the following loop invariants hold:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= c <= 36;\n    loop invariant 0 <= z <= 36*y + 36;\n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n    loop invariant y >= 127 ==> z >= 4572;\n    loop invariant c < 36 ==> z - 36 + c <= 36*y;\n    loop invariant c >= 36 ==> z >= 36*y;\n    loop invariant c >= 36 ==> z >= 4572;\n*/\n```\nHere, we have added invariants to capture the relationship between `c` and `z` after the loop. If `c` is not less than 36, then `z` must be greater than or equal to `36*y`. Therefore, `c >= 36 ==> z >= 36*y` holds. Since `y >= 127`, `36*y >= 4572`, so `c >= 36 ==> z >= 4572` also holds. \n\nFinally, we use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the assertion. Since the assertion is guarded by the condition `(c < 36)`, we can add the following loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant (c < 36) ==> (z >= 0);\n*/\n```\nThis invariant is trivially true when `c` is not less than 36, since the implication is vacuously true. When `c` is less than 36, the invariant implies the post-condition of the program. \n\nPutting it all together, the loop invariants for the program are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= c <= 36;\n    loop invariant 0 <= z <= 36*y + 36;\n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n    loop invariant y >= 127 ==> z >= 4572;\n    loop invariant c < 36 ==> z - 36 + c <= 36*y;\n    loop invariant c >= 36 ==> z >= 36*y;\n    loop invariant c >= 36 ==> z >= 4572;\n    loop invariant (c < 36) ==> (z >= 0);\n*/\n```",

This will ensure that the computation of `z` is within bounds.\n- In every iteration of the loop, we need to ensure that the computation of `z` is correct and that `c` is between 0 and 36. The loop modifies the values of `c` and `z`, but `y` remains constant. Thus, we can use `y` to compute the expected value of `z` and compare it with the actual value of `z`. We also need to ensure that `c` remains within the range of 0 to 36.\n\n- After loop termination:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant (c >= 36) ==> (z >= 0);\n*/\n```\nExplanation:\n- After the loop terminates, we need to ensure that if `c` is less than 36, then `z` is greater than or equal to 0. This is because the assertion is guarded by the condition `(c < 36)`. If `c` is less than 36, then the assertion should hold, which means that `z` should be greater than or equal to 0.\n\nPutting all the loop invariants together, we have:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n    loop invariant y >= 127;\n\n    loop invariant z == (36 * y) + c;\n    loop invariant 0 <= c <= 36;\n\n    loop invariant (c >= 36) ==> (z >= 0);\n*/\n```",
