This is because the loop updates x and y by adding 2 to their values, and therefore, their maximum value can be 2 + 2 = 4.\n- In every iteration of the loop, both x and y are updated by adding 2 to their values. Therefore, x and y are always even.\n- In every iteration of the loop, x and y cannot take values greater than 4, as this is the maximum value they can take after two iterations of the loop.\n- After the loop termination, x and y can take values up to 6, as they can be updated by adding 2 to their value up to three times.\n- The post-condition specifies that if y is equal to 0, then x is not equal to 4.
