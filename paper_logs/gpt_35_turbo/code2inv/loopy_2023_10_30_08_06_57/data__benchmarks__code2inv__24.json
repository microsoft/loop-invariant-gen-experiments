Given a program, you can find loop invariants, which can then be used to verify some property in the program. \nFrama-C is a software verification tool for C programs. The input to Frama-C is a C program file with ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations.\nFor the given program, find the necessary loop invariants of the while loop to help Frama-C verify the post-condition.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. \n- Output loop invariants that are true \n(i) before the loop execution, \n(ii) in every iteration of the loop and \n(iii) after the loop termination, \nsuch that the loop invariants imply the post condition.\n- If a loop invariant is a conjunction, split it into its parts.\n- Output all the loop invariants in one code block. For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values. Do not use variables that have garbage values.**\n- **Do not use keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops.**\n- **Variables that are not explicitly initialized, could have garbage values.

If `j` is less than `i`, then the loop has not executed, and hence `j` is still equal to 10. Therefore, the implication ensures that the loop invariant is true in all cases. \n\nWe also added loop invariants to bound the range of `i` and `j`. Since `i` is incremented by 2 in each iteration and starts at 1, its maximum value is 11. Similarly, `j` is decremented by 1 in each iteration and starts at 10, so its minimum value is 6. \n\nFinally, we added a loop invariant that ensures that the difference between `j` and `i` is always a multiple of 3.

It ensures that j is greater than or equal to i before the loop starts.\n- The second loop invariant ensures that the difference between j and i is always even. This is because in each iteration of the loop, i is increased by 2 and j is decreased by 1. Therefore, the difference between j and i will always be an odd number. However, since j is greater than or equal to i and the difference is odd, it follows that the difference must be an odd multiple of 2, i.e., even. Therefore, the loop invariant (j - i) % 2 == 0 holds true in every iteration of the loop.\n- The third loop invariant ensures that j is equal to 6 after the loop terminates. We use the implication j == i - 2 ==> j == 6, which means that if j is ever equal to i - 2 during the loop execution, then j must be equal to 6. This implication holds true because in each iteration of the loop, i is increased by 2 and j is decreased by 1. Therefore, j will be equal to i - 2 at some point during the loop execution.
