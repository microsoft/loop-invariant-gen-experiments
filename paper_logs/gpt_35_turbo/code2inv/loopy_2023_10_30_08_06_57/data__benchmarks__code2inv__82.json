The input to Frama-C is a C program file with ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations.\nFor the given program, find the necessary loop invariants of the while loop to help Frama-C verify the post-condition.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. \n- Output loop invariants that are true \n(i) before the loop execution, \n(ii) in every iteration of the loop and \n(iii) after the loop termination, \nsuch that the loop invariants imply the post condition.\n- If a loop invariant is a conjunction, split it into its parts.\n- Output all the loop invariants in one code block. For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values.

Therefore, `(i >= y)` is true.\n- The seventh invariant is true in every iteration of the loop because if `i < 0`, then the loop has executed at most `y` times, and since `i` is non-negative and less than or equal to `y`, it must also be less than `y`. Therefore, `(i < y)` is true.\n- The eighth invariant is true after the loop termination because the loop condition is false, so the loop has executed a fixed number of times, say `n`. Therefore, `i` is equal to `n` and is less than or equal to `y`. Therefore, `i` is less than or equal to the number of iterations of the loop.\n- The ninth invariant is true after the loop termination because the loop condition is false, so the loop has executed a fixed number of times, say `n`. Therefore, `i` is equal to `n` and is greater than or equal to `n - (y - x)`, which is the number of times the condition `(i < y)` is true. Therefore, `i` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations of the loop minus the number of times the condition `(i < y)` is true.",
