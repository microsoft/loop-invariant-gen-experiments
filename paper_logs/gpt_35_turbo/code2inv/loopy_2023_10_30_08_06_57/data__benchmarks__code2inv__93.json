This means that `x + y` is always equal to `3 * (i - 1)` at the end of each iteration. So, `x + y == 3 * (i - 1)` is true in every iteration of the loop.\n- After the loop termination, `i >= n` and `x + y == 3 * n`. Using the loop invariant `x + y == 3 * (i - 1)`, we can rewrite this as `x + y == 3 * (n - 1) + 3`. We know that `i <= n` is true for all iterations, so the final value of `i` is at most `n`. This means that the final value of `i` is `n` or less. If `i` is equal to `n`, then the loop terminates and `x + y == 3 * (n - 1) + 3 == 3 * n`. If `i` is less than `n`, then the loop condition fails and the loop terminates. In this case, `x + y == 3 * (i - 1) + 3 * (n - i) == 3 * n`, which is still the desired post-condition. So, the loop invariant `x + y == 3 * (i - 1)` implies the post-condition `3 * n == x + y`.",

The implication is true because the loop body updates `x` and `y` based on whether `unknown()` is true or false, and the update is deterministic.
