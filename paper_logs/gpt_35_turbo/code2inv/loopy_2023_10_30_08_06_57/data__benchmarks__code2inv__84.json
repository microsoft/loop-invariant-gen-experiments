The input to Frama-C is a C program file with ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations.\nFor the given program, find the necessary loop invariants of the while loop to help Frama-C verify the post-condition.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. \n- Output loop invariants that are true \n(i) before the loop execution, \n(ii) in every iteration of the loop and \n(iii) after the loop termination, \nsuch that the loop invariants imply the post condition.\n- If a loop invariant is a conjunction, split it into its parts.\n- Output all the loop invariants in one code block. For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values. Do not use variables that have garbage values.**\n- **Do not use keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops.**\n- **Variables that are not explicitly initialized, could have garbage values.

However, the second loop invariant only states that `y` is greater than or equal to `0`.\n- In every iteration of the loop, `x` is updated to `x + y`, which means that `x` is increasing by at least `y` in every iteration. Therefore, `x` will eventually become non-negative and the loop will terminate. This satisfies the first loop invariant.\n- In every iteration of the loop, `y` is updated to `y + 1`, which means that `y` is increasing by `1` in every iteration. Therefore, `y` will always be non-negative, satisfying the second loop invariant.\n- After the loop termination, `x` is either `0` or positive, because the loop condition is `x < 0`. Therefore, if `y` is greater than `0`, then `x` must be less than or equal to `0`.

This is because no information is given about the initial value of `y`, and `y` is incremented by `1` in each iteration of the loop, so it must always be greater than or equal to `0`. Therefore, we can write:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n*/\n```\n- In every iteration of the loop, the value of `x + y` is less than or equal to `0`.

Therefore, we have:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x + y <= 0;\n*/\n```\n- After the loop termination, `x` is greater than or equal to `0`.
