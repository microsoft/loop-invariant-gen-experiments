            "First, let's write down the pre-conditions and variable assignments in the program:\n```\nPre-conditions:\n- None\n\nVariable Assignments:\n- c = 0\n```\n\nNext, let's analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. The loop condition is `unknown()`. Since `unknown()` is a non-deterministic function, we cannot reason about the exact number of loop iterations or the value of `c` after the loop terminates. Therefore, we must come up with loop invariants that are true before the loop, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop.\n\nHere are some loop invariants that we can use:\n```\n/*@ \nloop invariant 0 <= c <= n;\nloop invariant (c == n) ==> (n <= -1);\nloop invariant (c != n) ==> (1 <= c <= n-1);\n*/\n```\n\nLet's break down the loop invariants and explain why they hold:\n- `0 <= c <= n;` - This invariant is true before the loop, and in every iteration of the loop. This is because `c` is assigned to 0 before the loop, and is incremented or reset to 1 in every iteration of the loop. Since `n` is assumed to be greater than 0, `c` must always be between 0 and `n`.\n- `(c == n) ==> (n <= -1);` - This invariant is true after the loop. Since the loop condition is `unknown()`, we cannot reason about the exact number of loop iterations. However, if `c` is equal to `n` after the loop, then the assertion is triggered. The assertion can only be true if `n` is less than or equal to -1. Therefore, this invariant holds.\n- `(c != n) ==> (1 <= c <= n-1);` - This invariant is true before the loop, and in every iteration of the loop. This is because if `c` is not equal to `n`, then it must be between 1 and `n-1`. In every iteration of the loop, `c` is either incremented or reset to 1, so it must still be between 1 and `n-1`.",
