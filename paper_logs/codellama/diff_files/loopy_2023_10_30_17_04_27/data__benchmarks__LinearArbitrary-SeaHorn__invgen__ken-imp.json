The loop invariant `y <= j` is true in every iteration of the loop, because `y` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, and `j` is not modified.\n5. The loop invariant `x == i` is true after the loop termination, because the loop terminates when `x` becomes 0, and `i` is not modified.\n6. The loop invariant `y == j` is true after the loop termination, because the loop terminates when `y` becomes 0, and `j` is not modified.\n\nTherefore, the necessary loop invariants for the while loop are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i <= x;\n    loop invariant j <= y;\n    loop invariant x <= i;\n    loop invariant y <= j;\n    loop invariant x == i;\n    loop invariant y == j;\n*/\n```\nThese loop invariants imply the post-condition `i == j` because they ensure that `x` and `y` are both 0, which means that `i` and `j` are both 0 as well."

This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as `x` is non-zero.\n3. Loop body:\nThe loop body consists of two statements: `x--` and `y--`. These statements decrease the value of `x` and `y` by 1 in each iteration of the loop.\n4. Post-condition:\nThe post-condition is `i == j`. This means that after the loop execution, the values of `i` and `j` should be equal.\n\nNow, let's find the loop invariants:\n\n1. Before the loop execution:\nThere is no loop invariant before the loop execution, as the loop is entered only if `x` is non-zero.\n2. In every iteration of the loop:\nThe loop invariant is `x >= 0 && y >= 0`. This means that `x` and `y` should be non-negative in every iteration of the loop.\n3.

Before the loop execution:\nAt the beginning of the loop, the value of `x` and `y` is not specified. However, we know that `x` is not equal to 0, otherwise the loop would not have started. So, we can say that `x` is greater than 0 before the loop execution.\n2. In every iteration of the loop:\nDuring each iteration of the loop, the value of `x` is decreased by 1, and the value of `y` is also decreased by 1. Therefore, we can say that `x` is always greater than 0, and `y` is always greater than or equal to 0 in every iteration of the loop.\n3.
