The loop body can be expressed as:\n\n```\nsn = sn + a;\nx++;\n```\n\nTo find the loop invariants, we need to analyze the loop body and the loop condition.\n\n1. **Loop Invariants:** The loop invariants are the conditions that remain true before, during, and after the loop execution.\n\na. **Before the loop execution:** The loop invariant `sn == 0` is true before the loop execution, as `sn` is initialized to `0` before the loop.\n\nb. **In every iteration of the loop:** The loop invariant `sn == x*a || sn == 0` is true in every iteration of the loop. This invariant is derived from the loop body, where `sn` is updated as `sn = sn + a`, and `x` is updated as `x++`. The invariant is true when `sn` is equal to `x*a` or `0`.\n\nc. **After the loop termination:** The loop invariant `sn == 0` is true after the loop termination, as the loop runs indefinitely and `sn` is updated as `sn = sn + a`, which will eventually reach `0`.\n\nTherefore, the necessary loop invariants for the while loop in the program are:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant sn == 0;\n    loop invariant sn == x*a || sn == 0;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have split the conjunction of loop invariants into its parts to make it easier to read and understand."
