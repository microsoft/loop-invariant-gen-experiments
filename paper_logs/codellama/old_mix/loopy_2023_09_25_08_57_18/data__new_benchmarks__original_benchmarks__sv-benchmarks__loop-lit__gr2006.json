The loop body consists of two if-else statements. The first if-else statement increments `y` by 1 if `x` is less than 50, otherwise it decrements `y` by 1. The second if-else statement breaks the loop if `y` is less than 0.\n2. The loop condition is `1`. This means the loop will execute indefinitely until the loop is broken.\n\nNow, let's identify the loop invariants.\n\n1. Before the loop execution, we have `x = 0` and `y = 0`. These are the initial values of `x` and `y`.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, we have `x <= 50` and `y >= 0`. This is because the loop body increments `y` by 1 if `x` is less than 50, and decrements `y` by 1 if `x` is greater than or equal to 50.\n3. After the loop termination, we have `x == 100` and `y == 0`. This is because the loop breaks when `y` is less than 0, and the loop increments `x` by 1 in each iteration.\n\nSo, the loop invariants are:\n\n* `x <= 50`\n* `y >= 0`\n* `x == 100`\n* `y == 0`\n\nThese loop invariants imply the post-condition `x == 100` and `y == 0`, which is the desired property of the program.",
