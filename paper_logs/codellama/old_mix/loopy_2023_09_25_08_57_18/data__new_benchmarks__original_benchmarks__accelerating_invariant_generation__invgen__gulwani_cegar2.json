Before the loop execution, `m` is equal to `0`.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, `m` is less than or equal to `x`.\n3. After the loop termination, `m` is less than or equal to `n`.\n\nTo express these loop invariants in ACSL annotations, we can use the following code block:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant m == 0;\n    loop invariant m <= x;\n    loop invariant m <= n;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used the `==` operator to indicate that `m` is equal to `0` before the loop execution, and the `<=` operator to indicate that `m` is less than or equal to `x` and `n` in every iteration of the loop and after the loop termination, respectively.\n\nAlso, note that we have not used any variables or functions that are not declared in the program, and we have not made any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given. We have also avoided using any keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."

Loop Body:\nThe loop body consists of two statements:\n```c\nif(__BLAST_NONDET)\n    m = x;\nx++;\n```\nThe first statement assigns the value of `x` to `m` if `__BLAST_NONDET` is true. The second statement increments `x` by 1.\n2. Loop Condition:\nThe loop condition is `x < n`. This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as `x` is less than `n`.\n\nNow, let's find the loop invariants:\n\n1. Before the loop execution:\nNo loop invariants are true before the loop execution.\n2. In every iteration of the loop:\nThe loop invariant `x <= m` is true in every iteration of the loop.
