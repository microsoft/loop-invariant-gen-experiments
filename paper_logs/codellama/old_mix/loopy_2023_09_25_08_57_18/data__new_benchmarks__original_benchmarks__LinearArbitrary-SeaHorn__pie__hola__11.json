The variable `x` is the loop bound, and the variable `i` is the loop index.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the loop invariants for the loop in the given program are:\n\n* Before the loop execution, `j` is equal to 0, and `i` is equal to 0.\n* During each iteration of the loop, `j` is equal to `2*i`, and `i` is less than `x`.\n* After the loop termination, `j` is equal to `2*x`, and `i` is equal to `x`.\n\nHere is the code block that specifies the loop invariants using ACSL annotations:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant j == 2*i;\n    loop invariant i < x;\n    loop invariant j == 2*x;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used the `loop invariant` keyword to specify the loop invariants. The `loop invariant` keyword is used to specify a condition that remains true before, during, and after each iteration of the loop.\n\nAlso, we have used the `==` operator to specify the equality condition between the variables. The `==` operator is used to check if two expressions are equal.\n\nIn this case, we have specified three loop invariants:\n\n* `j == 2*i`: This invariant specifies that the value of `j` is equal to twice the value of `i` before, during, and after each iteration of the loop.\n* `i < x`: This invariant specifies that the value of `i` is less than the value of `x` before, during, and after each iteration of the loop.\n* `j == 2*x`: This invariant specifies that the value of `j` is equal to twice the value of `x` after the loop termination.\n\nBy specifying these loop invariants, we can verify that the loop executes correctly and that the post-condition `j == 2*x` is satisfied after the loop termination."
