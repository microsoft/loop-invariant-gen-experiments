The first statement increments `x` by `y`, and the second statement increments `y` by 1.\n\nNow, we can identify the loop invariants. A loop invariant is a condition that is true before the loop execution, at the beginning of every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. In this case, we can identify two loop invariants:\n\n1. `x < 0`: This invariant is true before the loop execution, because `x` is initialized to -50, which is less than 0. It is also true at the beginning of every iteration of the loop, because the loop condition is `x < 0`, and the loop body increments `x` by `y`. Finally, it is true after the loop termination, because the loop will terminate when `x` is greater than or equal to 0.\n2. `y > 0`: This invariant is true before the loop execution, because `y` is initialized to a positive value returned by the `unknown()` function. It is also true at the beginning of every iteration of the loop, because the loop body increments `y` by 1. Finally, it is true after the loop termination, because the loop will terminate when `x` is greater than or equal to 0, and `y` will be greater than 0.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the while loop in the program are `x < 0` and `y > 0`. We can write these invariants in ACSL notation as follows:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant x < 0;\n    loop invariant y > 0;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have not used any variables or functions that are not declared in the program, and we have not made any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given. We have also not used any keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops."
