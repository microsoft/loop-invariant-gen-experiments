The loop body contains a single if-else statement that modifies the values of `x` and `z`. If the condition `tmp` is true, then `x` is incremented by 1. If the condition `tmp` is false, then `x` is decremented by 1 and `z` is decremented by 1.\n\nNow, let's identify the loop invariants.

This is because the loop body ensures that `x` is never decremented below 0.\n\nThe fourth loop invariant is `z>=0`, which is true before the loop starts and remains true throughout the loop execution. This is because the loop body ensures that `z` is never decremented below 0.\n\nFinally, the fifth loop invariant is `x>=100 || z<=100`, which is true after the loop terminates. This is because the loop condition \\begin{code}\nx<100 && 100<z\n\\end{code} ensures that the loop terminates when either `x` is greater than or equal to 100 or `z` is less than or equal to 100.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the loop in the given program are:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant x<100;\n    loop invariant z>100;\n    loop invariant x>=0;\n    loop invariant z>=0;\n    loop invariant x>=100 || z<=100;\n*/\n```\nNote that these loop invariants can be used to verify the post-condition of the loop, which is `x>=100 || z<=100`."
