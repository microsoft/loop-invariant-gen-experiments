We have:\n\n* `i<n` is the loop condition, which means that the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclude that the following loop invariants are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination:\n\n* `n >= 0` (pre-condition)\n* `sum` is an integer (due to the `sum=sum+i` statement)\n* `i` is an integer (due to the `i++` statement)\n* `i < n` (loop condition)\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the while loop in the given C program are:\n\n* `n >= 0`\n* `sum` is an integer\n* `i` is an integer\n* `i < n`\n\nNote that these loop invariants imply the post-condition `sum>=0`, which is the desired property that we want to verify using Frama-C.",
