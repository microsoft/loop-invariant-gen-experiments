The loop condition is `i < 10`.\n\nThe loop invariants are the properties that are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. These properties can be used to verify the post-condition of the loop.\n\nBased on the loop body and the loop condition, we can identify the following loop invariants:\n\n1. `i >= 0`: This invariant is true before the loop execution, as the variable `i` is initialized to 0. It is also true in every iteration of the loop, as the loop body increments `i` by 1 in each iteration. Finally, it is true after the loop termination, as the loop terminates when `i` reaches 10, which is greater than or equal to 0.\n2. `x >= 0`: This invariant is true before the loop execution, as the variable `x` is initialized to a non-negative value. It is also true in every iteration of the loop, as the loop body does not modify the value of `x`. Finally, it is true after the loop termination, as the loop terminates when `i` reaches 10, which is greater than or equal to 0.\n3. `y > 2`: This invariant is true before the loop execution, as the variable `y` is initialized to a value greater than 2. It is also true in every iteration of the loop, as the loop body does not modify the value of `y`. Finally, it is true after the loop termination, as the loop terminates when `i` reaches 10, which is greater than 2.\n\nTherefore, the necessary loop invariants for the while loop in the given program are `i >= 0`, `x >= 0`, and `y > 2`. These loop invariants can be used to verify the post-condition of the loop, which is `x <= -1`."
