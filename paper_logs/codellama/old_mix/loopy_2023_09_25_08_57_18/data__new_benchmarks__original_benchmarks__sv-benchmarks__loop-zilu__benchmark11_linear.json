This statement increments the value of `x` by 1 in each iteration of the loop.\n\nLoop Condition:\nThe loop condition is `x<n`. This condition checks whether the value of `x` is less than the value of `n`. If the condition is true, the loop continues to execute. Otherwise, the loop terminates.\n\nLoop Invariants:\nBased on the loop body and the loop condition, we can derive the following loop invariants:\n\n1. Before the loop execution, `x` is less than `n`. This is because the loop condition is `x<n`, and the loop only executes if this condition is true.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, `x` is less than `n`. This is because the loop body increments the value of `x` by 1 in each iteration, and the loop condition checks whether `x` is less than `n`.\n3. After the loop termination, `x` is equal to `n`. This is because the loop terminates when `x` is greater than or equal to `n`, and the loop body increments the value of `x` by 1 in each iteration.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the loop in the program above are:\n\n* `x < n` before the loop execution\n* `x < n` in every iteration of the loop\n* `x == n` after the loop termination\n\nNote that these loop invariants are based on the assumption that `x` and `n` are non-negative integers.
