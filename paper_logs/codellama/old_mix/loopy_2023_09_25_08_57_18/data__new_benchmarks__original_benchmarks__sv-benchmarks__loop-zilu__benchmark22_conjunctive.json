A loop invariant is a condition that remains true before, during, and after the loop execution.\n\nBefore the loop execution, we have `x == 1 && y == 0`. This is because the loop condition is `unknown_bool()`, which is a function that returns a boolean value. If the function returns `true`, the loop body will be executed, and the loop invariants will be maintained.\n\nDuring the loop execution, we have `x >= y`. This is because the loop body increments `x` by `y` and increments `y` by 1. Therefore, `x` will always be greater than or equal to `y`.\n\nAfter the loop termination, we have `x >= y`. This is because the loop condition is `unknown_bool()`, which is a function that returns a boolean value. If the function returns `false`, the loop body will not be executed, and the loop invariants will still be maintained.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the loop in the program are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= y;\n    loop invariant x == 1 && y == 0;\n*/\n```\nNote that the loop invariants are true before, during, and after the loop execution. The loop invariants imply the post-condition `x >= y`, which is the desired property that we want to verify."
