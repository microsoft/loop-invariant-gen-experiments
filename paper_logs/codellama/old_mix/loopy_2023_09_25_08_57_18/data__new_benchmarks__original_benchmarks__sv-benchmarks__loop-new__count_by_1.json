We also need to identify the conditions that are true after the loop terminates.\n\nHere are the loop invariants for the loop in the program:\n\n1. Before the loop starts, `i == 0` is true. This is because the loop starts with `i = 0`.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, `i` is less than `LARGE_INT`. This is because the loop condition is `i < LARGE_INT`.\n3. After the loop terminates, `i == LARGE_INT` is true. This is because the loop will continue to execute until `i` is equal to `LARGE_INT`, and then the loop will terminate.\n\nSo, the loop invariants for the loop in the program are:\n\n* `i == 0` (before the loop starts)\n* `i < LARGE_INT` (in every iteration of the loop)\n* `i == LARGE_INT` (after the loop terminates)\n\nNote that these loop invariants do not mention any variables that are not declared in the program. They also do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given. Finally, they do not use any keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops.",
