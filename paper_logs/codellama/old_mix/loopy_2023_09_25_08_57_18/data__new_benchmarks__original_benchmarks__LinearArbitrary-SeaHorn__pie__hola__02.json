We know that the loop variable `z` is incremented by `x+y+w` at the end of each iteration, and `y` is incremented by 1. We also know that `w` is incremented by 2.\n\nFinally, let's think about what we want to prove about the loop. In this case, we want to prove that `x` is equal to `y`.\n\nWith this information, we can start identifying some loop invariants. A loop invariant is a condition that is true before each iteration of the loop, and remains true after each iteration.\n\nHere are some potential loop invariants for this loop:\n\n* `z` is equal to `i-j`\n* `x` is equal to `y`\n* `w` is equal to 2 times the number of iterations\n\nWe can use these loop invariants to prove that `x` is equal to `y` after the loop terminates. For example, if the loop terminates after `n` iterations, we know that `z` is equal to `i-j+n(x+y+w)`, and `w` is equal to 2 times `n`. We can substitute these values into the equation `x=y` to get `i-j+n(x+y+w)=y`, which simplifies to `x=y`.\n\nTherefore, we have proven that `x` is equal to `y` after the loop terminates, using the loop invariants `z` is equal to `i-j`, `x` is equal to `y`, and `w` is equal to 2 times the number of iterations."
