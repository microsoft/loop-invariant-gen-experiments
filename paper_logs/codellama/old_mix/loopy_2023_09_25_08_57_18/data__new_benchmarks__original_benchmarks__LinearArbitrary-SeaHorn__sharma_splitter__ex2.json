The second if-else statement sets z to z+1 if x is less than 25, and sets z to z+5 if x is greater than or equal to 25. Finally, the third if-else statement increments x by 1.\n2. Loop Condition:\nThe loop condition is x < 100.\n\nNow, let's find the loop invariants:\n\n1. Before the loop execution:\nThere are no loop invariants that are true before the loop execution.\n2.

This means that the loop will execute until `x` is equal to or greater than 100.\n\nIn the loop body, there are three statements that affect the variables `x`, `y`, and `z`. The statements are:\n```\nif(x<=50)\n\ty=y+1;\nelse\n\ty=y-1;\n\nif(x<25)\n\tz=z+1;\nelse\n\tz=z+5;\n\nx=x+1;\n```\nWe can see that the loop body modifies the variables `x`, `y`, and `z`. The first statement in the loop body is an if-else statement that modifies `y`. If `x` is less than or equal to 50, `y` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `y` is decremented by 1.\n\nThe second statement in the loop body is another if-else statement that modifies `z`. If `x` is less than 25, `z` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `z` is incremented by 5.\n\nThe third statement in the loop body is `x=x+1`, which increments `x` by 1.\n\nNow, let's think about the loop invariants. A loop invariant is a condition that remains true before, during, and after the execution of the loop. In other words, it is a condition that is true before the loop starts, and it remains true after the loop terminates.\n\nTo find the loop invariants, we need to identify the conditions that remain true before, during, and after the loop execution. Let's analyze the loop body and the loop condition to find the loop invariants.\n\nThe loop body modifies the variables `x`, `y`, and `z`. The first statement in the loop body modifies `y`, the second statement modifies `z`, and the third statement modifies `x`.\n\nBefore the loop starts, the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` are initialized to 0. So, the loop invariant before the loop starts is `x == 0 && y == 0 && z == 0`.\n\nDuring the loop execution, the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` are modified based on the loop body statements. The loop invariant during the loop execution is `x <= 100 && y <= 2 && z <= 400`.\n\nAfter the loop terminates, the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` are modified based on the loop body statements. The loop invariant after the loop termination is `x == 100 && y == 2 && z == 400`.\n\nSo, the loop invariants for the loop in the program are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x == 0 && y == 0 && z == 0;\n    loop invariant x <= 100 && y <= 2 && z <= 400;\n    loop invariant x == 100 && y == 2 && z == 400;\n*/\n```\nThese loop invariants imply the post-condition of the loop, which is `z == 400`."
