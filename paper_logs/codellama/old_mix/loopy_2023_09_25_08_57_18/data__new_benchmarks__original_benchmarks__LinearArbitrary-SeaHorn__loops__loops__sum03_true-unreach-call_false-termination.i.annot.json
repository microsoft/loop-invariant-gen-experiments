In this case, the variable `sn` is modified inside the loop, while the variable `x` is not modified.\n\nThe loop invariant for the loop can be written as:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant sn == x*(2) || sn == 0;\n*/\n```\nThis loop invariant is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. It implies that the post-condition `sn == x*(2) || sn == 0` is true after the loop termination.\n\nNote that we have used the `sn == x*(2) || sn == 0` condition as the loop invariant, which is a conjunction of two conditions. We have split the conjunction into its parts and used each part as a separate loop invariant. This is allowed in ACSL annotations for loops."
