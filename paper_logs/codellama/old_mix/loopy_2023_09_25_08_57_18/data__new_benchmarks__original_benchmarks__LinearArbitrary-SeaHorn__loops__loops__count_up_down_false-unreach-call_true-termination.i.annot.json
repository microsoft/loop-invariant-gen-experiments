Before the loop execution:\nThe loop invariant `x > 0` is true before the loop execution, since it is the pre-condition of the loop.\n2.

After the loop termination:\nThe loop invariant `x > 0` is also true after the loop termination, since the loop condition is `x > 0`, and the loop terminates when `x` is 0.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants that imply the post condition `y != n` are:\n\n* `x > 0`\n* `y > 0`\n\nThese loop invariants are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination, and they imply the post condition `y != n`.\n\nNote that we have not used any variables or functions that are not declared in the program, and we have not made any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.
