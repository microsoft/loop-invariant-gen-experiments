The first if-else statement sets x to 2 if x is equal to 1, and the second if-else statement sets x to 1 if x is not equal to 1.\n\nLoop Condition:\nThe loop condition is i<N, where i is the loop counter and N is the loop bound.\n\nLoop Invariants:\n\n1. i >= 0: This invariant is true before the loop execution, as the loop counter i is initialized to 0.\n2. x >= 1: This invariant is true before the loop execution, as the variable x is initialized to 1.\n3. i < N: This invariant is true in every iteration of the loop, as the loop condition ensures that i is less than N.\n4. x <= 2: This invariant is true in every iteration of the loop, as the loop body ensures that x is either set to 1 or 2.\n5. x > 2: This invariant is false after the loop termination, as the loop body ensures that x is never set to a value greater than 2.\n\nTherefore, the necessary loop invariants for the while loop in the program above are:\n\n* i >= 0\n* x >= 1\n* i < N\n* x <= 2\n* x > 2\n\nNote that the last invariant is negated, as it is a post-condition that needs to be verified.",
