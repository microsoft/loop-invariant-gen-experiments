Loop Body:\nThe loop body consists of two if-else statements. The first if-else statement checks if `unknown1()` returns a non-zero value. If it does, the variable `a` is incremented. Otherwise, the variable `a` is decremented. The second if-else statement checks if `unknown1()` returns a non-zero value again. If it does, the variable `a` is incremented. Otherwise, the variable `a` is decremented.\n2. Loop Condition:\nThe loop condition is `j <= m`. This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as the variable `j` is less than or equal to the variable `m`.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can identify the following loop invariants:\n\n1. Before the loop execution, the variable `a` is initialized to 0.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, the variable `a` is either incremented or decremented.\n3. After the loop termination, the variable `a` is greater than or equal to -`m` and less than or equal to `m`.\n\nThe loop invariants imply the post-condition that the variable `a` is greater than or equal to -`m` and less than or equal to `m`.\n\nHere are the loop invariants in code block format:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant a == 0;\n    loop invariant a == a + 1 || a == a - 1;\n    loop invariant a >= -m && a <= m;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have assumed that the variables `m` and `j` are initialized to non-negative values. Also, we have used the `assume` macro to specify the pre-conditions and variable assignments in the program."

Loop body: The loop body consists of two statements: `a++` and `a--`. These statements increment or decrement the variable `a` by 1.\n2. Loop condition: The loop condition is `j <= m`. This condition checks whether the loop variable `j` is less than or equal to the loop bound `m`.\n\nBased on the loop body and the loop condition, we can infer the following loop invariants:\n\n1. Before the loop execution, `a` is equal to 0.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, `a` is incremented or decremented by 1.\n3. After the loop termination, `a` is greater than or equal to -`m` and less than or equal to `m`.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the loop in the program above are:\n\n* `a == 0`\n* `a >= -m`\n* `a <= m`\n\nNote that we have used the pre-condition `m > 0` to infer the loop invariants.
