It ensures that the loop will not access any negative indices in the array.\n3. `sn == i*a || sn == 0`: This invariant is true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop. It ensures that the value of `sn` is equal to the sum of `a` and the previous value of `sn`, or it is equal to 0.\n\nBy using these loop invariants, Frama-C can verify the post-condition of the program, which is `sn == n*a || sn == 0`."

                "content": " To find the necessary loop invariants for the while loop in the program, we need to analyze the loop body and the loop condition.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the loop condition. The loop condition is `i <= n`. This means that the loop will execute at most `n` times, and the loop will terminate when `i > n`.\n\nNext, let's analyze the loop body. The loop body contains two statements: `sn = sn + a` and `j--`. The first statement increments `sn` by `a` each time the loop executes, and the second statement decreases `j` by 1 each time the loop executes.\n\nNow, let's find the loop invariants. A loop invariant is a condition that is true before the loop executes, is true after each iteration of the loop, and is true after the loop terminates.\n\nBased on the loop condition and the loop body, we can find the following loop invariants:\n\n1. `sn <= n*a`: This invariant is true before the loop executes because `sn` is initialized to 0, and `n*a` is the maximum value that `sn` can reach in the loop. This invariant is also true after each iteration of the loop because `sn` is incremented by `a` each time the loop executes, and `n*a` is the maximum value that `sn` can reach in the loop. Finally, this invariant is true after the loop terminates because `sn` will be equal to `n*a` if the loop executes `n` times.\n2. `j >= 0`: This invariant is true before the loop executes because `j` is initialized to 10, and it is decreased by 1 each time the loop executes. This invariant is also true after each iteration of the loop because `j` is decreased by 1 each time the loop executes, and it will be equal to 0 after the loop terminates.\n\nTherefore, the necessary loop invariants for the while loop in the program are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant sn <= n*a;\n    loop invariant j >= 0;\n*/\n```\nThese loop invariants imply the post-condition `sn == n*a || sn == 0`, which means that the loop will terminate with `sn` equal to `n*a` if the loop executes `n` times, or with `sn` equal to 0 if the loop does not execute `n` times."
