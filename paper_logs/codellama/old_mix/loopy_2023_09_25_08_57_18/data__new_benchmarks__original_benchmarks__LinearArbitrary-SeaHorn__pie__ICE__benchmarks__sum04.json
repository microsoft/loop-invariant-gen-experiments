If it is, the loop continues to execute.\n\nBased on this information, we can identify the following loop invariants:\n\n1. Before the loop execution, `sn` is equal to 0.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, `sn` is equal to `sn` + `a`.\n3. After the loop termination, `sn` is equal to `SIZE` \\* `a` or 0.\n\nThese loop invariants imply the post-condition `sn == SIZE * a || sn == 0`.\n\nHere is the code block with the loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant sn == 0;\n  loop invariant sn == sn + a;\n  loop invariant sn == SIZE * a || sn == 0;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used the `assume` macro to define the pre-condition `sn == 0`. We have also used the `SIZE` macro to define the loop condition `i <= SIZE`."

The loop condition is `i <= SIZE`, which means that the loop will iterate while `i` is less than or equal to `SIZE`.\n\nNext, let's analyze the loop body. The loop body consists of a single statement: `sn = sn + a;`. This statement increments the value of `sn` by `a` in each iteration of the loop.\n\nNow, let's identify the loop invariants. A loop invariant is a condition that is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. In this case, we need to find the loop invariants that imply the post-condition `sn == SIZE*a || sn == 0`.\n\nHere are the loop invariants for the loop in the program above:\n\n1. `sn >= 0`\n2. `sn <= SIZE*a`\n3. `i <= SIZE`\n\nThe first invariant `sn >= 0` is true before the loop execution because `sn` is initialized to 0. It is also true in every iteration of the loop because `sn` is only incremented by `a`, which is a positive value. Finally, it is true after the loop termination because the loop will terminate when `i` exceeds `SIZE`, which means that `sn` will be equal to `SIZE*a` or `0`.\n\nThe second invariant `sn <= SIZE*a` is true before the loop execution because `sn` is initialized to 0. It is also true in every iteration of the loop because `sn` is only incremented by `a`, which is a positive value. Finally, it is true after the loop termination because the loop will terminate when `i` exceeds `SIZE`, which means that `sn` will be equal to `SIZE*a` or `0`.\n\nThe third invariant `i <= SIZE` is true before the loop execution because `i` is initialized to 1. It is also true in every iteration of the loop because `i` is only incremented by 1. Finally, it is true after the loop termination because the loop will terminate when `i` exceeds `SIZE`, which means that `i` will be equal to `SIZE+1`.\n\nThese loop invariants imply the post-condition `sn == SIZE*a || sn == 0` because they ensure that `sn` will be equal to `SIZE*a` or `0` after the loop termination. Specifically, if `sn >= 0` and `sn <= SIZE*a`, then `sn == SIZE*a || sn == 0` because `SIZE*a` is the maximum value that `sn` can take. Similarly, if `i <= SIZE`, then `sn == SIZE*a || sn == 0` because the loop will terminate when `i` exceeds `SIZE`, which means that `sn` will be equal to `SIZE*a` or `0`.",
