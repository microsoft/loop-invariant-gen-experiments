The loop body is empty, and the loop increments `i` by `k` in each iteration.\n\nTo find the loop invariants, we need to identify the conditions that are true before the loop starts, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop terminates.\n\nHere are the loop invariants for the loop in the program:\n\n1. Before the loop starts: `i == 0`\n2. In every iteration of the loop: `0 <= i < LARGE_INT*k`\n3. After the loop terminates: `i == LARGE_INT*k`\n\nThese loop invariants imply the post-condition `i == LARGE_INT*k`, which is the assertion at the end of the loop.\n\nNote that we have used the `assume` macro to ensure that the loop condition is satisfied, and we have used the `unknown_int` function to initialize the variable `k` to a value between 0 and 10. The `LARGE_INT` constant is defined as 1000000, and we have used it to calculate the loop bound.",
