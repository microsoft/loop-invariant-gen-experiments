Before the loop execution:\nThere are no loop invariants that are true before the loop execution.\n2. In every iteration of the loop:\nThe loop invariants that are true in every iteration of the loop are:\n* `x <= n`: This is true because `x` is incremented by 1 in every iteration, and `n` is a constant.\n* `y <= m`: This is true because `y` is only incremented if `x` is greater than `m`, and `m` is a constant.\n3. After the loop termination:\nThe loop invariants that are true after the loop termination are:\n* `x == n`: This is true because the loop condition is `x<n`, and the loop will terminate when `x` is equal to `n`.\n* `y == n`: This is true because the loop body increments `y` by 1 for each iteration where `x` is greater than `m`, and `m` is less than `n`.\n\nTherefore, the necessary loop invariants for the while loop to help Frama-C verify the post-condition are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x <= n;\n    loop invariant y <= m;\n    loop invariant x == n;\n    loop invariant y == n;\n*/\n```\nNote that these loop invariants are sufficient to prove the post-condition `y==n`, but they may not be necessary for other properties of the program."
