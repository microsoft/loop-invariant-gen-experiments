Loop condition:\nThe loop condition is `x > 0`, which means that the loop will continue to execute as long as `x` is greater than 0.\n4.

After the loop termination:\nThe loop invariant after the loop termination is `y == n`. This invariant is true because the post-condition for the loop is `y == n`.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the loop in the given C program are:\n\n* `x > 0` (before the loop execution)\n* `x > 0` (in every iteration of the loop)\n* `y == n` (after the loop termination)\n\nNote that these loop invariants imply the post-condition `y == n`, which means that the loop verifies the post-condition."
