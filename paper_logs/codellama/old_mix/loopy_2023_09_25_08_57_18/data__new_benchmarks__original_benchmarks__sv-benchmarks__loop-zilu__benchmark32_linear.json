Let's go through the steps to find the loop invariants for the while loop in the given C program.\n\nStep 1: Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n\nIn this program, the pre-conditions are:\n\n* `x` is assigned the value of `unknown_int()`\n* `x` is either 1 or 2\n\nStep 2: Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition.\n\nThe loop condition is `unknown_bool()`.\n\nStep 3: Output loop invariants that are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination, such that the loop invariants imply the post condition.\n\nThe post condition is `x <= 8`. To find the loop invariants, we need to analyze the loop body and identify the variables that are modified within the loop.\n\nIn this program, the only variable that is modified within the loop is `x`. The loop body consists of two if-else statements that swap the values of `x` and `y`. Therefore, the loop invariants must ensure that `x` remains either 1 or 2, and `y` remains either 1 or 2.\n\nHere are the loop invariants that we can identify:\n\n* Before the loop execution, `x` is either 1 or 2.\n* In every iteration of the loop, `x` remains either 1 or 2.\n* After the loop termination, `x` is either 1 or 2.\n\nTo express these loop invariants in ACSL annotations, we can use the following code block:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x == 1 || x == 2;\n    loop invariant y == 1 || y == 2;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have not used any variables or functions that are not declared in the program, and we have not made any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given. Additionally, we have not used any keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops."

Before the loop execution:\nThere is no loop invariant that is true before the loop execution.\n2. In every iteration of the loop:\nThe loop invariant `x==1 || x==2` is true in every iteration of the loop. This is because the loop body sets `x` to `2` if `x` is currently `1`, and sets `x` to `1` if `x` is currently `2`. Therefore, `x` is always equal to either `1` or `2` in every iteration of the loop.\n3. After the loop termination:\nThe loop invariant `x<=8` is true after the loop termination. This is because the loop body only sets `x` to `2` if `x` is currently `1`, and sets `x` to `1` if `x` is currently `2`. Therefore, `x` can only be equal to `1`, `2`, or `8` after the loop termination.\n\nHere are the loop invariants that we have found:\n\n* `x==1 || x==2` (in every iteration of the loop)\n* `x<=8` (after the loop termination)\n\nNote that we have not used any variables or functions that are not declared in the program.
