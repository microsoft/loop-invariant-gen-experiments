Loop body:\nThe loop body consists of four statements:\n```\nx = x-y;\n{;//@ assert(x==0);\n}\ny = unknown_int();\nassume(y!=0);\nx = x+y;\n{;//@ assert(x!=0);\n}\n```\nThe first statement `x = x-y` subtracts `y` from `x`. The second statement `{;//@ assert(x==0);}` asserts that `x` is equal to 0 after the subtraction.\n\nThe third statement `y = unknown_int()` assigns a new value to `y` using the `unknown_int` function. The fourth statement `assume(y!=0)` asserts that `y` is not equal to 0.\n\nThe fifth statement `x = x+y` adds `y` to `x`. The sixth statement `{;//@ assert(x!=0);}` asserts that `x` is not equal to 0 after the addition.\n\n1. Loop invariants:\nBased on the analysis of the loop body, we can identify the following loop invariants:\n* Before the loop execution, `x` is equal to 0.\n* In every iteration of the loop, `x` is not equal to 0.\n* After the loop termination, `x` is equal to 0.\n\nHere are the loop invariants in ACSL notation:\n```\n/*@\n  loop invariant i1;\n  loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nNote that the loop invariants are based on the analysis of the loop body and the loop condition. We have not made any assumptions about the `unknown_int` function or the `assume` keyword."

A loop invariant is a condition that is true before the loop execution, and remains true in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nBased on the loop body and the loop condition, we can identify the following loop invariants:\n\n1. `x` is equal to `0` before the loop execution.\n2. `y` is not equal to `0` before the loop execution.\n3. `x` is not equal to `0` after the loop termination.\n\nTo express these loop invariants in ACSL annotations, we can use the following code block:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant x == 0;\n    loop invariant y != 0;\n    loop invariant x != 0;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have split the loop invariants into separate lines for better readability. Also, we have used the `==` and `!=` operators to compare the values of `x` and `y`, respectively.\n\nFinally, we can use these loop invariants to verify the post-condition of the loop, which is `x == 0` after the loop termination."
