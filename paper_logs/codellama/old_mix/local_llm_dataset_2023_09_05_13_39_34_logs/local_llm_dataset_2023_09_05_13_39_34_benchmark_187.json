The second loop invariant states that `m` is less than `N`.\n\nThese loop invariants imply the post-condition `N > 0`, which means that if the loop terminates, then `N` is positive.\n\nNote that we have not used any variables or functions that are not declared in the program, and we have not made any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given. We have also not used any keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops."
