The loop body consists of a series of `if` statements that update the values of `v3`, `v4`, `i`, `j`, and `k` based on the value of `l`. The loop condition is `l < n`, where `n` is a user-inputted value.\n\nTo find the loop invariants, we need to identify the variables that are modified within the loop body and their relationships with the loop condition.\n\n1. The loop invariant `i` is true before the loop execution, since `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.\n2. The loop invariant `j` is true before the loop execution, since `j` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.\n3. The loop invariant `k` is true before the loop execution, since `k` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.\n4.

The loop invariant `l` is true before the loop execution, since `l` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.\n7. The loop invariant `n` is true before the loop execution, since `n` is a user-inputted value that is not modified within the loop body.\n\nIn each iteration of the loop, the following invariants are maintained:\n\n1. `i` is incremented by 1 if `l` is divisible by 3.\n2. `j` is incremented by 1 if `l` is divisible by 2.\n3. `k` is incremented by 1 if `l` is not divisible by 3 or 2.\n4. `v3` is incremented by 1 if `l` is divisible by 5.\n5. `v4` is incremented by 1 if `l` is divisible by 4.\n6. `l` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the loop in the program are:\n\n1. `i` is true before the loop execution, and it is incremented by 1 if `l` is divisible by 3.\n2. `j` is true before the loop execution, and it is incremented by 1 if `l` is divisible by 2.\n3. `k` is true before the loop execution, and it is incremented by 1 if `l` is not divisible by 3 or 2.\n4. `v3` is true before the loop execution, and it is incremented by 1 if `l` is divisible by 5.\n5. `v4` is true before the loop execution, and it is incremented by 1 if `l` is divisible by 4.\n6. `l` is true before the loop execution, and it is incremented by 1 in each iteration.\n7. `n` is true before the loop execution, and it is not modified within the loop body.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the loop in the program are:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n    loop invariant i3;\n    loop invariant i4;\n    loop invariant i5;\n    loop invariant i6;\n    loop invariant i7;\n*/\n```\nNote that the loop invariants are not necessarily the same as the pre-conditions or post-conditions of the loop.
