Loop Body:\nThe loop body consists of two if statements:\n```\nif (x>50) x++;\nif (x == 0) { x ++;\n} else x--;\n```\nFrom this, we can see that the loop body modifies the value of `x` in two ways:\n\n* If `x` is greater than 50, it is incremented by 1.\n* If `x` is equal to 0, it is incremented by 1. Otherwise, it is decremented by 1.\n2. Loop Condition:\nThe loop condition is `unknown_bool()`. This means that the loop will continue executing as long as the function `unknown_bool()` returns true.\n\nNow, let's find the loop invariants:\n\n1. Before the loop execution, the loop invariant should be true. In this case, the loop invariant should be `x >= 0 && x <= 50`. This is because the loop condition is `unknown_bool()`, which means that the loop will continue executing as long as the function returns true.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, the loop invariant should be true. In this case, the loop invariant should be `x >= 0 && x <= 50`. This is because the loop body modifies the value of `x` in a way that preserves the loop invariant.\n3. After the loop termination, the loop invariant should be true. In this case, the loop invariant should be `x >= 0 && x <= 50`. This is because the loop body modifies the value of `x` in a way that preserves the loop invariant.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the while loop in the given C program are:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nWhere `i1` is `x >= 0 && x <= 50` and `i2` is `unknown_bool()`."
