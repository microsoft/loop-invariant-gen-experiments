This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.\n\nNow, let's think about the loop invariants. A loop invariant is a property that is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. In this case, we need to find the loop invariants that imply the post-condition `i == k && k == n`.\n\nHere are some possible loop invariants:\n\n1. `i <= n`: This invariant is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. It implies that `i` is less than or equal to `n`, which is the condition for the loop to continue executing.\n2. `k <= n`: This invariant is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. It implies that `k` is less than or equal to `n`, which is the condition for the loop to continue executing.\n3. `i + k <= n`: This invariant is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. It implies that the sum of `i` and `k` is less than or equal to `n`, which is the condition for the loop to continue executing.\n\nNow, let's analyze the post-condition `i == k && k == n`. This post-condition is true after the loop termination, but it is not a loop invariant. However, we can use the loop invariants to prove that the post-condition is true.\n\nIf the loop invariants `i <= n` and `k <= n` are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination, then we can deduce that `i == k` is true after the loop termination. This is because if `i` and `k` are both less than or equal to `n`, then their sum `i + k` is also less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, if `i + k == n`, then `i == k`.\n\nSimilarly, if the loop invariant `i + k <= n` is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination, then we can deduce that `k == n` is true after the loop termination. This is because if `i + k` is less than or equal to `n`, then `k` must be equal to `n`.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the loop invariants `i <= n`, `k <= n`, and `i + k <= n` imply the post-condition `i == k && k == n`.\n\nHere are the loop invariants in ACSL notation:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant i <= n;\n    loop invariant k <= n;\n    loop invariant i + k <= n;\n*/\n```"

We can do this by considering the pre-conditions and post-conditions of the loop.\n\nPre-conditions:\n\n* `i == 0`\n* `k == 0`\n* `n > 0`\n\nPost-conditions:\n\n* `i == k`\n* `k == n`\n\nFrom the pre-conditions and post-conditions, we can infer that the loop invariants are:\n\n* `i <= n`\n* `k <= n`\n* `i + k <= 2*n`\n\nThese loop invariants are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the while loop in the given program are:\n\n```c\n/*@ loop invariant i <= n;\n    loop invariant k <= n;\n    loop invariant i + k <= 2*n;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have not used any variables or functions that are not declared in the program, and we have not made any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given. We have also avoided using non-deterministic function calls and the `\\at(x, Pre)` notation."
