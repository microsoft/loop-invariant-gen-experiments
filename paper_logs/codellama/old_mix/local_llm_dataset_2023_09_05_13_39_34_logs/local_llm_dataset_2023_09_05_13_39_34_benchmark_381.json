Loop body:\nThe loop body consists of three statements:\n```c\ni = i + 3;\nif(i%2)\n    j = j+3;\nelse\n    k = k+3;\n```\nThe loop body increments `i` by 3, and if `i` is odd, it increments `j` by 3, otherwise it increments `k` by 3.\n3. Loop condition:\nThe loop condition is `i < n`.\n4. Post-condition:\nThe post-condition is that the loop terminates with `i >= n`.\n\nNow, let's find the necessary loop invariants to verify the post-condition:\n\n(i) Before the loop execution:\nThe loop invariant before the loop execution is that `i` is less than `n`. This is the pre-condition.\n```c\n/*@ loop invariant i < n; */\n```\n(ii) In every iteration of the loop:\nThe loop invariant in every iteration of the loop is that `i` is less than `n` and `i` is odd. This is because the loop body increments `i` by 3, and if `i` is odd, it increments `j` by 3, otherwise it increments `k` by 3.\n```c\n/*@ loop invariant i < n && i % 2; */\n```\n(iii) After the loop termination:\nThe loop invariant after the loop termination is that `i` is greater than or equal to `n`. This is the post-condition.\n```c\n/*@ loop invariant i >= n; */\n```\nSo, the necessary loop invariants for the while loop in the given program are:\n```c\n/*@ loop invariant i < n;\n    loop invariant i < n && i % 2;\n    loop invariant i >= n; */\n```"

Before the loop execution, `i` is initialized to 0, and `j` and `k` are initialized to 0.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, `i` is incremented by 3, and either `j` or `k` is incremented by 3, depending on the parity of `i`.\n3. After the loop termination, `i` is equal to `n`, and `j` and `k` are equal to `n/2` and `n/2` respectively, if `n` is even, or `n/2 + 1` and `n/2 - 1` respectively, if `n` is odd.\n\nNote that these loop invariants imply the post-condition `(i/2<=j)`, which is asserted in the loop body.\n\nHere is the code block that specifies the loop invariants:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant i1: i == 0 && j == 0 && k == 0;\n    loop invariant i2: i%2 == 0 || i%2 == 1;\n    loop invariant i3: i <= n;\n    loop invariant i4: j == n/2 || k == n/2;\n*/\n```\nNote that the loop invariants are specified using the `@` notation, which is used to indicate the start of an ACSL annotation. The `loop invariant` keyword is used to indicate that the following expression is a loop invariant. The `i1`, `i2`, `i3`, and `i4` identifiers are used to refer to the loop invariants in the annotation."
