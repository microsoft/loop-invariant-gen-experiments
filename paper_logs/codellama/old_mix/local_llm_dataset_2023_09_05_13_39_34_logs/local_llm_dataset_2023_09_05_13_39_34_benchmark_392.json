Therefore, the loop invariant that is true before the loop execution is:\n```\ni == 0 && j == 0\n```\nNow, let's find the loop invariant that is true in every iteration of the loop.\n\nThe loop body consists of three statements:\n\n1. `if(!(l%2)) i = i + 1;`\n2. `else j = j+1;`\n3. `l = l+1;`\n\nThe first statement increments `i` by 1 if `l` is even, and the second statement increments `j` by 1 if `l` is odd. Therefore, the loop invariant that is true in every iteration of the loop is:\n```\ni == l/2 && j == (l-1)/2\n```\nNote that `l/2` and `(l-1)/2` are the number of even and odd numbers in the range `[0, l-1]`, respectively.\n\nFinally, let's find the loop invariant that is true after the loop termination.\n\nAfter the loop termination, the variable `l` is equal to `n`, and the variables `i` and `j` are equal to the number of even and odd numbers in the range `[0, n-1]`, respectively. Therefore, the loop invariant that is true after the loop termination is:\n```\ni == (n-1)/2 && j == (n-1)/2\n```\nNow, we can write the loop invariants in the ACSL format:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i == 0 && j == 0;\n    loop invariant i == l/2 && j == (l-1)/2;\n    loop invariant i == (n-1)/2 && j == (n-1)/2;\n*/\n```\nNote that the loop invariants are in the format of ACSL annotations, which can be used by Frama-C to verify the post-condition of the program."
