This is because the loop body asserts that `glob2_p_off` is non-negative.\n\n(ii) In every iteration of the loop, the variable `glob2_p_off` is less than `MAXPATHLEN + 1`. This is because the loop body asserts that `glob2_p_off` is less than `MAXPATHLEN + 1`, and the loop condition checks whether `glob2_p_off` is less than or equal to `glob2_pathlim_off`, which is a variable that is assigned in the loop body.\n\n(iii) After the loop termination, the variable `glob2_p_off` is equal to `glob2_pathlim_off`. This is because the loop body assigns the value of `glob2_pathlim_off` to `glob2_p_off`, and the loop condition checks whether `glob2_p_off` is less than or equal to `glob2_pathlim_off`.\n\nTherefore, the necessary loop invariants for the while loop are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= glob2_p_off;\n    loop invariant glob2_p_off < MAXPATHLEN + 1;\n    loop invariant glob2_p_off == glob2_pathlim_off;\n*/\n```"
