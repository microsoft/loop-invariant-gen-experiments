The second statement asserts that `glob2_p_off` is less than `MAXPATHLEN + 1`.\n\nThe loop condition is `glob2_p_off <= glob2_pathlim_off`.\n\nBased on the loop body and the loop condition, we can infer the following loop invariants:\n\n1. Before the loop execution, `glob2_p_off` is greater than or equal to 0.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, `glob2_p_off` is less than `MAXPATHLEN + 1`.\n3. After the loop termination, `glob2_p_off` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `MAXPATHLEN + 1`.\n\nWe can express these loop invariants in ACSL annotations as follows:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant glob2_p_off >= 0;\n    loop invariant glob2_p_off < MAXPATHLEN + 1;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have assumed that `MAXPATHLEN` is a constant and not a variable. If `MAXPATHLEN` is a variable, we would need to add additional loop invariants to account for the possibility that it may change during the execution of the loop."
