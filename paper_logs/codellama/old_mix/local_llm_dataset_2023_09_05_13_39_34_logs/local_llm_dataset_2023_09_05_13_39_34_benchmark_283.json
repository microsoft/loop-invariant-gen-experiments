In this case, the loop body is:\n```scss\nfor (i = 0; i < ielen && bufsize > 2; i++) {\n    p += 2;\n}\n```\nThe loop condition is the condition that must be true for the loop to continue executing. In this case, the loop condition is:\n```scss\ni < ielen && bufsize > 2\n```\nTo find the loop invariants, we need to identify the variables that are not modified within the loop body and that have a constant value throughout the loop. In this case, the only variable that meets this criteria is `p`.\n\nThe loop invariant for `p` is:\n```scss\np == 0\n```\nThis invariant is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the loop in the given program are:\n```scss\n/*@\n    loop invariant p == 0;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have not included any other variables in the loop invariants, as they are not modified within the loop body and do not have a constant value throughout the loop."
