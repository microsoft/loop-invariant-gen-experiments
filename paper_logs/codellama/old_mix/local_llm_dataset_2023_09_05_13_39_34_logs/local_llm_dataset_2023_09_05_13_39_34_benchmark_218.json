            "content": " To find the loop invariants for the given program, we need to analyze the loop body and identify the conditions that remain true before, during, and after the loop execution.\n\nBefore the loop execution:\n\n1. `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` are all greater than or equal to 1.\n2. `d1`, `d2`, and `d3` are all equal to 1.\n3. `c1` and `c2` are both false.\n\nDuring the loop execution:\n\n1. At least one of `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` is greater than or equal to 1.\n2. `d1`, `d2`, and `d3` are all equal to 1.\n3. `c1` and `c2` are both false.\n\nAfter the loop termination:\n\n1. At least one of `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` is equal to 0.\n2. `d1`, `d2`, and `d3` are all equal to 1.\n3. `c1` and `c2` are both false.\n\nTherefore, the necessary loop invariants for the while loop are:\n\n1. `x1 >= 1 && x2 >= 1 && x3 >= 1`\n2. `d1 == 1 && d2 == 1 && d3 == 1`\n3. `c1 == false && c2 == false`\n\nWe can output these loop invariants in the form of ACSL annotations for loops as follows:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x1 >= 1 && x2 >= 1 && x3 >= 1;\n    loop invariant d1 == 1 && d2 == 1 && d3 == 1;\n    loop invariant c1 == false && c2 == false;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have not used any variables or functions that are not declared in the program, and we have not made any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given. We have also avoided using keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops, and we have not used the `@` notation for any variable."
