Therefore, we can say that the loop invariant is true during each iteration of the loop.\n3. After the loop termination:\nAfter the loop termination, the variable `x` has reached the value of `n`, and the variable `m` has been assigned the value of `x` if the condition `unknown_int()` is true. Therefore, we can say that the loop invariant is true after the loop termination.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclude that the loop invariant is true before the loop execution starts, during each iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nHere is the loop invariant in ACSL notation:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant m >= 0 || n <= 0;\n    loop invariant m < n || n <= 0;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used the `@` symbol to indicate that the following code block is an ACSL annotation. The `loop invariant` keyword is used to specify the loop invariant, and the `x >= 0` and `m >= 0 || n <= 0` conditions are the loop invariants that are true before the loop execution starts, during each iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination, respectively."
