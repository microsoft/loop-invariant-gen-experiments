After the loop termination, the sum of the variables `v4`, `i`, `j`, and `k` is equal to the value of `l`.\n\nThe loop invariants can be expressed as:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant v4 == 0 || i == 0 || j == 0 || k == 0;\n    loop invariant l < n;\n    loop invariant (i+j+k+v4) == l;\n*/\n```\nNote that the loop invariants are expressed as a conjunction of three statements. The first statement ensures that the variables `v4`, `i`, `j`, and `k` are initialized to 0 before the loop execution. The second statement ensures that the loop condition `l < n` is true in every iteration of the loop. The third statement ensures that the sum of the variables `v4`, `i`, `j`, and `k` is equal to the value of `l` after the loop termination."
