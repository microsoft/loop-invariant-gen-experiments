In every iteration of the loop, we have the following assignments:\n\t* `a++`: The variable `a` is incremented by 1.\n\t* `b += (j - i)`: The variable `b` is incremented by the difference between `j` and `i`.\n\t* `i += 2`: The variable `i` is incremented by 2.\n\t* `if (i%2 == 0)`: If `i` is even, then `j` is incremented by 2. Otherwise, `j` is incremented by 1.\n\nFrom the loop body, we can identify the following loop invariants:\n\n* `a` is always equal to `b`\n* `i` is always even\n* `j` is always equal to `i` + 1\n\nThese loop invariants are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the loop in the program above are:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant a == b;\n    loop invariant i%2 == 0;\n    loop invariant j == i + 1;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have not used any variables or functions that are not declared in the program. We have also not made any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given. All undefined variables contain garbage values, and we have not used any variables that have garbage values. Finally, we have not used any keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops."

The loop continues to execute as long as the value returned by `unknown_int()` is non-zero.\n\nNow, let's find the loop invariants. A loop invariant is a condition that remains true before, during, and after the execution of the loop. To find the loop invariants, we need to identify the variables that are modified within the loop body and the loop condition, and then determine the conditions under which those variables remain unchanged.\n\nBased on the loop body and the loop condition, we can identify the following variables that are modified within the loop:\n\n1. `a`: The value of `a` is incremented by 1 in the loop body.\n2. `b`: The value of `b` is updated based on the difference between `j` and `i` in the loop body.\n3. `i`: The value of `i` is incremented by 2 in the loop body.\n4. `j`: The value of `j` is updated based on the value of `i` in the loop body.\n\nNext, we need to determine the conditions under which these variables remain unchanged. We can do this by analyzing the loop body and the loop condition.\n\nBased on the loop body and the loop condition, we can determine the following loop invariants:\n\n1. `a` remains unchanged before the loop execution, during the loop iterations, and after the loop termination.\n2. `b` remains unchanged before the loop execution, during the loop iterations, and after the loop termination.\n3. `i` remains unchanged before the loop execution, during the loop iterations, and after the loop termination.\n4. `j` remains unchanged before the loop execution, during the loop iterations, and after the loop termination.\n\nHere are the loop invariants in ACSL format:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant a == a;\n    loop invariant b == b;\n    loop invariant i == i;\n    loop invariant j == j;\n*/\n```\nNote that the loop invariants are based on the analysis of the loop body and the loop condition, and do not take into account any external factors or assumptions."
