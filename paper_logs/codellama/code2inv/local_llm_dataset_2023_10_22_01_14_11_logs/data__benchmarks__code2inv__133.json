This means that `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.\n\nThe loop condition is `x < n`, which means that the loop will continue to execute as long as `x` is less than `n`.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can write the following loop invariants:\n\n1. At the beginning of the loop, `x` is equal to 0.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, `x` is equal to `x + 1`.\n3. After the loop termination, `x` is equal to `n`.\n\nWe can also add bounds on the values of `x` and `n` to ensure that they are within the range of valid values. For example, we can assume that `x` is always between 0 and `n`, and `n` is always between 0 and `x`.\n\nHere are the loop invariants in ACSL format:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant x == 0;\n    loop invariant x == x + 1;\n    loop invariant x == n;\n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant x <= n;\n    loop invariant n >= 0;\n    loop invariant n <= x;\n*/\n```\nNote that these loop invariants are not exhaustive, and there may be other loop invariants that can be derived from the program. However, these loop invariants should be sufficient to help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program."
