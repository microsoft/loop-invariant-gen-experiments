The loop condition is `x <= n`. This means that the loop will execute until `x` is greater than `n`.\n\nNow, let's find the loop invariants. A loop invariant is a condition that is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. To find the loop invariants, we need to identify the conditions that are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nHere are the loop invariants for the while loop in the given program:\n\n1. Before the loop execution, the condition `x <= n` is true.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, the condition `x <= n` is true.\n3. After the loop termination, the condition `x > n` is true.\n\nWe can express these loop invariants in ACSL annotations as follows:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x <= n;\n    loop invariant x <= n;\n    loop invariant x > n;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used the `loop invariant` keyword to indicate that the condition is a loop invariant. We have also used the `;` character to separate the loop invariants.\n\nFinally, we need to make sure that the loop invariants imply the post-condition. In this case, the post-condition is `y >= 0`. We can use implication to show that the loop invariants imply the post-condition.\n\nHere's the complete ACSL annotation for the while loop in the given program:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x <= n;\n    loop invariant x <= n;\n    loop invariant x > n;\n    assume(y >= 0);\n*/\n```\nIn this annotation, we have added the `assume` keyword to indicate that the post-condition is a non-deterministic function. We have also added the `;` character to separate the loop invariants and the post-condition.\n\nTo summarize, the necessary loop invariants for the while loop in the given C program are:\n\n* `x <= n` before the loop execution\n* `x <= n` in every iteration of the loop\n* `x > n` after the loop termination\n\nThese loop invariants imply the post-condition `y >= 0`, which is the desired property of the program."
