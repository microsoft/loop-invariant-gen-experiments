Output loop invariants that are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination, such that the loop invariants imply the post condition.\n\nBased on these steps, we can identify the following loop invariants for the while loop:\n\n1. Before the loop execution, the variable `y` is equal to or greater than 0.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, the variable `y` is equal to or greater than 0.\n3. After the loop termination, the variable `y` is equal to or greater than 0.\n\nWe can express these loop invariants using ACSL annotations as follows:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used the `>=` operator to indicate that the variable `y` is equal to or greater than 0. This is because the loop condition checks whether `y` is greater than or equal to 0, and we want the loop invariant to be true at the beginning, during the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nWe have also used the `;` symbol to indicate that the loop invariant is true in every iteration of the loop. This is because the loop condition checks whether `y` is greater than or equal to 0, and we want the loop invariant to be true in every iteration of the loop.\n\nBy using these loop invariants, Frama-C can verify that the post-condition of the program is true. Specifically, Frama-C can use the loop invariants to prove that the variable `y` is equal to or greater than 0 at the beginning, during the loop, and after the loop termination."
