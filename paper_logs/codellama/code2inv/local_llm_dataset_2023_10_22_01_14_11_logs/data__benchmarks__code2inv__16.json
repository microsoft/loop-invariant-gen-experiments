This is because `x` is initialized to 0 and `n` is assumed to be positive.\n* In every iteration of the loop, the loop invariant is `x >= 0` and `n > 0` and `m >= 0`. This is because `m` is initialized to 0 and `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.\n* After the loop termination, the loop invariant is `x >= 0` and `n > 0` and `m >= 0`. This is because `x` and `m` are still positive, and `n` is still positive.\n\nSo, the loop invariants are:\n\n* `x >= 0` and `n > 0` before the loop execution.\n* `x >= 0` and `n > 0` and `m >= 0` in every iteration of the loop.\n* `x >= 0` and `n > 0` and `m >= 0` after the loop termination.\n\nFinally, let's use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code:\n\n* The assertion `m >= 0` is guarded by the condition `n > 0`. Therefore, we can use implication to make the invariant trivially true at the beginning and end of the loop.\n* The loop invariants can be expressed as:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant x >= 0 && n > 0;\n    loop invariant x >= 0 && n > 0 && m >= 0;\n*/\n```\nThis is the loop invariants for the while loop in the program above."

The loop condition is `x < n`.\n\nBased on the information provided, we can make the following observations:\n\n1. The loop invariant `i1` is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. This invariant can be expressed as `x >= 0 && x <= n && m >= 0 && m <= x`.\n2. The loop invariant `i2` is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. This invariant can be expressed as `n > 0 ==> x >= 0 && x <= n && m >= 0 && m <= x`.\n\nNote that the second invariant is implied by the first invariant, so we can omit it and only use the first invariant.\n\nTherefore, the necessary loop invariants for the while loop are:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nIt's worth noting that the loop invariants are not mutually exclusive, so it's possible that the program satisfies multiple loop invariants. However, in this case, we only need to find one loop invariant that is sufficient to prove the post-condition."

The loop condition: `x < n`\n2. The `if` statement: `if (unknown()) { m = x; }`\n3. The assignment to `x`: `x = x + 1;`\n\nFrom the loop condition, we know that `x` is always less than `n`. Therefore, we can add the conjunction `x < n` to the loop invariant.\n\nFrom the `if` statement, we know that if `unknown()` is true, then `m` is set to `x`.

The post-condition is:\n\n* `m >= 0`\n\nThis post-condition states that `m` is greater than or equal to 0 after the loop.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can write the necessary loop invariants for the while loop.

The third loop invariant ensures that the value of `x` is less than or equal to `n`, which is the maximum value that `x` can take. The fourth loop invariant ensures that the value of `m` is less than or equal to `x`, which is the maximum value that `m` can take.\n\nFinally, we can write the loop invariants in the ACSL annotation format:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant m >= 0;\n    loop invariant x <= n;\n    loop invariant m <= x;\n*/\n```\nThese loop invariants ensure that the loop terminates and the post-condition is satisfied."
