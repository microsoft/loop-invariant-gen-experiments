These values are based on the pre-conditions and the loop body.\n\nFinally, we can use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. We can add an implication to the loop invariants to make them true in the initial iteration and the final iteration. For example:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant i <= j ==> (i <= 10);\n    loop invariant j >= i ==> (j >= 1);\n*/\n```\nThis will ensure that the loop invariants are true in the initial iteration and the final iteration, even if the loop condition is not satisfied.\n\nIn summary, the necessary loop invariants for the while loop in the given program are:\n\n1. `i` is always less than or equal to `j`\n2. `j` is always greater than or equal to `i`\n3. `i` is always less than or equal to `10`\n4. `j` is always greater than or equal to `1`\n\nWe can express these loop invariants using ACSL annotations in the following way:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant i <= j;\n    loop invariant j >= i;\n    loop invariant i <= 10;\n    loop invariant j >= 1;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used the `<=`, `>=` operators to represent the less than or equal to and greater than or equal to relations, respectively.\n\nAlso, we have used the `10` and `1` constants to represent the maximum and minimum values that `j` and `i` can take, respectively. These values are based on the pre-conditions and the loop body."
