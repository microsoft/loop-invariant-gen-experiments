After the loop terminates, `i != j`.\n\nWe can write these loop invariants in ACSL notation as follows:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant j = 0 && i = 0;\n    loop invariant j = j + y && i = i + 1;\n    loop invariant i != j;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used the `&&` operator to combine the loop invariants. This is because each loop invariant is a conjunction of conditions, and we want to ensure that all conditions are true for the loop to be considered invariant.\n\nAlso, note that we have used the `=` operator to compare the values of the variables. This is because we want to ensure that the variables have the expected values at each point in the loop.\n\nFinally, we can use these loop invariants to verify the post-condition of the loop. We can do this by using the `assert` statement to check that the post-condition is true after the loop terminates.\n\nHere's the complete code with the loop invariants and the `assert` statement:\n```\n#define assume(e) if(!(e)) return 0;\n\nint main() {\n  \n  int i;\n  int j;\n  int x;\n  int y;\n  \n  (j = 0);\n  (i = 0);\n  (y = 2);\n  \n  while ((i <= x)) {\n    {\n    (i  = (i + 1));\n    (j  = (j + y));\n    }\n\n  }\n  \n/*@\n    loop invariant j = 0 && i = 0;\n    loop invariant j = j + y && i = i + 1;\n    loop invariant i != j;\n*/\n\nif ( (i != j) )\n{;\n//@ assert( (y != 1) );\n}\n\n}\n```\nIn this code, we have added the loop invariants and the `assert` statement to verify the post-condition of the loop. The loop invariants ensure that the loop is invariant, and the `assert` statement checks that the post-condition is true after the loop terminates."
