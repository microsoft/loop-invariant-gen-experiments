After the loop terminates:\nThe loop terminates when the condition `unknown()` is true. Therefore, after the loop terminates, we can say that the following conditions are true:\n* `i >= x` (since the loop body increments `i` by 1 if `i < y`, and `x` is non-negative)\n* `0 > i` (since the loop body increments `i` by 1 if `i < y`, and `i` is initialized to 0)\n* `i >= y` (since the loop body increments `i` by 1 if `i < y`, and `y` is non-negative)\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the while loop in the program are:\n\n1. Before the loop starts:\n`i == 0`\n`x >= 0`\n`y >= 0`\n`i <= x`\n`i <= y`\n`i < y`\n1. During each iteration of the loop:\n`i < y`\n`x >= 0`\n`y >= 0`\n`i <= x`\n`i <= y`\n1. After the loop terminates:\n`i >= x`\n`0 > i`\n`i >= y`\n\nNote that the loop invariants are conjunctions of the conditions that are true before the loop starts, during each iteration of the loop, and after the loop terminates. We can use these loop invariants to verify the post-condition `assert(i >= y)` using Frama-C."
