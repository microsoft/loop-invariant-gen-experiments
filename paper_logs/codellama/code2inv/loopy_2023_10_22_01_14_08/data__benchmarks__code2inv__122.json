Before the loop execution, `i` is initialized to 1, and `sn` is initialized to 0.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, `i` is incremented by 1, and `sn` is incremented by 1.\n3. After the loop termination, `i` is equal to `size`, and `sn` is equal to the sum of the values in the loop.\n\nNow, let's consider the post-condition of the loop. The post-condition is that `sn` is equal to the sum of the values in the loop.\n\nBased on the loop invariants above, we can see that the post-condition is satisfied if `i` is equal to `size` and `sn` is equal to the sum of the values in the loop.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the while loop in the given program are:\n\n1. `i` is initialized to 1 before the loop execution.\n2. `i` is incremented by 1 in every iteration of the loop.\n3. `sn` is initialized to 0 before the loop execution.\n4. `sn` is incremented by 1 in every iteration of the loop.\n5. `i` is equal to `size` after the loop termination.\n6. `sn` is equal to the sum of the values in the loop after the loop termination.\n\nThese loop invariants can be used to verify the post-condition of the loop using Frama-C.",
