Therefore, we can conclude that `x` is equal to 0 and `m` is not equal to 0.\n\nNext, let's find the loop invariants that are true in every iteration of the loop.\n\nIn every iteration of the loop, the value of `x` is incremented by 1, and the value of `m` is not changed if the function `unknown()` returns `false`. Therefore, we can conclude that `x` is always equal to `n - 1` and `m` is not equal to `n - 1`.\n\nFinally, let's find the loop invariants that are true after the loop termination.\n\nAfter the loop termination, the value of `x` is equal to `n`, and the value of `m` is not equal to `n`. Therefore, we can conclude that `x` is equal to `n` and `m` is not equal to `n`.\n\nNow, let's combine all the loop invariants that we have found.

Therefore, we can conclude that `x` is equal to 0 and `m` is not equal to 0.\n\nNext, let's find the loop invariants that are true in every iteration of the loop.\n\nIn every iteration of the loop, the value of `x` is incremented by 1, and the value of `m` is not changed if the function `unknown()` returns `false`. Therefore, we can conclude that `x` is always equal to `n - 1` and `m` is not equal to `n - 1`.\n\nFinally, let's find the loop invariants that are true after the loop termination.\n\nAfter the loop termination, the value of `x` is equal to `n`, and the value of `m` is not equal to `n`. Therefore, we can conclude that `x` is equal to `n` and `m` is not equal to `n`.\n\nNow, let's combine all the loop invariants that we have found. We can use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code.\n\nThe loop invariants that are true before the loop execution are:\n\n* `x` is equal to 0\n* `m` is not equal to 0\n\nThe loop invariants that are true in every iteration of the loop are:\n\n* `x` is always equal to `n - 1`\n* `m` is not equal to `n - 1`\n\nThe loop invariants that are true after the loop termination are:\n\n* `x` is equal to `n`\n* `m` is not equal to `n`\n\nTherefore, the necessary loop invariants for the while loop in the program are:\n\n* `x` is equal to 0 or `x` is equal to `n - 1`\n* `m` is not equal to 0 or `m` is not equal to `n - 1`\n* `x` is equal to `n`\n* `m` is not equal to `n`\n\nWe can use implication to combine these loop invariants. The final loop invariants are:\n\n* `(x == 0) ==> (x == n - 1)`\n* `(m != 0) ==> (m != n - 1)`\n* `(x == n) ==> (m != n)`\n\nNote that we have used implication instead of if-then to take care of the conditional nature of the code. We have also used conjunctions to bound the maximum and minimum values that the variables `x` and `m` can take.",
