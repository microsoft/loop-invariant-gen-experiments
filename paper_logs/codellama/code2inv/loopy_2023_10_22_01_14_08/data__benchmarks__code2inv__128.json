For example, we can assume that `x` and `y` are both non-negative integers, so we can add the conjunction `x >= 0` and `y >= 0`.\n\nNext, we can add a conjunction to bound the maximum value that `x` can take. Since `x` is incremented by `x` on each iteration, `x` can never be greater than `2^31 - 1`, which is the maximum value that an `int` can hold. So we can add the conjunction `x <= 2^31 - 1`.\n\nFinally, we can add a conjunction to bound the minimum value that `y` can take.

Moreover, the loop invariants imply that the post-condition `(x >= 1)` is true after the loop termination, since `x` is always greater than or equal to `1` in every iteration of the loop.\n\nTherefore, we have found the necessary loop invariants for the while loop to help Frama-C verify the post-condition `(x >= 1)`."

Identify the post-condition: The post-condition for the loop is `(x >= 1)`.\n5. Identify the loop invariants:\n\nThe loop invariants are the conditions that are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. In this case, the loop invariants are:\n\n(i) Before the loop execution: `x = 1` and `y` is not determined.\n\n(ii) In every iteration of the loop: `x` is even and `y` is not determined.\n\n(iii) After the loop termination: `x >= 1` and `y` is not determined.\n\nThese loop invariants imply the post-condition `(x >= 1)`, which is the desired property of the program.\n\nHere is the code block with the loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x = 1;\n    loop invariant y is not determined;\n    loop invariant x is even;\n    loop invariant y is not determined;\n    loop invariant x >= 1;\n    loop invariant y is not determined;\n*/\n```\nNote that the loop invariants are not necessarily the minimal set of conditions that imply the post-condition. However, they are sufficient to prove the post-condition using the loop invariants."

We also need to make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n\nThe loop condition is `x < y`. The loop body consists of a single statement: `(x = x + x)`.\n\nThe pre-conditions are:\n\n* `x` is initially assigned the value 1.\n* `y` is not explicitly initialized, so it contains a garbage value.\n\nWe can use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. Let's use implication (==>) instead of using if-then.\n\nTo bound the maximum and minimum values that the variables can take, we can add conjunctions. For example, we can add the conjunction `x >= 1` to bound the minimum value of `x`.\n\nWe can also add a conjunction for the relation between `x` and `y`. Since `x` is always equal to or smaller than `y`, we can add the conjunction `x <= y`.\n\nNow, let's think about the loop invariants. We want the loop invariants to be true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nHere are some possible loop invariants:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant (x >= 1);\n    loop invariant (x <= y);\n    loop invariant (x < y) ==> (x >= 1);\n    loop invariant (x < y) ==> (x <= y);\n*/\n```\nThe first two loop invariants are true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop. The third and fourth loop invariants are true after the loop termination.\n\nThe first loop invariant states that `x` is always greater than or equal to 1. This is true because `x` is initialized to 1 before the loop.\n\nThe second loop invariant states that `x` is always less than or equal to `y`. This is true because `x` is incremented by `x + x` in every iteration of the loop, and `x + x` is always less than or equal to `y`.\n\nThe third loop invariant states that if `x < y`, then `x` is greater than or equal to 1. This is true because if `x < y`, then `x + x` is less than or equal to `y`, and `x + x` is always greater than or equal to 1.\n\nThe fourth loop invariant states that if `x < y`, then `x` is less than or equal to `y`. This is true because if `x < y`, then `x + x` is less than or equal to `y`, and `x + x` is always less than or equal to `y`.\n\nThese loop invariants imply the post-condition `x >= 1`, which is the assertion in the program.

Loop Body:\nThe loop body consists of a single statement, which is an assignment to the variable `x`. The assignment statement is `(x = (x + x))`.\n2. Loop Condition:\nThe loop condition is `x < y`.\n3. Loop Invariants:\nWe need to find three loop invariants:\n\na. Before the loop execution:\nThere is no loop invariant before the loop execution because the loop is entered only if `x < y`.\n\nb. In every iteration of the loop:\nWe can write a loop invariant that is true in every iteration of the loop. Let's call this invariant `I`.\n\n`I`: `x` is even and `y` is odd.\n\nThis invariant is true in every iteration of the loop because the loop body doubles `x` in every iteration, and `y` remains unchanged.\n\nc. After the loop termination:\nWe can write a loop invariant that is true after the loop termination. Let's call this invariant `J`.\n\n`J`: `x` is even and `y` is odd.\n\nThis invariant is true after the loop termination because the loop is exited only when `x >= y`, which means that `x` is even and `y` is odd.\n\nd. Combining the loop invariants:\nWe can combine the loop invariants `I`, `J`, and `K` to form a single loop invariant that is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\n`K`: `x` is even and `y` is odd, and `x` is greater than or equal to `y`.\n\nThis loop invariant is true before the loop execution because `x` is initialized to 1, which is even. It is also true in every iteration of the loop because `x` is doubled in every iteration, and `y` remains unchanged. Finally, it is true after the loop termination because the loop is exited only when `x >= y`, which means that `x` is even and `y` is odd.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the while loop in the given program are `I`, `J`, and `K`.",
