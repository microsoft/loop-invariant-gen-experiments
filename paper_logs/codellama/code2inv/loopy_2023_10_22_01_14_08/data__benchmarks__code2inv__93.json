Loop invariants:\nTo ensure that the loop terminates, we need to ensure that the loop condition `i < n` is always true.\n\nWe can achieve this by adding the loop invariant `i <= n` to the loop.\n\nWe also need to ensure that the variables `x` and `y` are always within the bounds of `0` and `2 * n`.\n\nWe can achieve this by adding the loop invariants `0 <= x <= 2 * n` and `0 <= y <= 2 * n` to the loop.\n\nWe also need to ensure that the variables `x` and `y` are always related by the equation `3 * n = x + y`.\n\nWe can achieve this by adding the loop invariant `3 * n = x + y` to the loop.\n\n1. Implication:\nWe can use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code.\n\nWe can use the implication `unknown() ==> (x = x + 1)` to ensure that `x` is always equal to `x + 1` when `unknown()` is true.\n\nWe can use the implication `unknown() ==> (y = y + 2)` to ensure that `y` is always equal to `y + 2` when `unknown()` is true.\n\nWe can use the implication `!unknown() ==> (x = x + 2)` to ensure that `x` is always equal to `x + 2` when `unknown()` is false.\n\nWe can use the implication `!unknown() ==> (y = y + 1)` to ensure that `y` is always equal to `y + 1` when `unknown()` is false.\n\n1.
