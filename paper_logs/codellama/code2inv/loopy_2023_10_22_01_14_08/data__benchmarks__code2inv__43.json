Therefore, we can add the following loop invariant:\n```\nloop invariant c >= n;\n```\nThis invariant is true before the loop execution, since `c` is initialized to 0 and `n` is greater than or equal to 0. It is also true in every iteration of the loop, since `c` is only modified if `c > n`. Finally, it is true after the loop termination, since the loop terminates when `unknown()` returns false, which means that `c` will not be modified again.\n\nNow, let's analyze the second if-else branch:\n```\nif (unknown()) {\n  if (c == n) {\n    c = 1;\n  }\n}\n```\nIn this branch, the `c` variable is modified only if `c == n`. Therefore, we can add the following loop invariant:\n```\nloop invariant c == n;\n```\nThis invariant is true before the loop execution, since `c` is initialized to 0 and `n` is greater than or equal to 0. It is also true in every iteration of the loop, since `c` is only modified if `c == n`. Finally, it is true after the loop termination, since the loop terminates when `unknown()` returns false, which means that `c` will not be modified again.\n\nNow, let's combine the two loop invariants to get the overall loop invariant for the while loop:\n```\nloop invariant c >= n && c == n;\n```\nThis invariant is true before the loop execution, since `c` is initialized to 0 and `n` is greater than or equal to 0. It is also true in every iteration of the loop, since `c` is only modified if `c >= n` and `c == n`. Finally, it is true after the loop termination, since the loop terminates when `unknown()` returns false, which means that `c` will not be modified again.\n\nTherefore, the overall loop invariant for the while loop is:\n```\nloop invariant c >= n && c == n;\n```\nThis invariant implies the post-condition of the program, which is:\n```\n//@ assert(n > -1);\n```\nTherefore, we can use the loop invariant to prove the post-condition of the program."
