We can start by making a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n\nPre-conditions:\n\n* `sn` is initialized to 0\n* `x` is initialized to 0\n\nVariable assignments:\n\n* `sn` is assigned the value of `sn + 1` in each iteration of the loop\n* `x` is assigned the value of `x + 1` in each iteration of the loop\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body and the loop condition. The loop body contains two assignments: `x = x + 1` and `sn = sn + 1`. The loop condition is `unknown()`.\n\nLoop invariants:\n\n* Before the loop execution, `sn` is equal to 0 and `x` is equal to 0.\n* In every iteration of the loop, `sn` is equal to `sn + 1` and `x` is equal to `x + 1`.\n* After the loop termination, `sn` is equal to `-1` if `sn` is not equal to `x`.\n\nWe can express these loop invariants using ACSL annotations. Here is an example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant (sn == 0 && x == 0) ==> (sn == 0 && x == 0);\n    loop invariant (sn == sn + 1 && x == x + 1) ==> (sn == sn + 1 && x == x + 1);\n    loop invariant (sn != x) ==> (sn == -1);\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. We have also added conjunctions that bound the maximum and minimum values that `sn` and `x` can take, if such bounds exist. We have also added a conjunction for their relation, which is that `sn` is always equal to or smaller than `x`. Finally, we have used the guard condition in an implication to make the invariant trivially true at the beginning or end of the loop, if necessary."

This is because we want to ensure that the loop invariants are true in every iteration of the loop, including the first iteration when `sn` and `x` have initial values `0`.\n\nFinally, we can use the loop invariants to verify the post-condition of the program. The post-condition is that `sn` and `x` have the same value at the end of the loop. We can express this post-condition using the loop invariants as follows:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant sn == x;\n    loop invariant x == sn + 1;\n    postcondition sn == x;\n*/\n```\nThis post-condition is true if the loop invariants are true in every iteration of the loop, and if the loop terminates with `sn` and `x` having the same value."
