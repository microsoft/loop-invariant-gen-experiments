The loop terminates when `i` exceeds `x`.\n\nTo find the loop invariants, we need to analyze the loop body and the loop condition. We can start by identifying the variables that are involved in the loop and their initial values.\n\n* `i` is initialized to 0 and is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.\n* `j` is initialized to 0 and is added `y` in each iteration of the loop.\n* `x` is not initialized and is used as the loop condition.\n* `y` is initialized to 1 and is added to `j` in each iteration of the loop.\n\nNext, we need to identify the loop invariants. A loop invariant is a condition that is true before the loop starts, remains true during each iteration of the loop, and is still true after the loop terminates.\n\nBased on the loop body and the loop condition, we can identify the following loop invariants:\n\n* `i` is less than or equal to `x` before the loop starts.\n* `j` is less than or equal to `i` before the loop starts.\n* `j` is less than or equal to `i` in each iteration of the loop.\n* `j` is less than or equal to `i` after the loop terminates.\n* `y` is equal to 1 before the loop starts.\n* `y` is equal to 1 in each iteration of the loop.\n* `y` is equal to 1 after the loop terminates.\n\nTo represent these loop invariants in ACSL, we can use the following annotations:\n```c\n/*@\n    loop invariant i <= x;\n    loop invariant j <= i;\n    loop invariant j <= i;\n    loop invariant j <= i;\n    loop invariant y == 1;\n    loop invariant y == 1;\n    loop invariant y == 1;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used the `==` operator to represent equality instead of `=`, as `=` is used for assignment in C. Also, we have used the `<=` operator to represent \"less than or equal to\" instead of `<=`, as `<= is used for \"less than or equal to\" in ACSL.\n\nFinally, we need to output the loop invariants in one code block, as follows:\n```c\n/*@\n    loop invariant i <= x;\n    loop invariant j <= i;\n    loop invariant j <= i;\n    loop invariant j <= i;\n    loop invariant y == 1;\n    loop invariant y == 1;\n    loop invariant y == 1;\n*/\n```"

Therefore, the loop body does not introduce any new loop invariants.\n\nLoop Condition:\nThe loop condition is `i <= x`. This condition is true if and only if `i` is less than or equal to `x`. Therefore, the loop condition introduces the loop invariant `i <= x`.\n\nOther Invariants:\nThere are no other loop invariants introduced in the loop body or the loop condition.\n\nFinal Loop Invariants:\nThe final loop invariants are `i <= x` and `j = j + y`.\n\nNote that the loop invariant `i <= x` is not a conjunction, so we do not need to split it into its parts. The loop invariant `j = j + y` is a conjunction, so we can split it into its parts: `j = j` and `y = y`.\n\nTherefore, the final loop invariants are:\n\n1. `i <= x`\n2. `j = j`\n3. `y = y`\n\nNote that we do not need to add conjunctions for the maximum and minimum values of `i` and `j` because these values are not explicitly mentioned in the program. Similarly, we do not need to add conjunctions for the relation between `i` and `j` because this relation is not explicitly mentioned in the program.\n\nAlso, note that we do not need to use the `@` symbol for the loop invariants because the program does not use ACSL annotations for loops.",
