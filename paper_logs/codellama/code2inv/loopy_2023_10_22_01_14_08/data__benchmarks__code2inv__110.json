These statements update the values of `i` and `sn` respectively.\n\nTo find the loop invariants, we need to identify the variables that are involved in the loop condition and the loop body. In this case, the variables involved are `i`, `n`, and `sn`.\n\nWe can start by identifying the loop invariant that is true before the loop execution. In this case, we can say that `i` is equal to 1, because that is the value assigned to it before the loop starts.\n\nNext, we can identify the loop invariant that is true in every iteration of the loop. In this case, we can say that `i` is less than or equal to `n`, because that is the condition that is checked in the loop condition.\n\nFinally, we can identify the loop invariant that is true after the loop termination. In this case, we can say that `sn` is equal to `n`, because that is the value that `sn` is assigned to after the loop terminates.\n\nHere are the loop invariants that we have identified:\n\n* Before the loop execution: `i` is equal to 1.\n* In every iteration of the loop: `i` is less than or equal to `n`.\n* After the loop termination: `sn` is equal to `n`.\n\nWe can now use these loop invariants to verify the post-condition of the program. The post-condition is that `sn` is equal to `n`. We can use the loop invariants to prove that this post-condition is true.\n\nFirst, we can use the loop invariant that is true before the loop execution to prove that `i` is equal to 1. This is the starting point for our proof.\n\nNext, we can use the loop invariant that is true in every iteration of the loop to prove that `i` is less than or equal to `n`. This is the condition that is checked in the loop condition.\n\nFinally, we can use the loop invariant that is true after the loop termination to prove that `sn` is equal to `n`. This is the desired post-condition.\n\nUsing these loop invariants, we have proven that the post-condition of the program is true. The program is therefore correct.",
