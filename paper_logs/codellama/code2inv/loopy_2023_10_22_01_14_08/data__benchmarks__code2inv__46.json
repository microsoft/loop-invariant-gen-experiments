Therefore, we cannot make any assumptions about the loop condition.\n\nNext, we can see that the loop body contains two if-else statements. The first if-else statement checks if `unknown()` is true, and if so, it increments `c` by 1. The second if-else statement checks if `c` is equal to `n`, and if so, it sets `c` to 1.\n\nWe can also see that the loop body contains a conjunction that bounds the maximum and minimum values that `c` can take. Specifically, `c` is bounded by `n`, since `c` is initialized to 0 and is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the loop invariants for the while loop are as follows:\n\n* Before the loop execution, `c` is equal to 0.\n* In every iteration of the loop, `c` is less than or equal to `n`.\n* After the loop termination, `c` is less than or equal to `n`.\n\nWe can express these loop invariants using ACSL annotations as follows:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant (c == 0);\n    loop invariant (c <= n);\n    loop invariant (c <= n);\n@*/\n```\nNote that we have used implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code.

Therefore, we can use the guard condition in an implication to make the assertion trivially true at the beginning and end of the loop.\n\nOverall, the loop invariants for the while loop in the given program are as follows:\n\n* Before the loop execution, `c` is equal to 0.\n* In every iteration of the loop, `c` is less than or equal to `n`.\n* After the loop termination, `c` is less than or equal to `n`.\n\nThese loop invariants imply the post-condition `c <= n`, which is the desired property that we want to verify using Frama-C."
