The condition is `x != 0`, which can be rewritten as `x > 0` or `x < 0`. We can choose to analyze the loop for both cases separately.\n\nFor the case `x > 0`, we have the following loop body:\n```c\n(x  = (x - 1));\n(y  = (y - 1));\n```\nThis loop body decrements the value of `x` and `y` by 1 in each iteration.

We can use the same loop invariants as above, with the exception that the values of `x` and `y` are always less than 0.\n\nNow, let's consider the post-condition of the loop.

The fourth loop invariant is also true before the loop execution, as x and y are not equal to 0. The fifth loop invariant is true in every iteration of the loop, as x is decremented by 1 and y is decremented by 1. The sixth loop invariant is also true in every iteration of the loop.\n\nThe seventh loop invariant is true after the loop termination, as the loop condition is x != 0, and the loop body is executed while x is not equal to 0.\n\nTherefore, the necessary loop invariants for Frama-C to verify the post-condition of the program are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n    loop invariant i3;\n    loop invariant i4;\n    loop invariant i5;\n    loop invariant i6;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code, and we have added conjunctions that bound the maximum and minimum values that the variables can take, if such bounds exist. We have also added a conjunction for the relation between x and y, as x is always equal to or smaller than y."

The loop condition is `x != 0`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `x` is not equal to 0.\n\nNow, let's find the loop invariants. A loop invariant is a condition that is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. We can find the loop invariants by analyzing the loop body and the loop condition.\n\nLoop invariants:\n\n* `i` is less than or equal to `j` in every iteration of the loop.\n* `x` is less than or equal to `y` in every iteration of the loop.\n* `x` is greater than or equal to 0 in every iteration of the loop.\n* `y` is greater than or equal to 0 in every iteration of the loop.\n\nWe can also use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. For example, we can use `implies` to make the loop invariants true when `x` is not equal to 0.\n\nLoop invariants with implication:\n\n* `i` is less than or equal to `j` implies `x` is not equal to 0.\n* `x` is less than or equal to `y` implies `x` is not equal to 0.\n* `x` is greater than or equal to 0 implies `x` is not equal to 0.\n* `y` is greater than or equal to 0 implies `x` is not equal to 0.\n\nFinally, we can add conjunctions that bound the maximum and minimum values that the variables can take, if such bounds exist.\n\nLoop invariants with conjunctions:\n\n* `i` is less than or equal to `j` and `i` is greater than or equal to 0 implies `x` is not equal to 0.\n* `x` is less than or equal to `y` and `x` is greater than or equal to 0 implies `x` is not equal to 0.\n* `y` is greater than or equal to 0 and `y` is less than or equal to `x` implies `x` is not equal to 0.\n\nThe loop invariants we have found imply the post-condition that `i` is not equal to `j`.

The loop condition is `x != 0`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `x` is not equal to 0.\n\nNow, let's find the loop invariants. A loop invariant is a condition that is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. We can find the loop invariants by analyzing the loop body and the loop condition.\n\nLoop invariants:\n\n* `i` is less than or equal to `j` in every iteration of the loop.\n* `x` is less than or equal to `y` in every iteration of the loop.\n* `x` is greater than or equal to 0 in every iteration of the loop.\n* `y` is greater than or equal to 0 in every iteration of the loop.\n\nWe can also use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. For example, we can use `implies` to make the loop invariants true when `x` is not equal to 0.\n\nLoop invariants with implication:\n\n* `i` is less than or equal to `j` implies `x` is not equal to 0.\n* `x` is less than or equal to `y` implies `x` is not equal to 0.\n* `x` is greater than or equal to 0 implies `x` is not equal to 0.\n* `y` is greater than or equal to 0 implies `x` is not equal to 0.\n\nFinally, we can add conjunctions that bound the maximum and minimum values that the variables can take, if such bounds exist.\n\nLoop invariants with conjunctions:\n\n* `i` is less than or equal to `j` and `i` is greater than or equal to 0 implies `x` is not equal to 0.\n* `x` is less than or equal to `y` and `x` is greater than or equal to 0 implies `x` is not equal to 0.\n* `y` is greater than or equal to 0 and `y` is less than or equal to `x` implies `x` is not equal to 0.\n\nThe loop invariants we have found imply the post-condition that `i` is not equal to `j`.
