The assertion \"z < 4608\" fails because it may not be true in all cases.\n\nThe assertion seems to be based on the assumption that z is less than 36 * 127 (because 4608 is equal to 36 * 128), but the loop can increment z further, making it equal to or greater than 4608.\n\nWe should add a loop invariant that reflects the relationship between z, c and y after each iteration of the loop.

                    "First, let's analyse the loop and the invariants:\n\nThe loop increments both `c` and `z` by 1 on each iteration until `c` reaches 36. \n\nSo, the invariants `0 <= c <= 36`, `z >= 36 * y`, and `c <= z` make sense, as `c` is always in the range [0, 36], `z` is always greater than or equal to `36 * y` as `z` is initialized as `36 * y` and is only incremented, and `c` is always less than or equal to `z` as they are both incremented at the same time.\n\nThe invariants `y >= 127`, `z - c == 36 * y`, and `z <= 36 * y + c` also make sense, as `y` is always greater than or equal to 127, `z - c` is equal to `36 * y` as `z` is initialized as `36 * y` and is only incremented when `c` is incremented, and `z` is always less than or equal to `36 * y + c` as `z` is only incremented when `c` is incremented.\n\nHowever, the post-loop assertion `(z < 4608)` is not proven. This is because the loop doesn't have a clear termination condition - it's based on `unknown()`, which is non-deterministic.\n\nThe assertion `(z < 4608)` can be satisfied if the loop runs less than or equal to 127 times (because 36 * 127 = 4572 and `z` can increase by at most 36 in the loop).\n\nSo, to prove this assertion, we need a loop invariant that states that the loop has run less than or equal to 127 times. A possible invariant is `c <= 127`.\n\nHowever, we don't actually need all of the original invariants to prove the post-loop assertion. We can remove some of them. \n\nSo, the final loop invariants are:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1: 0 <= c <= 36;\n    loop invariant i2: z >= 36 * y;\n    loop invariant i3: z - c == 36 * y;\n    loop invariant i4: c <= 127;\n*/\n```"

The input to Frama-C is a C program file with ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations.\nFor the given program with loop invariants and the output from Frama-C, fix the invariants that are not inductive or have syntax errors, so that the program can be verified.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. \n- For each invariant that has syntax errors, fix the syntax errors and ensure that ACSL syntax is followed.\n- For each invariant that is not inductive, there are four possibilities:\n    - The invariant is partially proven to be inductive: In this case, try to fix the non-inductive invariants that this invariant depends on.\n    - The invariant is preserved but not established: In this case, add a clause to the invariant such that the new invariant is holds before the loop execution.\n    - The invariant is established but not preserved: In this case, add a clause to the invariant such that the new invariant holds after a loop iteration if it holds before the loop iteration.\n    - The invariant is neither established nor preserved: In this case, remove it or replace it with a different inductive invariant, or add clauses to the invariant such that the new invariant is established and preserved.\n- Finally output loop invariants that are true \n(i) before the loop execution, \n(ii) in every iteration of the loop and \n(iii) after the loop termination, \nsuch that the loop invariants can be used to prove the assertion(s) that are labeled as \"Unproven\" by Frama-C.\n- If a loop invariant is a conjunction, split it into its parts.\n- Output all the loop invariants in one code block. For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values. Do not use variables that have garbage values.**\n- **Do not make assumptions about the values returned by non-deterministic function calls.**\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **Do not use keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops.**\n- **Use \\at(x, LoopEntry), instead of \\at(x, Pre) to refer to the value of a variable x just before the beginning of loop execution.**\n- **Variables that are not explicitly initialized, could have garbage values. Do not make any assumptions about such values.**"

If it is not, remove it or replace it with a different inductive invariant. If it is, then fix the other non-inductive invariants.\nIf an invariant is preserved but not established, add a clause to the invariant to make it established (a clause that makes the invariant hold before the loop begins).\nIf an invariant is established but not preserved, add a clause to the invariant to make it preserved (a clause that makes the invariant hold after the loop ends, assuming that it holds before the loop begins).\nIf an invariant is neither established nor preserved, remove it or replace it with a different inductive invariant.\n\nIf none of the above is possible, add a new loop invariant to strengthen the existing invariants.\n\nPlease fix all the above-mentioned errors, and provide the corrected loop invariants for the program that are sufficient to verify the assertions in the program.\nUse the ACSL syntax to specify the invariants. Output only one code block in the end, with the fixed invariants. **Do not output any other code blocks**.\nLet's think step by step."

We know that `y >= 127`, so the maximum value of `z` at the beginning of the loop is `36 * 127 = 4572`. We also know that `c` can be incremented at most 36 times. Since `z` is incremented by 1 when `c` is incremented, the maximum value of `z` after the loop is `4572 + 36 = 4608`. However, we need to prove that `z < 4608`. \n\nWe can add a new loop invariant that states `z < 36 * 127 + 36`.
