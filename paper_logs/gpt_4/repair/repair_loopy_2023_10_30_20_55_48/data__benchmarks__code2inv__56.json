The loop condition is simply `unknown()`, which is an external function, and we cannot make any assumptions about its return values. Therefore, the loop can terminate at any point, and we need to find invariants that hold in every iteration of the loop.\n\nNow let's analyze the loop body. In the loop body, there are two branches. In the first branch, if `c > n`, then `c` is incremented by 1. In the second branch, if `c == n`, then `c` is set to 1.\n\nNow let's analyze the loop invariants:\n\n1. `0 <= c <= n + 1`: This invariant is inductive and holds before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n2. `n > 0`: This invariant is inductive and holds before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n3. `(c <= n) || (c == 1)`: This invariant is inductive and holds before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n4. `(c > n) ==> (c >= n + 1)`: This invariant is inductive and holds before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n5. `(c > n) ==> (c == n + 1)`: This invariant is inductive and holds before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nAll the existing loop invariants are inductive and hold before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. However, the assertion `n <= -1` is still unproven. This means that we need to add a new loop invariant to strengthen the existing invariants.\n\nWe can notice that if `c == n`, then the value of `c` will be set to 1 in the next iteration, and therefore, it is impossible for the loop to terminate with `c == n`. Based on this observation, we can add the following loop invariant:\n\n6. `c != n`\n\nNow, the corrected loop invariants are:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= c <= n + 1;\n    loop invariant n > 0;\n    loop invariant (c <= n) || (c == 1);\n    loop invariant (c > n) ==> (c >= n + 1);\n    loop invariant (c > n) ==> (c == n + 1);\n    loop invariant c != n;\n*/\n```\n\nThese loop invariants are sufficient to verify the assertion `n <= -1` in the program."
