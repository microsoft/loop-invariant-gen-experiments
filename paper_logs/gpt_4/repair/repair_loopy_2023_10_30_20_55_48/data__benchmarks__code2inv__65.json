The loop condition is `x <= 100`, and inside the loop, `y` is assigned `100 - x` and `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.\n\nLet's analyze the given loop invariants:\n\n- `i1: 1 <= x <= 101`: This invariant is partially proven to be inductive, meaning it holds true within the loop but it might not hold true before the loop starts or after it ends. It is valid before the loop starts as `x` is initialized to `1`. However, after the loop ends, `x` would be `101` which is not within the range. So, we need to adjust the upper bound of this invariant to `100` instead of `101`.\n\n- `i2: y == 100 - x + 1`: This invariant is preserved but not established. This means that it holds during the loop but not before the loop starts. Before the loop starts, `y` is not initialized and hence, this invariant doesn't hold true. We can fix this by initializing `y` to `100 - x + 1` before the loop starts.\n\n- `i3: y >= -100` and `i4: y <= 100`: These invariants are partially proven to be inductive. These invariants ensure that `y` is always between `-100` and `100`. However, since `y` is assigned `100 - x` in each iteration and `x` increases from `1` to `100`, `y` will always be between `0` and `99`. Therefore, we can change these invariants to `y >= 0` and `y <= 99`.\n\nAfter fixing the invariants, we also need to ensure that the assertion `y >= 0` is proven. It should be proven as `y` is always between `0` and `99` after the loop ends.\n\nHere are the corrected loop invariants:\n\n```\ny = 100 - x + 1;\n/*@\n    loop invariant 1 <= x <= 100;\n    loop invariant y == 100 - x + 1;\n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n    loop invariant y <= 99;\n*/\nwhile (x <= 100) {\n    y = 100 - x;\n    x = x + 1;\n}\n```"
