Therefore, the invariant `i1: 1 <= x` holds before the loop starts, is preserved during the loop, and also holds after the loop ends. Frama-C reports it as partially proven because it depends on other invariants that have not been proven.\n\n- The variable `y` is assigned `n - x` in every loop iteration. Therefore, the invariant `i3: y == n - x + 1` and `i5: y == n - x + 1` do not hold before the loop begins as `y` is not initialized before the loop and it's not equivalent to `n - x + 1`. Also, the invariant `i6: x > 1 ==> y == n - (x - 1)` is incorrect because `y` is assigned `n - x` in each iteration, not `n - (x - 1)`. We should remove or fix these invariants.\n\n- The invariant `i2: x <= n + 1` and `i4: x <= n + 1` are not established because `x` may be greater than `n + 1` before the loop begins. However, they are preserved during the loop because `x` is incremented by 1 in each loop iteration. We can fix this by changing the invariants to `x <= n + 2`.\n\n- The invariant `i7: x >= 1` is correct because `x` is initialized to 1 before the loop and is incremented in each loop iteration. \n\n- We need an invariant that connects `x` and `y` correctly, as `y` is assigned `n - x` in each loop iteration. A correct invariant would be `y == n - x + 1`.\n\nHere are the corrected loop invariants:\n```c\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 1 <= x;\n    loop invariant x <= n + 2;\n    loop invariant y == n - x + 1;\n    loop invariant x >= 1;\n*/\n```\nThese invariants are true (i) before the loop execution, (ii) in every iteration of the loop and (iii) after the loop termination.

We can keep this invariant as it is.\n- The second loop invariant `x <= n + 1` is preserved but not established. This means that it holds after a loop iteration if it holds before the loop iteration, but it does not hold before the loop execution. As `x` is initialized as 1 and `n` is not initialized, we cannot establish this invariant before the loop execution. We need to remove this invariant.\n- The third loop invariant `y == n - x + 1` is preserved but not established. This means that it holds after a loop iteration if it holds before the loop iteration, but it does not hold before the loop execution. As `y` is not initialized before the loop, we cannot establish this invariant before the loop execution. We need to remove this invariant.\n- The fourth loop invariant `y >= 0` is partially proven. This means that it is actually inductive but depends on other invariants which are not inductive. We can keep this invariant as it is.\n- Now, we need to add new inductive invariants that could strengthen the existing inductive invariants. As `x` and `y` are updated in each iteration, we can add invariants about their relationships. We can add an invariant `y == \\at(y, LoopEntry) - 1` that `y` is decremented by 1 in each loop iteration.
