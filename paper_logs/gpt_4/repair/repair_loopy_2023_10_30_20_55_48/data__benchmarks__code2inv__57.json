                    "Firstly, let's note down the pre-conditions and the initial variable assignments in the program:\n- c is set to 0.\n- n is greater than 0. \n\nNext, let's analyze the loop condition and loop body:\n- The loop continues as long as the function `unknown()` returns a non-zero value. The value returned by `unknown()` is non-deterministic.\n- In the loop body, if `unknown()` returns a non-zero value and `c > n`, `c` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `c == n`, `c` is set to 1.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop invariants and the corresponding messages from Frama-C:\n\n1. `i1: 0 <= c <= 2*n` is partially proven to be inductive. This means it's likely to be a correct invariant that depends on another invariant. We'll keep this invariant for now.\n\n2. `i2: n > 0` is partially proven to be inductive. This is a pre-condition for the loop and remains constant throughout the program, so it should be an inductive invariant. We'll keep this invariant.\n\n3. `i3: (c == 1) || (c > n)` is preserved but not established. This invariant is not true before the loop begins, so it is not an inductive invariant. We should remove this invariant.\n\n4. `i4: (c == n) ==> (n > 0)` is partially proven to be inductive. The implication is always true because `n > 0` is a pre-condition and is always true, so this invariant doesn't provide any new information and is unnecessary. We should remove this invariant.\n\nThe assertion `c != n` is partially proven. This is likely because the invariants are not sufficient to prove the assertion. Let's add an invariant to strengthen the existing invariants. We know that `c` will always be less than or equal to `n` in each iteration because `c` can only be incremented when `c > n` and `c` is set to 1 when `c == n`. So, let's add the invariant `c <= n`.\n\nThe corrected loop invariants are:\n\n```c\n/*@ \nloop invariant 0 <= c <= 2*n;\nloop invariant n > 0;\nloop invariant c <= n;\n*/\n```\nThese invariants are true (i) before the loop execution, (ii) in every iteration of the loop and (iii) after the loop termination.
