We can remove the second part of the invariant and keep `1 <= i`.\n\n- The second loop invariant `i2: 0 <= sn && sn == \\at(sn, LoopEntry);` is partially proven to be inductive. The initial value of `sn` is 0, so the invariant `0 <= sn` is true before the loop. However, `sn == \\at(sn, LoopEntry)` is not true in every iteration because `sn` is incremented in the loop.

The second part `i <= size + 1` is true in every iteration because `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration and it will not exceed `size + 1`. The third part `i == sn + 1` is true in every iteration because `i` and `sn` are incremented by the same amount in each iteration. The fourth and fifth parts `sn == \\at(sn, LoopEntry)` and `i == \\at(i, LoopEntry) + 1` are not true in every iteration and we can remove them.\n\n- In order to prove the assertion `sn == 0`, we need to add a loop invariant that relates `sn` and `size`. Since `sn` is incremented in each loop iteration and the loop condition is `i <= size`, at the end of the loop `sn` should be equal to `size`. Therefore, we can add a new loop invariant `sn <= size`.\n\nHere are the corrected loop invariants:\n```c\n/*@ \n  loop invariant 1 <= i;\n  loop invariant 0 <= sn;\n  loop invariant i >= 1 && i <= size + 1 && i == sn + 1;\n  loop invariant sn <= size;\n*/\n```\nThese invariants are true (i) before the loop execution, (ii) in every iteration of the loop and (iii) after the loop termination, such that the loop invariants can be used to prove the assertion(s) that are labeled as \"Unproven\" by Frama-C."
