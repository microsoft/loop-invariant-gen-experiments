                    "Firstly, we observe the initial conditions of the program. At the start of the loop execution, the value of `i` is 1 and `sn` is 0.\n\nThen, we notice that in each iteration of the loop, both `i` and `sn` are incremented by 1. The loop continues until `i` is less than or equal to `size`.\n\nLooking at the loop invariants:\n\n- `i1: 1 <= i` is partially proven to be inductive. Since `i` starts from 1 and only increments in the loop, this invariant should hold. \n- `i2: 0 <= sn` is partially proven to be inductive. Since `sn` starts from 0 and only increments, this invariant should hold.\n- `i3: i <= size + 1` is preserved but not established. This is because `i` might start as greater than `size + 1`. To fix this, we can change the invariant to `i <= \\at(size, LoopEntry) + 1`.\n- `i4: sn <= size` is partially proven to be inductive. Since `sn` starts from 0 and only increments, while `size` is not changed in the loop, this invariant should hold.\n- `i5: sn == i - 1` and `i6: i - 1 == sn` are exactly the same and are partially proven to be inductive. This relationship holds true at the start of the loop and is maintained during the loop because both `i` and `sn` are incremented by 1 in each iteration. We can keep one of these invariants and remove the other.\n- `i7: sn >= 0` is partially proven to be inductive. It's essentially the same as `i2` and can be removed.\n- `i8: sn + i - 1 <= size` is established but not preserved. This invariant may not hold when `i` is incremented but `size` is not. We can replace it with `sn + \\at(i, LoopEntry) - 1 <= \\at(size, LoopEntry)`.\n- `i9: sn + size - i >= 0` is preserved but not established. This invariant may not hold when `i` and `sn` are incremented but `size` is not. We can replace it with `sn + \\at(size, LoopEntry) - \\at(i, LoopEntry) >= 0`.\n\nThe assertion `sn == size` is partially proven.

This means that the invariant `0 <= sn <= size` holds after the loop but it does not hold before the loop begins. To fix this, we need to consider that before the loop begins `size` could be any value, including negative numbers, since it is not explicitly initialized. Hence, we can't guarantee that `0 <= sn <= size` before the loop starts. To establish `i1`, we need to ensure that `0 <= size`.\n\nLoop invariant `i2` is partially proven to be inductive. This means that `sn == i - 1` is inductive, assuming the other invariants are inductive. However, the other invariants are not inductive. To fix this, we need to consider the loop body. After each iteration, both `sn` and `i` are incremented by 1. Therefore, `sn` is always `i - 1` during the loop. This invariant seems to be correct and doesn't need to be changed.\n\nLoop invariant `i3` is partially proven to be inductive. This means that `i == 1 ==> sn == 0` is inductive, assuming the other invariants are inductive. However, the other invariants are not inductive. Given the initial conditions `sn = 0` and `i = 1` and the loop condition `i <= size`, `i` is equal to `1` only in the first iteration of the loop, and `sn` is `0` at that time. Therefore, `i3` is correct and doesn't need to be changed.\n\nAfter the loop, if `sn` is not `0`, the program asserts that `sn` is equal to `size`.
