We can remove this.\n\n4. `i4: n <= 0 ==> x == n`: This invariant is partially proven to be inductive as it depends on `i2`. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, then `x` will be equal to `n` at the end of the loop. \n\n5. `i5: 0 <= x <= n`: This invariant is a conjunction of `i1` and `i2`, and hence, it is partially proven to be inductive.\n\nTo fix these invariants, we need to ensure that `i2` is established before the loop begins. We can add a pre-condition `assume(n >= 0)` to ensure that `n` is always non-negative, which will establish `i2`. \n\nThe corrected invariants are:\n\n```c\nassume(n >= 0);\n\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= x;\n    loop invariant x <= n;\n    loop invariant n <= 0 ==> x == n;\n*/\n```\n\nThese invariants are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination, and they can be used to prove the assertion `n < 0` which is executed when `x != n` after the loop."

However, `n` is not initialized and could contain any value. This is the main reason why the loop invariant `x <= n` is not established.\n\nThe loop invariant `0 <= x` is partially proven to be inductive. It is established before the loop starts because `x` is initialized to 0. It is also preserved by the loop because `x` is only incremented.
