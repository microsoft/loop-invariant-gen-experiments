Loop invariant `i1: y >= \\at(y, LoopEntry)` is partially proven to be inductive. Since `y` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, this invariant is actually inductive. We will keep this invariant as-is.\n\n2. Loop invariant `i2: x + y * (y - \\at(y, LoopEntry)) >= -50` is established but not preserved.
