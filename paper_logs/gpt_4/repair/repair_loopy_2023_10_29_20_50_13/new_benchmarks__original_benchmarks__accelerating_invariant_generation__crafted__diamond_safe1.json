We can do this by adding a clause that checks if `(x % 2) == (y % 2)` before the loop execution:\n\n```\nloop invariant i3: (x % 2) != (y % 2) ==> (x % 2) == 1 || \\at(x, LoopEntry) == 0 && \\at(y, LoopEntry) % 2 == 0 || (x % 2) == (y % 2);\n```\n\nNow, let's check the partially proven invariants i1, i4, i5, and i6. Since i1 is a simple range constraint on x, we can keep it as it is. For i4, i5, and i6, we can merge them into a single invariant that covers all cases:\n\n```\nloop invariant i4: (y % 2 == 0) ==> (x % 2 == 0) || (y % 2 != 0) ==> (x % 2 == 1) || \\at(x, LoopEntry) == 0 && \\at(y, LoopEntry) % 2 == 0;\n```\n\nWith these changes, the corrected loop invariants are:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1: 0 <= x <= 100;\n    loop invariant i2: (x % 2) == (y % 2) ==> (x % 2) == 0 || (x % 2) != (y % 2);\n    loop invariant i3: (x % 2) != (y % 2) ==> (x % 2) == 1 || \\at(x, LoopEntry) == 0 && \\at(y, LoopEntry) % 2 == 0 || (x % 2) == (y % 2);\n    loop invariant i4: (y % 2 == 0) ==> (x % 2 == 0) || (y % 2 != 0) ==> (x % 2 == 1) || \\at(x, LoopEntry) == 0 && \\at(y, LoopEntry) % 2 == 0;\n*/\n```"
