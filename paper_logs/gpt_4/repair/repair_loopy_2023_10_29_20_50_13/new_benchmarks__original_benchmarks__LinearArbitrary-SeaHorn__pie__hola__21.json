If it is not, remove it or replace it with a different inductive invariant.

We can split this invariant into separate invariants for better understanding and try to fix them.\n\nWe have three parts in the invariant `i2`:\n1. `i * c1 <= k <= i * c2`\n2. `k == i * c1 || k == i * c2`\n3. `k == i * c1 + v * (c2 - c1)`\n\nNow, let's analyze each part of the invariant `i2`.\n\n1. `i * c1 <= k <= i * c2`: This part is established and preserved. It holds before the loop and after each loop iteration.\n\n2. `k == i * c1 || k == i * c2`: This part is neither established nor preserved. The value of `k` depends on the value of `v`, which is non-deterministic. We should remove this part from our invariant.\n\n3. `k == i * c1 + v * (c2 - c1)`: This part is established and preserved.
