The loop condition is `unknown_int()`, which means the loop can terminate at any time, and we do not have any information about when it will terminate. Therefore, we have to make sure the invariants hold after every iteration of the loop.\n\nNow, let's fix the non-inductive invariants.\n\n1. loop invariant `x >= 0` is established but not preserved: This is because when `x >= z && w >= y+1` condition is true, `x` is updated to `-x`, which might make it negative. To fix this, we need to add a clause to the invariant that makes it preserved. We can add a clause saying that `x >= 0` or `x <= 0`.\n\n2. loop invariant `y >= 0` is partially proven to be inductive: We need to check the other invariants that this invariant depends on. We can see that the only other invariant that `y >= 0` depends on is `x <= y`. We can check if this invariant is inductive.\n\n3. loop invariant `x <= y` is partially proven to be inductive: This invariant is dependent on the invariant `y >= 0`.

Hence, we cannot use the loop condition in the loop invariants.\n\nNow, we'll fix the invariants according to the Frama-C message:\n\n1. For invariants that are partially proven to be inductive, we will fix the non-inductive invariants that these invariants depend on.\n2. For invariants that are established but not preserved, we will add a clause to the invariant such that the new invariant holds after a loop iteration if it holds before the loop iteration.\n\nHere are the corrected loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0 || x <= 0;\n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n    loop invariant z >= 0;\n    loop invariant w >= 0;\n    loop invariant x <= y;\n    loop invariant y % 2 == 0 || (x >= 4 && y % 2 == 1);\n    loop invariant (x >= 4) ==> (z >= 10 * (x - 4));\n    loop invariant z % 10 == 0;\n    loop invariant (x >= 4) ==> (w >= 10 * (x - 4));\n    loop invariant (x < 4) ==> (y <= 2 * x) || (x >= 4 && y <= 2 * x + 3);\n    loop invariant (x >= 4) ==> (w <= z + 10 * (x - 4) + 10);\n    loop invariant z <= w;\n    loop invariant (x >= 4) ==> (y >= 2 * x - 4);\n    loop invariant (x < 4) ==> (y == 2 * x);\n    loop invariant (x >= 4) ==> (y >= 2 * x);\n    loop invariant (x >= 4) ==> (z <= 10 * (x - 4) + 10);\n    loop invariant (x >= 4) ==> (w <= 10 * (x - 4) + 10);\n*/\n```\nThese loop invariants are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. They are sufficient to verify the assertions in the program."
