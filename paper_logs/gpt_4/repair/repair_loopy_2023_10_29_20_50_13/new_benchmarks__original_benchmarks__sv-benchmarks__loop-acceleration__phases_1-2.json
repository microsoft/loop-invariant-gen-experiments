Let's fix this by converting the boolean expression into an integer using the ternary operator:\n\n```\nloop invariant i6: x % 2 == ((x < 0xfff1) ? 1 : 0);\n```\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop and its conditions. The loop increments `x` by 1 if `x < 0xfff1`, and by 2 otherwise. This means that `x` will be odd when it is less than 0xfff1 and even when it is greater than or equal to 0xfff1.\n\nWith this understanding, let's check the remaining invariants:\n\n- i1, i4, i5, i9 are redundant because they are stating the same bounds on x.\n- i2 and i13 are equivalent and correct as they capture the behavior of x being odd when less than 0xfff1.\n- i3 and i14 are equivalent and correct as they capture the behavior of x being even when greater than or equal to 0xfff1.\n- i7 is incorrect as it negates the condition and the conclusion, but it should only negate the condition.\n- i8, i10, i11, and i12 are incorrect because they contradict the correct invariants i2, i3, i13, and i14.\n\nLet's now simplify the invariants and keep only the correct ones:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= x <= 0x0fffffff;\n    loop invariant (x < 0xfff1) ==> (x % 2 == 1);\n    loop invariant (x >= 0xfff1) ==> (x % 2 == 0);\n    loop invariant x % 2 == ((x < 0xfff1) ? 1 : 0);\n*/\n```"
