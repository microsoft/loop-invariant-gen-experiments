We can keep those invariants and focus on the invariant that is preserved but not established: `p % 2 == 0 && leader_len % 2 == 0`.

Therefore, if `leader_len` is even before the loop starts, it will remain even throughout the loop. Additionally, since `p` is initially set to `leader_len`, if `leader_len` is even, `p` will also be even before the loop starts. Since `p` is incremented by 2 in each iteration of the loop, it will always remain even.\n\nTo fix the invariant that is preserved but not established, we can add a precondition to ensure that `leader_len` is even.
