Since they are all related to the value of `x`, which remains constant during the loop, they should hold true before the loop and after each iteration. We don't need to modify them.\n- `i2`, `i3`, and `i13` are preserved but not established. We need to add clauses that make them hold before the loop begins. Since `i` is not initialized, we cannot make any assumptions about its value before the loop. We can, however, add a clause that `i == 0` at the loop entry. This will make them established.\n- `i4`, `i7`, `i10`, and `i11` are partially proven to be inductive. Since they are related to the values of `i` and `N`, which are not initialized before the loop, we cannot guarantee that they hold true before the loop.

It means that the verifier is able to prove that the invariant is inductive, under the assumption that the other invariants are inductive. We need to fix the other invariants.\n\n2. loop invariant i2: (x == 2) ==> (i >= 0);\n   - This invariant is preserved but not established. We need to add a clause to the invariant to make it established (a clause that makes the invariant hold before the loop begins).\n\n3. loop invariant i3: (NONDET > 0) ==> (x == 1);\n   - This invariant is partially proven to be inductive. Since this invariant depends on the value of NONDET, which could be arbitrary, we need to make sure that the invariant is established before the loop begins.\n\n4. loop invariant i4: (NONDET <= 0) ==> (x == 2);\n   - This invariant is partially proven to be inductive. Similar to i3, this invariant depends on the value of NONDET.
