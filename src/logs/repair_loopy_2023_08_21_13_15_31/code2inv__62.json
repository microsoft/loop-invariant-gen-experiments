We should rewrite the loop invariants without using 'unknown()'. Here's an updated version of the loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1: 0 <= c <= n;\n    loop invariant i2: n > 0;\n    loop invariant i3: \\forall int k; 0 <= k < n ==> (c == n || k != c);\n*/\n```\n\nThese loop invariants should be sufficient to help Frama-C verify the post-condition in the program."
