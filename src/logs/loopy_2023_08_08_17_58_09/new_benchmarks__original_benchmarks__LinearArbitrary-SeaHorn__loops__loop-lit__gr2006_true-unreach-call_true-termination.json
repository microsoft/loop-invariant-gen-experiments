Use implications for the conditional increment/decrement of y: `(x < 50) ==> (y == \\at(y, LoopEntry) + 1)` and `(x >= 50) ==> (y == \\at(y, LoopEntry) - 1)`.\n2. Bound the maximum and minimum values for x and y: `0 <= x <= 100` and `y >= 0`.\n3. Establish a relationship between x and y: When x >= 50, y is always less than or equal to 50, so `x >= 50 ==> y <= 50`.\n4. Use the guard condition for the assertion as an implication: `y < 0 ==> x == 100`.\n\nTaking these points into consideration, the refined loop invariants are:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= x <= 100;\n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n    loop invariant (x < 50) ==> (y == \\at(y, LoopEntry) + 1);\n    loop invariant (x >= 50) ==> (y == \\at(y, LoopEntry) - 1);\n    loop invariant x >= 50 ==> y <= 50;\n    loop assigns x, y;\n    loop variant 100 - x;\n*/\n```"
