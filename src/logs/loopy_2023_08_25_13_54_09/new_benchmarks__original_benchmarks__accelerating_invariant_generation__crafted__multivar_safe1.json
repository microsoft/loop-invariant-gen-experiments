This is true before the loop starts since x is an unsigned int, which cannot be negative. It is also true during the loop because x is incremented until it reaches 100, and it is true after the loop terminates because the loop stops when x is equal to 100.\n\n2. `x == y`: This invariant states that x is always equal to y. This is true before the loop starts because y is assigned the value of x. It is also true during the loop because both x and y are incremented by 1 in each iteration, and it is true after the loop terminates because both variables are incremented the same number of times."
