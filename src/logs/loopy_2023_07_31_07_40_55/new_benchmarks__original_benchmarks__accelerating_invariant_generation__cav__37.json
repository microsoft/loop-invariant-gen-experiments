Before the loop execution: When `x = 0`, `0 <= x && x <= n` holds true, and `m = 0`, so `m >= 0 && m <= x` also holds true. Since `unknown1()` has not been called yet, the implication `(unknown1() != 0) ==> (m == x)` is trivially true.\n2. In every iteration of the loop: If `unknown1()` returns true, `m` is updated to the current value of `x`. Since `x` is increasing in each iteration, `m >= 0 && m <= x` holds true. The loop condition ensures that `x <= n - 1`, so `0 <= x && x <= n` holds true in each iteration. The implication `(unknown1() != 0) ==> (m == x)` holds true because if `unknown1()` returns true, then `m` will be updated to the current value of `x`.\n3. After the loop termination: When the loop terminates, `x` has reached `n`, so `0 <= x && x <= n` still holds true. Since `m` has always been between `0` and `x`, `m >= 0 && m <= x` also holds true after termination. The implication `(unknown1() != 0) ==> (m == x)` is trivially true because the loop has terminated and `unknown1()` is not called anymore.\n\nThese loop invariants imply the post condition, which is that if `x < n` then the program returns, and if `n >= 1` and `(m <= -1 || m >= n)` then the program reaches the ERROR label. The loop invariants ensure that `x` can never be less than `n` and that `m` is always between `0` and `x`, so the post condition is satisfied."
