Before the loop execution:\n   - x is initialized to 0, which is less than or equal to 10.\n   - sn is initialized to 0, which is between 0 and x * a (0 * a = 0).\n\n2. In every iteration of the loop:\n   - x is incremented by 1, so its value remains within the range [0, 10].\n   - If x is less than 10, sn is incremented by a, and the invariant sn == x * a holds.\n   - If x is greater than or equal to 10, sn remains unchanged, and the invariant sn == 0 holds.\n   - sn is always between 0 and x * a since it is incremented by a when x is less than 10.\n\n3. After the loop termination:\n   - The loop never terminates normally (it's a while(1) loop). The only way to exit the loop is through the __VERIFIER_assert function, which checks whether the invariant sn == x * a || sn == 0 holds. If the assertion fails, the program will go to the ERROR label and terminate."
