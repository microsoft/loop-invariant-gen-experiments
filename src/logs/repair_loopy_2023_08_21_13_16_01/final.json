Instead of using the \"loop iteration count\" which is not valid in ACSL, we can use a temporary variable to store the initial value of `x` and `y` before entering the loop, and then use these variables to create the loop invariants. Here is the corrected version of the loop invariants:\n\n```\nint main() {\n  \n  int x;\n  int y;\n  int z1;\n  int z2;\n  int z3;\n  \n  assume((x >= 0));\n  assume((x <= 10));\n  assume((y <= 10));\n  assume((y >= 0));\n\n  int init_x = x;\n  int init_y = y;\n  \n  /*@\n    loop invariant init_x == \\at(x, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant init_y == \\at(y, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n    loop invariant x % 2 == y % 2;\n    loop invariant x <= init_x + 10 * (x - init_x) / 10;\n    loop invariant y <= init_y + 10 * (y - init_y) / 10;\n    loop invariant 0 <= x <= 20;\n    loop invariant 0 <= y <= 20;\n    loop invariant x >= 10 ==> y >= 10;\n    loop invariant 0 <= x <= 20 && x % 10 == 0;\n    loop invariant 0 <= y <= 20 && y % 10 == 0;\n    loop invariant 0 <= x <= 20;\n    loop invariant 0 <= y <= 20;\n    loop invariant x == y;\n  */\n  while (unknown()) {\n    {\n    (x  = (x + 10));\n    (y  = (y + 10));\n    }\n\n  }\n  \n  if ( (x == 20) )\n  {;//@ assert( (y != 0) );\n  }\n\n}\n```\n\nHowever, some of the invariants seem redundant or unnecessary. Let's simplify the loop invariants to what's needed to verify the post-condition:\n\n```\nint main() {\n  \n  int x;\n  int y;\n  int z1;\n  int z2;\n  int z3;\n  \n  assume((x >= 0));\n  assume((x <= 10));\n  assume((y <= 10));\n  assume((y >= 0));\n\n  int init_x = x;\n  int init_y = y;\n  \n  /*@\n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n    loop invariant x % 2 == y % 2;\n    loop invariant 0 <= x <= 20;\n    loop invariant 0 <= y <= 20;\n    loop invariant x >= 10 ==> y >= 10;\n  */\n  while (unknown()) {\n    {\n    (x  = (x + 10));\n    (y  = (y + 10));\n    }\n\n  }\n  \n  if ( (x == 20) )\n  {;//@ assert( (y != 0) );\n  }\n\n}\n```\n\nNow, the loop invariants are more concise and should be sufficient to verify the post-condition in the program."

We can do so by adding a clause that takes into account the cases when c is updated in the loop body. \n\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant c >= 0;\n  loop invariant c <= n + 1;\n  loop invariant n > 0;\n  loop invariant (c == n) || (c > n) || (c < n);\n  loop invariant (c == n) ==> (v1 == 1);\n*/\n```\n\nNow, we have added a new invariant i5 that states if c is equal to n, then v1 is equal to 1. This invariant strengthens the existing invariants and helps to preserve i2. The corrected loop invariants are as follows:\n\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant c >= 0;\n  loop invariant c <= n + 1;\n  loop invariant n > 0;\n  loop invariant (c == n) || (c > n) || (c < n);\n  loop invariant (c == n) ==> (v1 == 1);\n*/\n```"

For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values.

Given a program, you can find loop invariants, which can then be used to verify some property in the program. \nFrama-C is a software verification tool for C programs. The input to Frama-C is a C program file with ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations.\nFor the given program, find the necessary loop invariants of the while loop to help Frama-C verify the post-condition.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. \n- Output loop invariants that are true \n(i) before the loop execution, \n(ii) in every iteration of the loop and \n(iii) after the loop termination, \nsuch that the loop invariants imply the post condition.\n- If a loop invariant is a conjunction, split it into its parts.\n- Output all the loop invariants in one code block. For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values. Do not use variables that have garbage values.**\n- **Do not use keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops.**\n- **Variables that are not explicitly initialized, could have garbage values. Do not make any assumptions about such values.**\n- **Do not use the \\at(x, Pre) notation for any variable x.**\n- **Do not use non-deterministic function calls.**\n"

Given a program, you can find loop invariants, which can then be used to verify some property in the program. \nFrama-C is a software verification tool for C programs. The input to Frama-C is a C program file with ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations.\nFor the given program, find the necessary loop invariants of the while loop to help Frama-C verify the post-condition.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. \n- Output loop invariants that are true \n(i) before the loop execution, \n(ii) in every iteration of the loop and \n(iii) after the loop termination, \nsuch that the loop invariants imply the post condition.\n- If a loop invariant is a conjunction, split it into its parts.\n- Output all the loop invariants in one code block. For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values. Do not use variables that have garbage values.**\n- **Do not use keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops.**\n- **Variables that are not explicitly initialized, could have garbage values. Do not make any assumptions about such values.**\n- **Do not use the \\at(x, Pre) notation for any variable x.**\n- **Do not use non-deterministic function calls.**\n"

Given a program, you can find loop invariants, which can then be used to verify some property in the program. \nFrama-C is a software verification tool for C programs. The input to Frama-C is a C program file with ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations.\nFor the given program, find the necessary loop invariants of the while loop to help Frama-C verify the post-condition.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. \n- Output loop invariants that are true \n(i) before the loop execution, \n(ii) in every iteration of the loop and \n(iii) after the loop termination, \nsuch that the loop invariants imply the post condition.\n- If a loop invariant is a conjunction, split it into its parts.\n- Output all the loop invariants in one code block. For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values. Do not use variables that have garbage values.**\n- **Do not use keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops.**\n- **Variables that are not explicitly initialized, could have garbage values. Do not make any assumptions about such values.**\n- **Do not use the \\at(x, Pre) notation for any variable x.**\n- **Do not use non-deterministic function calls.**\n"
