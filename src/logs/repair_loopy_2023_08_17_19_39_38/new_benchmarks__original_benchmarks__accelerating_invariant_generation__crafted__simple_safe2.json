In ACSL, we don't need to compare the types of variables. So, let's remove that loop invariant. Also, since x is not initialized, it might have a garbage value. We can add a pre-condition to ensure that x is initialized to a valid value. Here's the corrected loop invariants and the pre-condition:\n\n```c\n#define assume(e) if(!(e)) return 0;\n\nint main(void) {\n  unsigned int x;\n  \n  //@ assume x <= 0x0fffffff;\n\n  /*@\n    loop invariant x <= 0x0fffffff;\n  */\n  while (x < 0x0fffffff) {\n    x++;\n  }\n\n  {;//@ assert(x >= 0x0fffffff);\n}\n}\n```\nNow the verifier should be able to prove the inductive loop invariant and the post-condition."
