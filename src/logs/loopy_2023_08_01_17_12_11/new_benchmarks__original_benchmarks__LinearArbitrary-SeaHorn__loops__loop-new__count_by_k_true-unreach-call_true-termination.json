If `k < 0 || k > 10`, the loop will not execute, and `i` will remain `0`.\n- In every iteration of the loop: If `0 <= k && k <= 10`, `i` is incremented by `k`, so it remains within the bounds and a multiple of `k`. If `k < 0 || k > 10`, the loop will not execute.\n- After the loop termination: If `0 <= k && k <= 10`, `i` reaches `LARGE_INT * k`, which satisfies the post-condition. If `k < 0 || k > 10`, the assertion is trivially true because `i` remains `0`.\n\nThese invariants help Frama-C verify the post-condition."
