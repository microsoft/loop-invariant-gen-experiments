Here's the revised loop invariant considering the guidance you provided:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant x <= 0;\n    loop invariant x == 0;\n*/\n```\n\nIn this case, there are no other variables that need to be bounded or related, and there are no guard conditions. Additionally, since the variable `x` is deterministic and well-defined, there is no need to use implications for non-deterministic variables."
