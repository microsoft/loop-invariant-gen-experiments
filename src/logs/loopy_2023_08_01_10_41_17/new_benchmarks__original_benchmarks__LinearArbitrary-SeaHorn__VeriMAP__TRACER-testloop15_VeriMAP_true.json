This is true before the loop execution (since `i` is initialized to 0), during every iteration of the loop (as `i` is incremented by 1 and was initially non-negative), and after the loop termination (since the loop condition is `i < N`, so `i` must be at least 0 when the loop terminates).\n\n2. `i <= N`: This loop invariant states that the value of `i` is always less than or equal to `N`. This is true before the loop execution (since `i` is initialized to 0 and `N` is initialized to 100), during every iteration of the loop (as `i` is incremented by 1 and the loop condition is `i < N`), and after the loop termination (since the loop condition is `i < N`, so `i` must be at most `N` when the loop terminates).\n\n3. `i <= 100`: This loop invariant states that the value of `i` is always less than or equal to 100. This is true before the loop execution (since `i` is initialized to 0), during every iteration of the loop (as `i` is incremented by 1 and the loop condition is `i < N`, where `N` is initialized to 100), and after the loop termination (since the loop condition is `i < N`, so `i` must be at most 100 when the loop terminates).\n\nThese loop invariants ensure the post-condition `!(i > N)` is satisfied, as they imply that `i <= N` after the loop termination."
