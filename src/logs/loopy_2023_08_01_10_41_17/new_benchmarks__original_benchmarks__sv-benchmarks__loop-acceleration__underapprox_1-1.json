The existing loop invariants already capture the necessary information.\n\nHere are the loop invariants for the given program, considering the bounds and relations between x and y:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= x <= 6;\n    loop invariant y == (1 << x);\n*/\n```\n\nThese loop invariants are true before the loop execution, during each iteration, and after loop termination.
