Given a program, you can find loop invariants, which can then be used to verify some property in the program. \nFrama-C is a software verification tool for C programs. The input to Frama-C is a C program file with ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations.\nFor the given program, find the necessary loop invariants of the while loop to help Frama-C verify the post-condition.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. \n- Output loop invariants that are true \n(i) before the loop execution, \n(ii) in every iteration of the loop and \n(iii) after the loop termination, \nsuch that the loop invariants imply the post condition.\n- If a loop invariant is a conjunction, split it into its parts.\n- Output all the loop invariants in one code block. For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values. Do not use variables that have garbage values.**\n- **Do not use keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops.**\n- **Variables that are not explicitly initialized, could have garbage values.

The first loop invariant ensures that i is within the range [1, n+1]. It's true before the loop execution (i == 1), during every iteration (i is incremented by 1), and after loop termination (i == n+1).\n2. The second loop invariant captures the relationship between sn and i. sn is equal to 2 times (i-1) when i is not 4 (which is when sn is changed to -10). When i is greater than 4, sn should be equal to 2*i - 18 (as it was set to -10 when i was 4 and continued incrementing by 2 afterwards). This loop invariant holds before the loop execution (sn == 0 when i == 1), during every iteration, and after loop termination."

After the loop termination:\n   - `sn == n * a || sn == 0`\n\nWith this analysis, the loop invariants for the given program are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 1 <= i && i <= n + 1;\n    loop invariant sn == (i - 1) * a || (i >= 5 && sn == (i - 5) * a - 10);\n*/\n```"

Before the loop execution: i is 1, sn is 0, and both loop invariants hold.\n2. In every iteration of the loop: the invariants hold as sn is incremented by 2 and i is incremented by 1, and the special case for i == 4 is considered.\n3. After the loop termination: the loop invariants imply that sn == n*a or sn == 0, satisfying the post-condition."
