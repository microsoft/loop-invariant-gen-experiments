The loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is a positive integer. In each iteration, `x` is updated with the value `x - y` and then `x` is updated again with the value `x + y`. The key point here is that the value of `y` does not change between these two updates in the same iteration, so the net effect is that `x` remains unchanged after each iteration.\n\nNow let's rewrite the loop invariants for this program:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= i && i <= n;\n    loop invariant x == \\at(x, LoopEntry);\n*/\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. The first loop invariant ensures that `i` is always between 0 and `n`. This is true before the loop, during the loop, and after the loop.\n2. The second loop invariant states that the value of `x` remains unchanged during the loop. This is true because, in each iteration, `x` is updated with the value `x - y`, and then again with the value `x + y`, essentially canceling each other out. This loop invariant is true at the beginning of the loop (LoopEntry), during the loop, and after the loop termination."
