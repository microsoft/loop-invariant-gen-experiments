The additional invariants hold because if `x < 0`, the loop will continue to execute, and the relations between `x` and `y` are maintained.\n- After the loop termination: Since the loop condition is `x < 0`, when the loop terminates, `x >= 0`.

The first two loop invariants are the same as before.\n2. The third loop invariant states that if x >= -15000, then x is always less than or equal to y + \\at(y, Pre) - 15000. This holds true since x increases by y in each iteration, and y starts with a garbage value and increases by 1.\n3. The fourth loop invariant states that if x is still less than 0, y must be greater than 0. This holds true because y increases by 1 in each iteration, and when x is no longer less than 0, the loop terminates, and the post-condition (y > 0) must be satisfied."
