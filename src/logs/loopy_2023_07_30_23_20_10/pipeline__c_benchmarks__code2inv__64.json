The first invariant (1 <= x && x <= 11) bounds the values x can take. The second invariant (x < 11 ==> y == 10 - (x-1)) describes the relationship between x and y when x is less than 11. The third invariant (x == 11 ==> y >= 0 && y < 10) accounts for the post-condition when the loop terminates with x equal to 11."
