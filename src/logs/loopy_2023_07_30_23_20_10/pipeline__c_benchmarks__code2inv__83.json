Given a program, you can find loop invariants, which can then be used to verify some property in the program. \nFrama-C is a software verification tool for C programs. The input to Frama-C is a C program file with ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations.\nFor the given program, find the necessary loop invariants of the while loop to help Frama-C verify the post-condition.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. \n- Output loop invariants that are true \n(i) before the loop execution, \n(ii) in every iteration of the loop and \n(iii) after the loop termination, \nsuch that the loop invariants imply the post condition.\n- If a loop invariant is a conjunction, split it into its parts.\n- Output all the loop invariants in one code block. For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values. Do not use variables that have garbage values.**\n- **Do not use keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops.**\n- **Variables that are not explicitly initialized, could have garbage values. Do not make any assumptions about such values.**\n- **Do not use the \\at(x, Pre) notation for any variable x.**\n- **Do not use non-deterministic function calls.**\n"

The first loop invariant `x + y * (y - 1) / 2 == -5000` represents the sum of an arithmetic progression with the first term equal to `x` and the common difference equal to `y`. This invariant is true before the loop execution since `x = -5000` and `y * (y - 1) / 2 = 0`. It holds during every iteration of the loop as `x` is updated with `x + y`, and `y` is incremented by 1. After the loop termination, this invariant implies the post-condition `y > 0`.\n\n2. The second loop invariant `x < 0` is the loop condition itself. It holds before the loop execution and during every iteration of the loop. After the loop termination, this invariant is no longer true since the loop will exit when `x >= 0`.\n\n3. The third loop invariant `y >= 0` is true before the loop execution, since `y` is uninitialized and contains a garbage value. It holds during every iteration of the loop, as `y` is incremented by 1 in the loop body. After the loop termination, this invariant is still true, as `y` will be a non-negative integer."
