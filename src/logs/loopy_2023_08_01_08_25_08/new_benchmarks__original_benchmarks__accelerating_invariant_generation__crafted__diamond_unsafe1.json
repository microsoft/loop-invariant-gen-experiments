The loop invariant `0 <= x <= 99` ensures that x is always within the range of 0 to 99 during the loop execution. This is true before the loop execution (as x is initialized to 0), in every iteration of the loop (as x is incremented by either 1 or 2), and after the loop termination (as the loop condition is x < 99).\n\n2. The loop invariant `(y % 2 == 0) ==> (x % 2 == 0)` uses implication to ensure that if y is even (y % 2 == 0), then x is also even (x % 2 == 0) during the loop execution. This is true before the loop execution (as x is initialized to 0 and y has a garbage value), in every iteration of the loop (as x is incremented by 1 if y is even), and after the loop termination (which implies the post condition).\n\n3. The loop invariant `(y % 2 != 0) ==> (x % 2 == 1)` uses implication to ensure that if y is odd (y % 2 != 0), then x is also odd (x % 2 == 1) during the loop execution. This is true before the loop execution (as x is initialized to 0 and y has a garbage value), in every iteration of the loop (as x is incremented by 2 if y is odd), and after the loop termination (which implies the post condition)."

If y is non-zero, then the parity of x and y remains the same throughout the loop.\n\nThese loop invariants hold true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.
