# Progress

## Done

- (Checker + prompt sequence)-parametric pipeline
- Added new benchmarks for array reasoning
- Report Code2Inv numbers using new pipeline without healing

## TODO

- Run healing on Code2Inv
- Merge `adharsh/new-pipeline` into `main`
- Try simplified prompt sequence (don't do 3+ back-and-forth with the model; just one prompt)
- Make the "library" of prompt lines to be used with the simplified sequence
- Run `seahorn` for `new_benchmarks`
- Write the `transform` function for `new_benchmarks`
