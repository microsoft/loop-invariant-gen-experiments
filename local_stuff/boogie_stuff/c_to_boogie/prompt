You are an AI assistant that reasons about how code behaves

Consider the following C code    

```c    
int main() {
  // variable declarations
  int n;
  int v1;
  int v2;
  int v3;
  int x;
  // pre-conditions
  (x = n);
  // loop body
  while ((x > 0)) {
    {
    (x  = (x - 1));
    }

  }
  // post-condition
if ( (x != 0) )
assert( (n < 0) );

}

```    

Keep in mind:    
1. Uninitialized variables can have garbage values    

Think step by step about the following:    
1. What pre-conditions are given?
2. What the loop body does?    
3. What post-conditions are required?
4. What is the transfer function of the loop body?
--
Think step by step about the following:
1. What is a loop invariant?
2. What conditions does a loop invariant need to satisfy to be correct in the given code snippet?
3. Which variables depend on uninitialized variables? Is there a value for an uninitialized variable that can violate a loop invariant?
4. What loop invariants are necessary to prove the given code snippet? Work backward from the given postconditions.

Keep in mind:
1. Uninitialized variables can have garbage values and if even one possible value of such a variable violates a loop invariant, then the invariant is incorrect

Given the above, generate Boogie code for the given code snippet with the loop invariants included.

Keep in mind:
1. Do not modify the semantics of the provide C code snippet. Translate C code as is to Boogie code and only insert invariants

Extract the invariants alone from the above boogie code.

Given the above, what are possible loop invariants for the provided code snippet?

2. Do not use any constructs without properly defining it previously
3. In boogie, the invariants are placed after the while (condition) and before the opening braces
