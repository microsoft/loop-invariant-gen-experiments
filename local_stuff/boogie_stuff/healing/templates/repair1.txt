Boogie is a software verification tool that given a program and a specification, attempts to prove that the program satisfies the specification. Boogie is a first-order language with a C-like syntax. Boogie is an intermediate language that is used by other tools such as the Z3 SMT solver and the Dafny programming language.

You are given the following Boogie code with incorrect or insufficient loop invariants along with the error returned by the Boogie verifier upon attempted verification. The objective is to fix or complete the invariants so that the Boogie verifier can successfully verify the given code.

Code:
```boogie
{{ boogie_code }}
```

Error:
```
{{ boogie_error }}
```

Let's think step by step. First, note that the error message indicates that the following invariants are wrong.

```
{{ incorrect_invariants }}
```

What is the error message indicating about these invariants?
