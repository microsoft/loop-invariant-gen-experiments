Great. Let's think step by step. Now, how can we fix these invariants? Note that only changing the loop invariants written as 'invariant ...' is allowed. Changing the semantics of the original program is not allowed. The following hints might help as well:

1. If the invariant cannot be proved on loop entry, could you alter the invariant to conditionally hold only after loop entry by adding an implies clause? Or, could you alter the invariant to hold on loop entry as well?
2. If the invariant could not be proven to be maintained, could you make the invariant stronger or fix it in another way?
3. If the assertion i.e. the postcondition could not be proved, could you add more loop invariants or make the existing invariants stronger?
