The given code contains a non-terminating loop, and it is not possible to provide a loop invariant that would satisfy the post-condition. The loop will continue indefinitely as x2 will always be non-negative since it is initialized to 0 and incremented by x1, which is also non-negative. The post-condition asserts that x2 >= 0, which will always be true, but the loop will never terminate to reach the post-condition.
