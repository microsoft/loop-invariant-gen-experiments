For the first iteration of the loop:\nThe invariants in the first iteration are: \n- `k == 0`: True at the beginning as `k` is initialized to 0.\n- `(m < a) -> (m == a)`: If `m < a` is true, then after the loop body executes, `m` will be set to the value of `a`.\n\n3. There is no second iteration of the loop since the loop condition is `k < 1`, and the value of `k` increments to 1 after the first iteration.\n\n4. After the loop finishes:\nThe loop invariants after the loop finishes are:\n- `k == 1`: True as `k` increments to 1 after the first iteration of the loop, and the loop terminates.\n- `(m < a) -> (m == a)`: If `m < a` was true at the beginning of the loop, then the loop body would have set `m` to the value of `a`, and this relationship holds true after the loop finishes.\n\nNote that these loop invariants are subject to the fact that `a` and `m` are uninitialized and can have garbage values.
