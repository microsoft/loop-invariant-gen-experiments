So, if sn == i - 1 holds true before an iteration, it will still hold true after the iteration.\n- When the loop terminates (i > 8), the invariant sn == i - 1 helps us deduce that sn == 8, which is a useful property for ensuring the correctness of the algorithm.\n\nNow let's check the loop invariants at each stage:\n\n1. Before the loop starts:\n   sn = 0, i = 1, so the invariant sn == i - 1 holds (0 == 1 - 1).\n\n2.
