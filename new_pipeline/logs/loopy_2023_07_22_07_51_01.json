If the condition is true, the value of `z` is assigned to `y`.\n\n3.

This assertion is checked only if `size` is greater than 0. Note that since `size` is uninitialized, it could be negative, zero, or positive, and thus the assertion may or may not be checked.\n\nIn summary, the given code has uninitialized variables, making its behavior unpredictable.
