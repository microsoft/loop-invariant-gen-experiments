For the first iteration of the loop:\n   - The loop body increments both `sn` and `x` by 1: `(x = (x + 1))` and `(sn = (sn + 1))`.\n   - Since both `sn` and `x` were initially 0, after the first increment, they both become 1.\n   - So, the invariant `sn == x` holds true (1 == 1).\n\n3. For the second iteration of the loop:\n   - The loop body again increments both `sn` and `x` by 1.\n   - Since both `sn` and `x` were 1 at the end of the first iteration, after the second increment, they both become 2.\n   - So, the invariant `sn == x` holds true (2 == 2).\n\n4. After the loop finishes:\n   - The loop continues to increment `sn` and `x` by the same amount until `unknown()` returns a false (zero) value.\n   - At each iteration, both `sn` and `x` are incremented by 1, maintaining the invariant `sn == x`.\n   - When the loop terminates, the invariant `sn == x` still holds true.\n   - The post-condition checks this invariant when `sn` is not equal to -1: `if ( (sn != -1) ) assert( (sn == x) );`\n\nIn summary, the loop invariant `sn == x` is valid before the loop starts, during each iteration of the loop, and after the loop finishes.
