The loop counter `i` is always in the range [0, 1024], so we keep the first invariant `0 <= i <= 1024`.\n2. The second invariant states that for every integer `j` in the range [0, i), `A[j]` is equal to `j`. This is true before the loop (no elements are assigned yet), during every iteration (A[i] = i), and after the loop termination (A[j] = j for j in the range [0, 1024)).\n3. The third invariant `i <= 2047` bounds the maximum value `i` can take (2047 is the highest index in the array A).\n4. The fourth invariant `i >= 0` bounds the minimum value `i` can take (0 is the lowest index in the array A).\n\nThese invariants are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.
