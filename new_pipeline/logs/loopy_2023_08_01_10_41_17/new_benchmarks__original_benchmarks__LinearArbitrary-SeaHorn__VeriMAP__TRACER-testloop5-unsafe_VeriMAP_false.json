The loop condition is `foo(i) < 10`.\n\nThe function `foo()` increases the value of `i` by 1 in each iteration. Since the loop condition is `foo(i) < 10`, we can deduce that the value of `i` at the loop termination will be 9. Also, as `i` starts from 0 and gets incremented in each iteration, the value of `i` will always be less than 10.\n\nNow, we can output the revised loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= i;\n    loop invariant i < 10;\n    loop invariant foo(i) == i + 1;\n    loop invariant foo(i) < 10 ==> i == 9;\n*/\n```\n\nThese loop invariants hold true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. They ensure that the post-condition `!(i == 10)` is true. The invariants include the bounds of the variable `i`, the relation between `i` and `foo(i)`, and the implication for the loop termination condition."

This invariant helps us to ensure that `i` is not equal to 10 when the loop terminates.\n\nThese loop invariants satisfy the requirements mentioned in the prompt and help Frama-C verify the post-condition."
