Based on your instructions, let's rewrite the loop invariant for the given program. \n\nSince the loop invariant should hold for both the loop body and the post-condition where a == 6, we can use the implication (==>) to incorporate the guard condition. \n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= a <= 6;\n    loop invariant a < 6 ==> a != 6;\n*/\n```\n\nThese loop invariants satisfy the given conditions:\n- Before the loop execution: a is initialized to 0, which satisfies both invariants.\n- In every iteration of the loop: The loop condition ensures that a is always less than 6. And since a is incremented by 1 in each iteration, it always remains non-negative. The second invariant holds because a cannot be 6 while the loop condition is true.\n- After the loop termination: When the loop terminates, the value of a is 6, which still satisfies the first loop invariant. The second loop invariant becomes trivially true since the condition (a < 6) is false."

There is no other variable in the loop, and since the assertion is not guarded by a condition, no implication is needed. \n\nHowever, to address your point about using implication in case of non-deterministic values at the beginning or end of the loop, I will show you how to use it in the given example. In this case, the variable `a` is initialized, so it does not have non-deterministic values. But for the sake of demonstration, let's consider that `a` is non-deterministic at the beginning of the loop.\n\nHere's the updated loop invariant using implication:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant a_is_non_det_at_begin ==> 0 <= a;\n    loop invariant 0 <= a <= 6;\n*/\n```\n\nIn this example, `a_is_non_det_at_begin` is a hypothetical boolean variable representing whether `a` is non-deterministic at the beginning of the loop. The first invariant says that if `a` is non-deterministic at the beginning of the loop, then it must be greater than or equal to 0. The second invariant states that `a` must always be within the range of 0 to 6 during the loop. Note that in the actual code, `a` is initialized, so the first invariant would not be necessary."
