Since y < 1024, the implication (y < 1024) ==> (x == 0) is trivially true, as x is 1.\n- In every iteration of the loop: y is incremented by 1, and x is set to 0. So, y is always less than or equal to 1024 (0 <= y <= 1024), and when y < 1024, x is 0 ((y < 1024) ==> (x == 0)).\n- After the loop termination: The loop terminates when y >= 1024. At this point, x should be 0, which is the post-condition we want to verify. The loop invariants imply this post-condition, as (y == 1024) ==> (x == 0) is true, and y == 1024, so x must be 0."
