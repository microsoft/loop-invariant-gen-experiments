Given the new instructions, let's analyze the given C program again and find the necessary loop invariants for the while loop.\n\n```\nextern void abort(void);\nextern void __assert_fail(const char *, const char *, unsigned int, const char *) __attribute__ ((__nothrow__ , __leaf__)) __attribute__ ((__noreturn__));\nvoid reach_error() { __assert_fail(\"0\", \"while_infinite_loop_2.c\", 3, \"reach_error\"); }\n\nvoid __VERIFIER_assert(int cond) {\n  if (!(cond)) {\n    ERROR: {reach_error();abort();}\n  }\n  return;\n}\nint main() {\n  int x=0;\n\n  while(true)\n  {\n    __VERIFIER_assert(x==0);    \n  }\n\n  __VERIFIER_assert(x==0);\n}\n```\n\nThere are no additional bounds, implications, or relations needed for this specific program, as the loop is infinite, and the loop invariant is already established as `x == 0`. The loop condition is `while(true)`, which means the loop will never terminate. Since the loop will never terminate, we don't need to worry about any implications or relations.\n\nThe loop invariants remain the same:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x == 0;\n*/\n```\n\nThese loop invariants are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination (although the loop never terminates). They imply the post condition of `__VERIFIER_assert(x==0);`."
