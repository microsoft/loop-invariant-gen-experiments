Add conjunctions that bound the maximum and minimum values that they can take, if such bounds exist.\n- For the given program, there are no specific bounds on the variables x and y.\n\n3. If a variable is always equal to or smaller or larger than another variable, add a conjunction for their relation.\n- The loop invariant x >= y already captures the relation between x and y.\n\n4. If the assertion is guarded by a condition, use the guard condition in an implication.\n- The given program does not have a guard condition for the assertion.\n\n5. If certain variables are non-deterministic at the beginning or end of the loop, use an implication to make the invariant trivially true at that location.\n- In this case, the loop condition is non-deterministic (__VERIFIER_nondet_bool()), but the loop invariants x >= y and y >= 0 still hold.\n\nConsidering the above guidelines, the loop invariants remain the same:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= y;\n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n*/\n```"
