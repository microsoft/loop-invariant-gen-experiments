For the second iteration of the loop:\n   At the beginning of the second iteration, the loop invariant is `(x == n - 1) && (x > 0)`.

Note that this loop invariant, combined with the post-condition `(x != 0)`, implies that `n` must be less than 0.\n\nKeep in mind that the loop invariants mentioned here are valid for each stage of the loop, and they are maintained throughout the loop execution.
