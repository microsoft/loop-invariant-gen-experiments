For the second iteration of the loop:\n   - `z >= y && z <= y+1`\n   - This invariant holds because `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, and the condition `z <= y` ensures that `y` is at least as large as `z`. Therefore, if `z` is increased by 1, then `y` must also be increased by 1 to satisfy the invariant.\n   \n4. After the loop finishes:\n   - `z >= y`\n   - This invariant holds because the loop can only terminate when `x` is greater than or equal to 5, and so the loop body is executed at most 5 times.
