The fourth invariant is an attempt to express the relationship between `x` and `y` more explicitly but may not be correct or strong enough.\n\nWe can try adding another loop invariant that captures the relationship between `x` and `y` at the end of the loop, when `y` reaches `100000`.

It states that if `y` is less than 100000, then the sum of `x` and the remaining terms `(100000 - y) * (100000 - y + 1)/2` should equal the expected final value of `x`.
