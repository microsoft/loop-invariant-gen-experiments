In every iteration of the loop, the `foo()` function is called, which decrements `x` by 1. Since `x` is always positive before the decrement, the invariant `x >= 0` holds in every iteration. After the loop termination, the loop condition `x > 0` becomes false, which implies `x <= 0`.\n\n- The loop invariant `c ==> 1` states that whenever the non-deterministic boolean `c` is true, the value of `1` (true) holds. This is trivially true because `c` being true implies that the condition is true. This invariant holds before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\n- The loop invariant `!c ==> 1` states that whenever the non-deterministic boolean `c` is false, the value of `1` (true) holds. This is also trivially true because `c` being false implies that the condition is true. This invariant holds before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nThese loop invariants satisfy the conditions mentioned in the instructions and help Frama-C verify the post-condition `x <= 0`."
