This is true before the loop execution, in every iteration, and after the loop termination.\n- The second loop invariant states that n is always non-negative and less than or equal to k. This is true before the loop execution, in every iteration, and after the loop termination.\n- The third loop invariant states that if i is even, then n is equal to i/2. This is because n is incremented every time i is even, and there are i/2 even numbers in the range [0, i). This invariant is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n- The fourth loop invariant states that if i is odd, then n is equal to (i-1)/2. This is because n is incremented every time i is even, and there are (i-1)/2 even numbers in the range [0, i). This invariant is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination."
