Based on your guidelines, the loop invariants can be updated as follows:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= i;\n    loop invariant i <= LARGE_INT;\n    loop invariant i != LARGE_INT ==> i <= LARGE_INT;\n*/\n```\n\nThese loop invariants are true:\n(i) before the loop execution (since `i` is initialized to 0),\n(ii) in every iteration of the loop (since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration and checked against `LARGE_INT`), and\n(iii) after the loop termination (when `i` becomes equal to `LARGE_INT`).\n\nThe third invariant captures the implication based on the loop condition `i != LARGE_INT`. When `i` is not equal to `LARGE_INT`, it implies that `i` is less than or equal to `LARGE_INT`. This invariant is trivially true when `i` becomes equal to `LARGE_INT` after the loop termination."

As there are no other variables or conditions involved in the given code, no additional conjunctions or implications are required."
