It is true before the loop execution (since `len` is initialized to 0), in every iteration of the loop (as `len` is reset to 0 when it reaches 4 and incremented by 1 otherwise), and after the loop termination.\n2. `len < 4 ==> a[len] == 0`: This loop invariant states that if `len` is less than 4, then the value at index `len` in the array `a` is set to 0. This invariant is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop (since `a[len]` is set to 0), and after the loop termination.\n3. `len == 4 ==> a[0] == 0`: This loop invariant states that if `len` is equal to 4, then the value at index 0 in the array `a` is set to 0. This invariant is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop (since `len` is reset to 0 when it reaches 4), and after the loop termination.\n\nThese loop invariants imply the post-condition `len >= 0 && len < 5`."
