This helps in establishing the relationship between `x` and other non-negative integer values. Since `x` is decremented in each loop iteration, it will eventually become non-positive, causing the loop to terminate. After the loop terminates, we can deduce that `x == 0`."

Here are the updated loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant 0 <= x;\n  loop invariant \\forall integer y; 0 <= y && y < x ==> (foo() == --y);\n*/\n```\n\nThese loop invariants are true because:\n\n(i) Before the loop execution, x is assigned a non-deterministic integer value, so it may be positive, negative or zero. Since the loop only executes if x > 0, we can conclude that x will always be non-negative before entering the loop.\n\n(ii) In every iteration of the loop, the function foo() is called, which decrements x by 1. Since the loop condition is x > 0, x will remain non-negative in every iteration. The second invariant states that for any integer y in the range [0, x), after foo() is called, y is decremented by 1. This is true because foo() always decrements x by 1 in each iteration.\n\n(iii) After the loop termination, the loop invariants ensure that x is non-negative, which combined with the loop condition (x > 0) implies that x is 0. This is the desired post-condition. The second invariant becomes trivially true at this point, as there are no integers y in the range [0, 0)."

It states that if `c` is true or false, x is non-negative. Since `c` is a non-deterministic Boolean, this invariant ensures that x remains non-negative regardless of the value of `c`.\n- There are no other variables that require bounds or relations in this program, as only `x` and `c` are involved in the loop, and `c` is non-deterministic.\n- The guard condition for the assertion is the termination of the loop, which is already covered by the first loop invariant `x >= 0`.\n\nWith these loop invariants, Frama-C can verify the post-condition that x equals 0 after the loop termination."
