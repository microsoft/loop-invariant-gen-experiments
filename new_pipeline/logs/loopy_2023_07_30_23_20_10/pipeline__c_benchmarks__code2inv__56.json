If unknown() is false, this invariant is trivially true.\n7. `!unknown() ==> (v3 == c)`: If the unknown() function returns false, then v3 is assigned the value of c. If unknown() is true, this invariant is trivially true.\n\nPlease note that the use of v1, v2, and v3 is incorrect as they are not declared in the program. However, I provided them as per your request to demonstrate the use of implications with non-deterministic variables. In practice, we should not use undeclared variables in loop invariants."
