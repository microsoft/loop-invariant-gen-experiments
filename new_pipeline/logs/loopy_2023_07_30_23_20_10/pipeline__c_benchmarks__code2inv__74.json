This is true before the loop (z = 36 * y and c = 0), and during each iteration (if c < 36, z is incremented by 1 and c is incremented by 1, maintaining the relationship).\n3. c < 36 ==> z < 36 * (c + 1): This invariant implies that if c is less than 36, then z must be less than 36 times (c + 1). This is true at the beginning (when c = 0) and during each iteration when c < 36, as z is incremented by 1 and c is incremented by 1.\n4. c == 36 ==> z >= 36 * y: This invariant implies that if c reaches 36, then z must be greater than or equal to 36 times y, which is the initial value of z before the loop.
