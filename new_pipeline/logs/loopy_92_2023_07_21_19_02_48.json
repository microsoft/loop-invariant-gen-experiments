So, the invariant `3 * i == x + y` translates to `3 * 1 == x + y` and holds true.\n\n3. For the second iteration of the loop:\nAt the second iteration, the value of `i` is incremented by 1 again. Similar to the first iteration, no matter the outcome of `unknown()`, the sum of the increments of `x` and `y` is 3. So, the invariant `3 * i == x + y` translates to `3 * 2 == x + y` and holds true.\n\n4. After the loop finishes:\nWhen the loop terminates, `i` will be equal to `n`. At this point, the invariant `3 * i == x + y` translates to `3 * n == x + y`. This is the same as the post-condition `assert((3 * n) == (x + y))`, which ensures the correctness of the algorithm.\n\nIn conclusion, the loop invariant `3 * i == x + y` holds true before the loop starts, for each iteration of the loop, and after the loop finishes, satisfying all three conditions for a correct loop invariant."
