Loop body:\nThe loop body contains a single statement within the `while` loop. The loop runs while the value of `x` is less than `y`. In each iteration of the loop, the value of `x` is doubled (i.e., `x` is updated as `x = x + x`). The loop will continue to execute as long as the condition `x < y` remains true. Since `y` is uninitialized, the behavior of the loop can be unpredictable depending on the initial garbage value of `y`.\n\n3. Post-conditions:\nThe post-condition given in the code is that the value of `x` must be greater than or equal to 1. This is ensured by the `assert` statement, which checks if the condition `(x >= 1)` is true. If the condition is false, the program will terminate with an assertion failure. Due to the pre-condition of `x` being assigned the value 1 and the loop body only increasing the value of `x`, the post-condition `(x >= 1)` will always hold true."

After the loop finishes:\n   - `x` will be greater than or equal to `y`, as this is the condition for the loop to terminate.\n   - `x >= 1`, as ensured by the post-condition.\n\nAt each step, one of the loop invariants is that `x` is always a non-negative integer and a power of 2.

For the second iteration of the loop:\n   - `x >= 1`, as the value of `x` continues to increase within the loop.\n   - `x` is a power of `2`, as the loop continues to double the value of `x`.\n\n4. After the loop finishes:\n   - `x >= 1`, since the loop will only terminate when the value of `x` is no longer less than `y` and `x` has been increasing throughout the loop.\n   - `x` is a power of `2`, as the loop was doubling the value of `x` in each iteration.\n   - `x >= y`, as the loop condition `x < y` becomes false, causing the loop to terminate.\n\nIn summary, the loop invariants for this code snippet are:\n- `x >= 1`\n- `x` is a power of `2`\nThese invariants hold true before the loop starts, during each iteration, and after the loop finishes."
