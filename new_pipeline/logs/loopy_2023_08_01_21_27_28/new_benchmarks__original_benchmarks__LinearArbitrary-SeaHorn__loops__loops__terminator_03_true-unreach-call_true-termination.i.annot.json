The first invariant, y > 0, remains the same as before.\n\n2. The second invariant, x < 100 ==> x + y >= 100, now uses implication to take care of the loop condition. It states that when x is less than 100 (i.e., the loop is still running), x + y must be greater than or equal to 100.\n\n3. The third invariant, x >= 0, bounds the minimum value x can take. Since x is initialized with a non-deterministic integer value, we cannot guarantee its exact value, but this invariant holds for all possible values of x.\n\n4. The fourth invariant, y <= 1000000, states the maximum value y can take, which is given as a pre-condition before the loop.\n\n5. The fifth invariant, x <= x + y, establishes the relationship between x and y, stating that x is always less than or equal to x + y. This holds since y > 0, and x is incremented by y in each iteration.\n\nThese loop invariants are true (i) before the loop execution, (ii) in every iteration of the loop, and (iii) after the loop termination, and they help Frama-C verify the post-condition."

In every iteration of the loop: If y > 0, x is incremented by y, and since y > 0, the loop invariant 0 <= x is maintained; x will always be less than or equal to y * (1000000 / y) + 100.
