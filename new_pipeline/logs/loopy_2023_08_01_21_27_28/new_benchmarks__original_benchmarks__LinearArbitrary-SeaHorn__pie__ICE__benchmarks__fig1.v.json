It represents the minimum possible sum that can be obtained from adding y to x in each iteration. This bound ensures that x increases enough to eventually terminate the loop.\n- The fourth invariant states that x, after adding the sum of the first y-1 natural numbers, is greater than or equal to its initial value (-50). This bound ensures that x does not increase too much.\n\nThese improved loop invariants provide a more complete description of the variables' relationships and bounds, making it easier for Frama-C to verify the post-condition."

In each iteration, x is increased by y, and y is increased by 1, so the sum of x and y will always be greater than or equal to -50.\n4. `(x >= 0) ==> (x + y <= -50)`: This invariant takes care of the implication. When the loop terminates, x will be non-negative (0 or greater). This invariant states that if x is non-negative, then the sum of x and y must be less than or equal to -50. This ensures that y remains non-negative after the loop termination.\n\nNote: We don't need to add conjunctions for the maximum and minimum values of v1, v2, and v3, as they are non-deterministic and not involved in the loop condition or post-condition."

Since `x` starts at `-50` and increases, and `y` starts at an uninitialized value and only increases, the sum of `x` and `y` must be between `-50` and `0` as long as `x` is greater than or equal to `-50`.
