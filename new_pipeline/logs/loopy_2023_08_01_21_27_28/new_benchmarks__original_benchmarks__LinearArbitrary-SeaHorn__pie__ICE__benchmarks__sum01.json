This is true because the loop increments `sn` by `a` in each iteration, and the maximum value it can reach is `n*a`.\n\n4. `loop invariant sn >= 0;`: This invariant states that the value of `sn` is always greater than or equal to 0. This is true because `sn` starts with a value of 0 and is incremented by `a` (which is 1) in each iteration.\n\n5. `loop invariant n >= 0 ==> sn == n*a || sn == 0;`: This invariant uses implication to express that if `n` is greater than or equal to 0, the assertion `sn == n*a || sn == 0` holds.\n\n6. `loop invariant n < 0 ==> sn == 0;`: This invariant uses implication to express that if `n` is less than 0, the assertion `sn == 0` holds.
