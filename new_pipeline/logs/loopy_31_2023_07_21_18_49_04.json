Thus, the invariant `x = n - k` holds true.\n\n3. For the second iteration of the loop:\nWhen the second iteration occurs, the value of `x` is decremented by 1 again, so `x = n - 2`. At this point, `k = 2` (since the loop has executed twice). Thus, the invariant `x = n - k` holds true.\n\n4. After the loop finishes:\nThe loop terminates when `x <= 1`. At this point, `k = n - x` (since the invariant `x = n - k` holds). Since the loop has finished executing, we can use the invariant to prove the post-condition. If `n >= 0`, the post-condition asserts that `x == 1`. The loop invariant helps us understand that the value of `x` will indeed be 1 after the loop finishes, given that `n` is non-negative.\n\nNote that for negative values of `n`, the loop will not execute at all, and the post-condition does not apply.

After the loop finishes:\nWhen the loop terminates, the condition `x > 1` is no longer true, which means `x <= 1`. Since the loop only stops when `x` is less than or equal to 1 and `x` is initially set to `n`, we can say that the final loop invariant is `x <= 1`.
