Only changing the loop invariants written as 'invariant ...' is allowed. The following hints might help:\n\nIf it is an invariant error:\n1. If the invariant cannot be proved on loop entry, could you alter the invariant to conditionally hold only after loop entry by adding an implies clause? Or, could you alter the invariant to hold on loop entry as well?\n2. If the invariant could not be proven to be maintained, could you make the invariant stronger or fix it in another way?\n3. If the assertion i.e. the postcondition could not be proved, could you add more loop invariants or make the existing invariants stronger?\n4. Would expression rewriting for the invariants help? Eg. converting division to multiplication\n\nIf it is a syntax error:\n- '/' is not a valid division operator. Replace the '/' operator with 'div'\n- '%' is not a valid modulus operator. Replace the '%' operator with 'mod'\n- '=' is not a valid equality operator. Replace the '=' operator with '=='\n- Composing inequality operators is not allowed. Break it up into the constituent inequalities. Eg. 0 <= x <= 1 is not allowed. Instead, (0 <= x) && (x <= 1) is allowed\n\nKeep in mind:\n1. Changing the semantics of the original program is not allowed\n2. You are allowed to attempt fixes beyond the given hints to the invariants\n3. Disjunctive invariants are allowed\n4. You are allowed to remove invariants that are incorrect"

Currently, the loop invariants are:\n\n1. x >= y\n2. x == (y * (y + 1)) div 2\n3. y >= 0\n\nThe first and third invariants seem to be correct, as they hold on loop entry and are maintained throughout the loop. However, the second invariant seems to be incorrect. Let's fix it:\n\nThe value of `x` is incremented by `y` in each iteration of the loop, which means the sum of all the values of `y` from 0 to the current value of `y` would be equal to the value of `x`. This can be expressed as the sum of an arithmetic series. The correct formula for the sum of an arithmetic series from 1 to n is `(n * (n + 1)) div 2`. In our case, since we start at 0, the formula should be `((y - 1) * y) div 2`. Thus, the second invariant should be:\n\n2. x == ((y - 1) * y) div 2\n\nLet's update the loop invariants and see if the Boogie verifier can successfully verify the code:\n\n```boogie\nprocedure main() {\nvar nondet: bool;\nvar x: int;\nvar y: int;\nx := 1;\ny := 0;\nwhile(y < 100000)\n// insert invariants \ninvariant x >= y;\ninvariant x == ((y - 1) * y) div 2;\ninvariant y >= 0;\n{\nx := x + y;\ny := y + 1;\n}\nassert(x >= y);\n}\n```\n\nWith these updated loop invariants, the Boogie verifier should be able to successfully verify the given code."
