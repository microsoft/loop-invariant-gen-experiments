Before the loop starts:\n   - The value of `x` is 1.\n   - The value of `y` is 0.\n   - The value of `x` is greater than or equal to `y`.\n\n   So a valid loop invariant before the loop starts could be `(x == 1) && (y == 0) && (x >= y)`.\n\n2. For the first iteration of the loop:\n   - The value of `x` is updated by adding `y` to it, i.e., `x = x + y`.\n   - The value of `y` is incremented by 1, i.e., `y = y + 1`.\n   - The value of `x` is still greater than or equal to `y`.\n\n   So a valid loop invariant for the first iteration of the loop could be `(x == 1 + 0) && (y == 0 + 1) && (x >= y)`.\n\n3. For the second iteration of the loop:\n   - The value of `x` is updated by adding the new value of `y` to it, i.e., `x = x + y`.\n   - The value of `y` is incremented by 1, i.e., `y = y + 1`.\n   - The value of `x` is still greater than or equal to `y`.\n\n   So a valid loop invariant for the second iteration of the loop could be `(x == (1 + 1) + 1) && (y == 0 + 2) && (x >= y)`.\n\n4. After the loop finishes:\n   - The value of `x` is the sum of all the values of `y` added to it during all the iterations of the loop.\n   - The value of `y` is 100000.\n   - The value of `x` is greater than or equal to `y`.\n\n   So a valid loop invariant after the loop finishes could be `(x == 1 + 2 + ... + 99999 + 100000) && (y == 100000) && (x >= y)`.\n\nNote that the loop invariants can be disjunctive, meaning that they can be a combination of multiple conditions connected by an \"OR\" operator. For example, a valid loop invariant before the loop starts could also be `(x == 1 && y == 0) || (x > 1 && y == 0)`."
