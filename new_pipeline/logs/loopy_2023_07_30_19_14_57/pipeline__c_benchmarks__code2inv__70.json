Given a program, you can find loop invariants, which can then be used to verify some property in the program. \nFrama-C is a software verification tool for C programs. The input to Frama-C is a C program file with ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations.\nFor the given program, find the necessary loop invariants of the while loop to help Frama-C verify the post-condition.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. \n- Output loop invariants that are true \n(i) before the loop execution, \n(ii) in every iteration of the loop and \n(iii) after the loop termination, \nsuch that the loop invariants imply the post condition.\n- If a loop invariant is a conjunction, split it into its parts.\n- Output all the loop invariants in one code block. For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **Do not make assumptions about variables that are not initialized.**\n- **Do not use keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops.**\n- **Variables that are not explicitly initialized, could have garbage values. Do not make any assumptions about such values.**\n- To get the value of a variable at the beginning of the loop, use the given pre-conditions."

The first loop invariant `1 <= x` holds because `x` is initialized to 1 and only increases during the loop execution.\n2. The second loop invariant `x <= n + 1` holds because the loop condition is `x <= n`. When the loop terminates, it means that `x > n`, so `x` must be at most `n + 1`.\n3. The third loop invariant `y == n - x + 1` holds because `y` is always updated as `y = n - x` in the loop body. Since `x` starts at 1 and increases by 1 in each iteration, `y` can be expressed as `n - x + 1`.\n\nThese loop invariants hold before the loop execution, during every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. They also imply the post-condition `y < n` when `n > 0`."
