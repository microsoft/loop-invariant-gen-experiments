Loop Invariant:\nA loop invariant is a condition or a set of conditions that remains unchanged before and after each iteration of a loop.

For the first iteration of the loop:\n```\nx == 1 + y * (y - 1) / 2\n```\nThis invariant holds for the first iteration of the loop because the body of the loop only changes the values of `x` and `y` in a way that preserves this equation.\n\n3.

Substituting this value into the equation for the previous invariants, we get `x == 1 + 100000 * (100000 - 1) / 2`, which simplifies to `x == 5000050000`. We also know that `x` is always incremented by `y` in the loop body, so the final value of `x` will be `5000050000`. Finally, we know from the assertion statement that `x` must be greater than or equal to `y`."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on the loop body, we can establish the following loop invariants:\n\n1.
