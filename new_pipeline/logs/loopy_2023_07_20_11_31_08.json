Before the loop starts:\n   - `x >= 1`\n   - `y >= 0`\n   - Sum of the first `y` natural numbers is `y*(y+1)/2`\n\n   Explanation: \n   - `x` is initialized with the value `1`\n   - `y` is initialized with the value `0`\n   - The third condition is based on the fact that the loop will add the values from `0` to `y-1` to `x` in each iteration, so the sum of the first `y` natural numbers should be equal to the current value of `x`. This is true before the loop starts as `y` is `0`, and the sum of the first `0` natural numbers is `0`.\n   \n2. For the first iteration of the loop:\n   - `x >= 1`\n   - `y = 1`\n   - Sum of the first `y` natural numbers is `y*(y+1)/2`\n\n   Explanation:\n   - After the first iteration, `y` is incremented to `1`, and the loop adds `0` to `x`. Hence, the sum of the first `y` natural numbers is still equal to `x`, which is greater than or equal to `y`.\n\n3. For the second iteration of the loop:\n   - `x >= 1`\n   - `y = 2`\n   - Sum of the first `y` natural numbers is `y*(y+1)/2`\n\n   Explanation:\n   - After the second iteration, `y` is incremented to `2`, and the loop adds `1` to `x`. Hence, the sum of the first `y` natural numbers is still equal to `x`, which is greater than or equal to `y`.\n\n4. After the loop finishes:\n   - `x = y*(y+1)/2`\n   - `x >= y`\n   \n   Explanation:\n   - After the loop finishes, the sum of the first `y` natural numbers should be equal to the final value of `x` as it has been continuously updated in each iteration of the loop. This satisfies the first condition of the loop invariant. \n   - Also, the final value of `x` must be greater than or equal to `y`, as the loop adds the values from `0` to `y-1` to `x` in each iteration. Hence, the final value of `x` must be at least equal to the sum of the first `y` natural numbers, which is greater than or equal to `y`. This satisfies the second condition of the loop invariant."

Therefore, `x` is the sum of the first `100000` positive integers, which is `5000050000`. `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, because the loop invariants have been maintained throughout the loop."
