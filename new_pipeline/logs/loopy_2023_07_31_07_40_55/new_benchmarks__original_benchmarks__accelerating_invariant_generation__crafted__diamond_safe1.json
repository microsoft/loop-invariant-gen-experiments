After the loop termination, x will be between 0 and 99.\n\n2. `x % 2 == y % 2` is a loop invariant because it is true before the loop execution (since x is initialized to 0 and we cannot make any assumption about y) and during every iteration of the loop (as x is incremented by either 1 or 2 based on the parity of y). After the loop termination, this invariant implies the post condition `__VERIFIER_assert((x % 2) == (y % 2));`.\n\n3. `(y % 2 == 0) ==> (x % 2 == 0)` is a loop invariant because if y is even, then x will always be incremented by 2 (which is also even).

The first loop invariant ensures that x is always between 0 and 99.\n2. The second loop invariant states that x is always equal to or smaller than y + 1. This is true because x is incremented by either 1 or 2, while y remains unchanged.\n3. The third loop invariant states that if x and y have the same parity (even or odd), then x is less than or equal to y. This captures the relationship between x and y when y is even.\n4. The fourth loop invariant states that if x and y have different parity, then x is equal to y + 1. This captures the relationship between x and y when y is odd.\n\nThese loop invariants capture the relationship between x and y throughout the loop, as well as the bounds on their values.
