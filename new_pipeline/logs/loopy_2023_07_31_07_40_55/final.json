Before the loop execution, both `x` and `y` are initialized to 0.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, `x` is always incremented by 1.\n3. The value of `y` is always equal to the number of increments minus the number of decrements in previous iterations.\n4. After the loop termination, `y` must be less than 0.\n\nTaking all this into account, we can create the following loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant y >= -1;\n    loop invariant \\forall integer i; 0 <= i < x ==> (i <= N) || (i >= N + 1);\n*/\n```\n\nThese loop invariants ensure that:\n\n1. `x` is always non-negative.\n2. `y` is always greater than or equal to -1.\n3. For all integers `i` in the range of `[0, x)`, either `i` is less than or equal to `N`, or `i` is greater than or equal to `N + 1`."

Given a program, you can find loop invariants, which can then be used to verify some property in the program. \nFrama-C is a software verification tool for C programs. The input to Frama-C is a C program file with ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations.\nFor the given program, find the necessary loop invariants of the while loop to help Frama-C verify the post-condition.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. \n- Output loop invariants that are true \n(i) before the loop execution, \n(ii) in every iteration of the loop and \n(iii) after the loop termination, \nsuch that the loop invariants imply the post condition.\n- If a loop invariant is a conjunction, split it into its parts.\n- Output all the loop invariants in one code block. For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values. Do not use variables that have garbage values.**\n- **Do not use keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops.**\n- **Variables that are not explicitly initialized, could have garbage values. Do not make any assumptions about such values.**\n- **Do not use the \\at(x, Pre) notation for any variable x.**\n- **Do not use non-deterministic function calls.**\n"

In every iteration, x is incremented by either 1 (if y is odd) or 2 (if y is even), which maintains the same parity relationship between x and y.

This is true before the loop execution (as x is initialized to 0), during every iteration (as x is incremented or decremented by 2, which preserves the parity), and after the loop termination (which is required by the post-condition).\n- The third loop invariant states that if y % 2 is equal to 0, then x % 4 is equal to 0. This invariant takes care of the conditional nature of the code by using implication. It is true before the loop execution (as x is initialized to 0), during every iteration (as the parity of x is preserved depending on the value of y % 2), and after the loop termination (which is required by the post-condition).\n- The fourth loop invariant states that if y % 2 is not equal to 0, then x % 4 is equal to 2.
