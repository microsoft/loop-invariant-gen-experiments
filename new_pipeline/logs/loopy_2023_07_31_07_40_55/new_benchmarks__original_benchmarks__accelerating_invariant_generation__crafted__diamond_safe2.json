This is true before the loop execution (as x is initialized to 0), during every iteration (as x is incremented or decremented by 2, which preserves the parity), and after the loop termination (which is required by the post-condition).\n- The third loop invariant states that if y % 2 is equal to 0, then x % 4 is equal to 0. This invariant takes care of the conditional nature of the code by using implication. It is true before the loop execution (as x is initialized to 0), during every iteration (as the parity of x is preserved depending on the value of y % 2), and after the loop termination (which is required by the post-condition).\n- The fourth loop invariant states that if y % 2 is not equal to 0, then x % 4 is equal to 2. This invariant also uses implication to handle the conditional nature of the code. It is true before the loop execution (as x is initialized to 0), during every iteration (as the parity of x is preserved depending on the value of y % 2), and after the loop termination (which is required by the post-condition)."
