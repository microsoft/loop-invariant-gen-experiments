In every iteration of the loop, x and y can only increase by 1 or 100 (for x) and 1 or 100 (for y). So, x and y remain non-negative.\n3. Initially, y = 100 * x (both are 0). In every iteration, if x is incremented by 1, y is incremented by 100. If x is incremented by 1 in the second case (when x >= 4), y is also incremented by 1. Thus, y >= 100 * x holds in every iteration.\n4. If x >= 4, y is at least 4 * 100 = 400, which is greater than 2, so the post-condition (x >= 4 && y <= 2) can never be satisfied.\n5. For every integer k such that 4 <= k <= x, y >= 100 * k. This invariant holds because, when x >= 4, y is incremented by 1 along with x in the second case, and otherwise, y is incremented by 100 when x is incremented by 1.\n\nThese loop invariants help Frama-C to verify the post-condition by capturing the relation between x and y and the conditions in which they can be incremented."
