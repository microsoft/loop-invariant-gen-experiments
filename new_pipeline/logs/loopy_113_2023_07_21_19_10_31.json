If this condition is true, it asserts that `sn` must be equal to -1.\n\n```c\nif ( (sn != x) )\n  assert( (sn == -1) );\n```\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the post-condition does not make sense in this context. Since `sn` and `x` are always incremented together inside the loop, they should be equal when the loop terminates. Therefore, the condition `(sn != x)` should never be true, making the assertion irrelevant."
