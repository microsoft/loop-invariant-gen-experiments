The sum of the integers from 1 to 0 is 0 + 1 = 1, which confirms `x` is the sum of integers from 1 to `y`.\n- During every iteration of the loop: If `x` is the sum of integers from 1 to `y` before an iteration, then in the next iteration, the new value of `x` is `x = x + y` and `y = y + 1`. Since `x` is the sum of integers from 1 to `y`, adding `y` to the current value of `x` will make it the sum of integers from 1 to the new value of `y` (which is `y + 1`). This maintains the loop invariant.\n- After the loop finishes: When the loop terminates, `y` is equal to 100,000. The value of `x` will be the sum of integers from 1 to `y`.\n\nLoop Invariant 2: The value of `y` is always non-negative and less than or equal to 100,000.\n- Before the loop starts: `y = 0`, which is non-negative and less than or equal to 100,000.\n- During every iteration of the loop: In each iteration, `y` is incremented by 1 (`y = y + 1`). Since the loop condition is `y < 100000`, the value of `y` will always be non-negative and less than or equal to 100,000.\n- After the loop finishes: When the loop terminates, the value of `y` is 100,000, which is non-negative and less than or equal to 100,000.\n\nThese two loop invariants are valid at all the specified points in the code."

Initially, when `y` is 0, the sum is 0, and `x` is 1 (which still holds true as 0 * 1 / 2 = 0). During each iteration, we add `y` to `x`, effectively adding the sum of the numbers up to the current value of `y`. When the loop finishes, this invariant still holds true, as it represents the sum of all numbers up to the final value of `y`.\n\n1. Before the loop starts: `x = 1`, `y = 0`, so `x == (y * (y + 1)) / 2`, which is `1 == (0 * (0 + 1)) / 2`, and this holds true.\n2. During every iteration of the loop: After each iteration, `y` is incremented, and `x` is updated with the sum of all numbers from 1 to the new `y`. So, at each step, the invariant `x == (y * (y + 1)) / 2` holds true.\n3. After the loop finishes: Since the loop invariant holds true for each iteration, it also holds true after the loop finishes.\n\nThese invariants hold true before the loop starts, during every iteration of the loop, and after the loop finishes, satisfying the conditions for a correct loop invariant."
