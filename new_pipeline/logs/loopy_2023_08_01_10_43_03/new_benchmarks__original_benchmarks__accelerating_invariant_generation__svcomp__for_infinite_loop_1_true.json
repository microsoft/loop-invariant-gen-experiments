Based on your instructions, let's re-analyze the given C program and provide the loop invariants.\n\nPre-conditions and variable assignments:\n- `int i=0, x=0, y=0;`\n- `int n=__VERIFIER_nondet_int();`\n- `__VERIFIER_assume(n>0);`\n\nLoop body and loop condition:\n- The loop is a `for` loop with condition `1`, which means it is an infinite loop.\n\nLoop invariants:\n1. The invariant `x == 0` holds before the loop execution (since `x` is initialized to `0`).\n2. The invariant `x == 0` holds in every iteration of the loop (since `x` is never modified within the loop).\n3. The invariant `x == 0` holds after the loop termination (although this loop never terminates due to the infinite loop condition).\n4. The invariant `i >= 0` holds in every iteration of the loop (since `i` is initialized to `0` and only increases).\n5. The invariant `n > 0 ==> x == 0` holds in every iteration of the loop (since `x` is never modified within the loop).\n\nPutting these invariants together, we get:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x == 0;\n    loop invariant i >= 0;\n    loop invariant n > 0 ==> x == 0;\n*/\n```"
