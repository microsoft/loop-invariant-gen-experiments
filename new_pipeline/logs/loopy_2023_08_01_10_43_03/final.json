Given a program, you can find loop invariants, which can then be used to verify some property in the program. \nFrama-C is a software verification tool for C programs. The input to Frama-C is a C program file with ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations.\nFor the given program, find the necessary loop invariants of the while loop to help Frama-C verify the post-condition.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. \n- Output loop invariants that are true \n(i) before the loop execution, \n(ii) in every iteration of the loop and \n(iii) after the loop termination, \nsuch that the loop invariants imply the post condition.\n- If a loop invariant is a conjunction, split it into its parts.\n- Output all the loop invariants in one code block. For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values. Do not use variables that have garbage values.**\n- **Do not use keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops.**\n- **Variables that are not explicitly initialized, could have garbage values. Do not make any assumptions about such values.**\n- **Do not use the \\at(x, Pre) notation for any variable x.**\n- **Do not use non-deterministic function calls.**\n"

Given a program, you can find loop invariants, which can then be used to verify some property in the program. \nFrama-C is a software verification tool for C programs. The input to Frama-C is a C program file with ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations.\nFor the given program, find the necessary loop invariants of the while loop to help Frama-C verify the post-condition.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. \n- Output loop invariants that are true \n(i) before the loop execution, \n(ii) in every iteration of the loop and \n(iii) after the loop termination, \nsuch that the loop invariants imply the post condition.\n- If a loop invariant is a conjunction, split it into its parts.\n- Output all the loop invariants in one code block. For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values. Do not use variables that have garbage values.**\n- **Do not use keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops.**\n- **Variables that are not explicitly initialized, could have garbage values.

Since `x` is initialized to an even value (10) and is incremented by an even value (2) in each iteration, it remains even throughout the loop. This invariant is true before the loop execution, in every iteration, and after the loop termination.\n\n2. `x >= 10`: This invariant ensures that `x` remains greater than or equal to 10 throughout the loop. Since the loop condition is `x >= 10`, this invariant is true before the loop execution, in every iteration, and after the loop termination, when the loop condition becomes false.\n\n3. `x <= UINT_MAX`: This invariant bounds the maximum value that `x` can take, which is `UINT_MAX` (maximum unsigned integer value). This invariant is true before the loop execution, in every iteration, and after the loop termination.\n\nIn this case, using implications is not necessary because there are no conditional statements or non-deterministic variables inside the loop. The loop invariants provided are sufficient to help Frama-C verify the post-condition, which is `x % 2`."

For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values.

Given a program, you can find loop invariants, which can then be used to verify some property in the program. \nFrama-C is a software verification tool for C programs. The input to Frama-C is a C program file with ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations.\nFor the given program, find the necessary loop invariants of the while loop to help Frama-C verify the post-condition.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. \n- Output loop invariants that are true \n(i) before the loop execution, \n(ii) in every iteration of the loop and \n(iii) after the loop termination, \nsuch that the loop invariants imply the post condition.\n- If a loop invariant is a conjunction, split it into its parts.\n- Output all the loop invariants in one code block. For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values. Do not use variables that have garbage values.**\n- **Do not use keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops.**\n- **Variables that are not explicitly initialized, could have garbage values. Do not make any assumptions about such values.**\n- **Do not use the \\at(x, Pre) notation for any variable x.**\n- **Do not use non-deterministic function calls.**\n"

For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values.

It is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination (which never occurs in this case).\n\n2. `0 <= i`: This invariant is true before the loop execution since `i` is initialized to 0. In every iteration of the loop, `i` is incremented by 1, so it remains non-negative. The loop is an infinite loop and never terminates, so `i` will always be non-negative.\n\n3. `i <= n`: This invariant is true before the loop execution since both `i` and `n` are initialized to 0, and `n` is then assigned a non-deterministic positive integer value. In every iteration of the loop, `i` is incremented by 1, but it will never exceed `n` since the loop is infinite and the value of `n` remains unchanged during the loop execution. The loop never terminates, so the invariant `i <= n` remains true throughout the loop execution.\n\n4. `0 <= n`: This invariant is true before the loop execution due to the `__VERIFIER_assume(n > 0)` statement, which ensures that `n` is greater than 0. The value of `n` remains unchanged during the loop execution and the loop never terminates, so the invariant `0 <= n` remains true throughout the loop execution.\n\nThe assertion `__VERIFIER_assert(x != 0)` is still unreachable, as the loop never terminates."

This post-condition will never be reached due to the infinite loop.\n\nHere is the revised loop invariant for the property checked inside the loop, taking into account the guard condition, bounds, and relations:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i >= 0;\n    loop invariant x == 0;\n    loop invariant y == 0;\n    loop invariant (i > 0) ==> (x == 0);\n*/\n```\n\nIn this case, `i` is non-negative and increases indefinitely.

They are true before the loop execution as `j = 0`, and there are no elements before `j`.\n2. They are true in every iteration of the loop because `j` is incremented by 1 and the loop continues if `a[j] != q`.\n3.
