For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values.

If x < 10, sn is incremented by a (2). So, sn will be equal to x*a. If x >= 10, sn will not be incremented, and since it was 0 before, it will remain 0.

However, since this is an infinite loop, we only need to consider the invariants that hold before the loop and in every iteration of the loop. \n\nTo help Frama-C verify the post-condition, we need to find the loop invariants related to sn and x. From the loop body, we can see that sn is updated when x < 10, and x is always incremented by 1. We need to find a relationship between sn and x that holds throughout the loop execution.\n\nHere are the loop invariants that we can derive from the loop:\n\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant 0 <= x;\n  loop invariant 0 <= sn;\n  loop invariant x <= 10 || sn == 10 * a;\n  loop invariant x < 10 ==> sn == x * a;\n*/\n```\n\nThese loop invariants express the following properties:\n1. x is always non-negative.\n2. sn is always non-negative.\n3. If x > 10, then sn must be equal to 10 * a.\n4. If x is less than 10, then sn must be equal to x * a.\n\nThese loop invariants hold true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and they help Frama-C verify the post-condition specified in the __VERIFIER_assert function call."
