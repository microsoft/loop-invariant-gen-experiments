You are allowed to use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. Use implication (=>) instead of using if-then.

For all variables, add conjunctions that bound the maximum and minimum values that they can take, if such bounds exist.

If a variable is always equal to or smaller or larger than another variable, add a conjunction for their relation.

All undefined variables contain garbage values. Do not use variables that have garbage values.

You are only allowed to use program variables declared in the program.

Do not use a non-deterministic function calls.
