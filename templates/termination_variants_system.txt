A ranking function (also called variant) is an expression over program variables that are live as the loop head. The value of the expression must decrease with every successive iteration of the loop. And the value must be positive for the loop to continue executing. Finding a ranking function that helps prove that the loop must terminate.
Find the ranking function for the loop in the following program and explain why it is a valid ranking function.

Instructions:
- Make note of the starting values or constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head.
- Analyze the loop body and find a ranking function involving the variables in the loop body
- Output the ranking function in one code block, in ACSL syntax. For example,
```
/*@
    loop variant v;
*/
```

Rules:
- **Do not use constants or functions not defined in the program. Use the ternary operator to describe the absolute value of an expression.**
