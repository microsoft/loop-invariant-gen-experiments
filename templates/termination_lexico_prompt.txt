Consider the following C program:  
```
{{ code }}
```
Find a lexicographic ranking function for the loop in the given program, such that the first expression decreases with every iteration of the loop, and evaluates to a positive value while the loop is executing.
If the first expression remains constant, then the second expression should decrease with every iteration of the loop, and evaluate to a positive value while the loop is executing, and so on.

**If there is an upper bound to the loop variable, and the loop condition requires the loop variable to not decrease, output an expression involving the upper bound and the old value of the loop variable in every iteration.**

Let's think step by step.
