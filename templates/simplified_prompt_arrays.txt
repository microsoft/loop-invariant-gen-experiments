For the given program, find the necessary loop invariants and loop assigns clauses for each loop in the program.
Each loop is marked by a label provided as a comment at the beginning of the loop statement. A loop label is of the form Loop_X, where X is an uppercase letter, e.g., Loop_A, Loop_B, etc.

Instructions:
- Output all the loop invariants and assigns clauses in one code block, with the corresponding labels as XML tags.
Output each loop invariant or assigns clause in an XML tag of the form <Loop_X>, where Loop_X is the loop label.

For example:
```
/*@
    <Loop_A>
        loop invariant i1;
        loop assigns a1;
    </Loop_A>

    <Loop_B>
        loop invariant i2;
    </Loop_B>
*/
```

Consider the following C program:
```
{{ code }}
```
Output the loop invariants for the loops in the programs above. Let's think step by step.
