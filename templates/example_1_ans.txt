First, we need to find the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program. 
From the program, we can see that x is assigned -50 and y is assigned unknown_int().

Next, we need to analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. From the program, we can see that the loop condition is x < 0.
In each iteration of the loop, x is assigned x + y and y is assigned y + 1. The loop terminates when x >= 0.

Next, we need to make a note of the post-condition. From the program, we can see that the post-condition is y > 0.

Given the above information, we can use the following loop invariants:
```
/*@ 
    loop invariant x < 0 || y > 0;
*/
```
