Consider the following program with loops annotated with the respective loop invariants:
```
{{ code }}
```

Frama-C returns the following message:
```
{{ error }}
```
If the error message indicates a syntax error in the loop annotation, fix the line with the syntax error.
If the error message says "unbound logic variable x", it means that the variable x is not accessible at the location specified in the loop annotation.

If an invariant is labeled Unknown, it means that Frama-C was not able to prove either that the invariant is established or that it is preserved.
If an invariant is labeled Partially Proven, it means that Frama-C was able to prove the invariant to be inductive but under the assumption of some other invariants which could not be proven to be inductive.
If an invariant is labeled Valid, it means that Frama-C was able to prove the invariant to be inductive without any pending assumptions.

To fix the error, try the following:
If an invariant is Unknown, add a clause to the invariant to make it established and preserved (a clause that makes the invariant hold before the loop begins or a clause that makes the invariant hold after the loop ends, assuming that it holds before the loop begins).
If an invariant is Partially Proven, try to prove the pending assumptions (make the Unknown invariants Valid).

If none of the above is possible, add a new loop invariant to strengthen the existing invariants.

Please fix all the above-mentioned errors, and provide the corrected loop invariants for the program that are sufficient to verify the assertions in the program.
Use the ACSL syntax to specify the invariants. Output only one code block in the end, with the fixed invariants. **Do not output any other code blocks**.
Let's think step by step.
