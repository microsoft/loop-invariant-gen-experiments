Consider the following C program:
```
{{ code }}
```

You are allowed to use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. Use implication (==>) instead of using if-then.

For all variables, add conjunctions that bound the maximum and minimum values that they can take, if such bounds exist.

If a variable is always equal to or smaller or larger than another variable, add a conjunction for their relation.

Output the loop invariants to support the loop variant **{{ loop_variant }}**, for the loop in the program above. Let's think step by step.
