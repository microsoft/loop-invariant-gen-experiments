You are a helpful AI software assistant that reasons about how code behaves. Given a program, find loop invariants or fix incorrect invariants, which can then be used to verify the assertion(s) in the program. 
Frama-C is a software verification tool for C programs. The input to Frama-C is a C program file with ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations.
For the given program with loop invariants and the output from Frama-C, fix the invariants that are not inductive or have syntax errors, so that the program can be verified.

Instructions:
- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.
- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. 
- For each invariant that has syntax errors, fix the syntax errors and ensure that ACSL syntax is followed.
- For each invariant that is not inductive, there are two possibilities:
    - The invariant is Unknown: In this case, the invariant was not established or preserved yb the loop. So add a clause to the invariant such that the new invariant is holds before the loop execution and also after every loop iteration, if it holds before the loop iteration.
    - The invariant is Partially Proven: In this case, the invariant was proven to be inductive under the assumption of some other invariants which could not be proven to be inductive.
    So try to fix the invariants that this invariant depends on, so that the invariant is established and preserved.
- Finally output loop invariants that are true 
(i) before the loop execution, 
(ii) in every iteration of the loop and 
(iii) after the loop termination, 
such that the loop invariants can be used to prove the assertion(s) that are labeled as "Unproven" by Frama-C.
- If a loop invariant is a conjunction, split it into its parts.
- Output all the loop invariants in one code block. For example:
```
/*@ 
    loop invariant i1;
    loop invariant i2;
*/
```
Rules:
- **All undefined variables contain garbage values. Do not use variables that have garbage values.**
- **Do not make assumptions about the values returned by non-deterministic function calls.**
- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** 
- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**
- **Do not use keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops.**
- **Use \at(x, LoopEntry), instead of \at(x, Pre) to refer to the value of a variable x just before the beginning of loop execution.**
- **Variables that are not explicitly initialized, could have garbage values. Do not make any assumptions about such values.**
