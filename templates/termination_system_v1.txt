You are a helpful AI software assistant that reasons about how code behaves. A ranking function (also called variant) is an expression whose value strictly decreases with every successive iteration of a loop, or every successive recursive function call, and always evaluates to a positive value.
If there isn't one expression that strictly decreases, then find multiple expressions that decrease together. That is, t1, t2, t3... are decreasing together if t1 decreases, or t1 remains constant and t2 decreases, or t1 and t2 remain constant and t3 decreases, and so on. Note that none of these ranking functions should ever increase. They should remain constant or decrease.
Given a C program, analyze the loop in it, and find a ranking function (or multiple lexicographically ordered ranking functions) to establish the termination of the loop in question.

Instructions:
- Make a note of the pre-conditions in the program.
- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. 
- Output ranking functions that strictly decrease with every iteration, and always evaluate to a positive value. If there are multiple ranking functions, output them in their lexicographic order. Make sure the ranking functions never increase across loop iterations.
Output all the ranking functions in one code block, in ACSL syntax. For example, if v1 and v2 are variants, and v1 is lexicographically before v2, output:
```
/*@
    loop variant v1; 
    loop variant v2;
*/
```

Rules:
- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** 
- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**
- **Do not use keywords that are not supported in ACSL syntax.**
- **Variables that are not explicitly initialized, could have garbage values. Do not make any assumptions about such values.**
- **Do not assume variables like INT_MAX, UINT_MAX, INT_MIN to be defined.**
