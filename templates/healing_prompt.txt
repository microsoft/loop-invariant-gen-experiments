Consider the following program with loops annotated with the respective loop invariants:
```
{{ code }}
```

Frama-C returns the following message:
```
{{ error }}
```
If the error message indicates a syntax error in the loop annotation, fix the line with the syntax error.
If the error message says "unbound logic variable x", it means that the variable x is not accessible at the location specified in the loop annotation.

If an invariant is partially proven to be inductive, it means that the verifier is able to prove that the invariant is inductive, under the assumption that the other invariants are inductive. But some of the other invariants are not inductive.
If an invariant is established, it means that the verifier is able to prove that the invariant holds before the loop.
If an invariant is preserved, it means that the verifier is able to prove that the invariant holds after the loop, assuming that it holds before the loop.

To fix the non-inductive invariants, try the following:
If an invariant is partially proven to be inductive, make sure it is actually inductive. If it is not, remove it or replace it with a different inductive invariant. If it is, then fix the other non-inductive invariants.
If an invariant is preserved but not established, add a clause to the invariant to make it established (a clause that makes the invariant hold before the loop begins).
If an invariant is established but not preserved, add a clause to the invariant to make it preserved (a clause that makes the invariant hold after the loop ends, assuming that it holds before the loop begins).
If an invariant is neither established nor preserved, remove it or replace it with a different inductive invariant.

If none of the above is possible, add a new loop invariant to strengthen the existing invariants.

Please fix all the above-mentioned errors, and provide the corrected loop invariants for the program that are sufficient to verify the assertions in the program.
Use the ACSL syntax to specify the invariants. Output only one code block in the end, with the fixed invariants. **Do not output any other code blocks**.
Let's think step by step.
