Consider the following program with loops annotated with the respective loop invariants:
```
{{ code }}
```

Frama-C returns the following message:
```
{{ error }}
```
If the error message indicates a syntax error in the loop annotation, fix the line with the syntax error.
If the error message says "unbound logic variable x", it means that the variable x is not accessible at the location specified in the loop annotation.

If an invariant is established, it means that the verifier is able to prove that the invariant holds before the loop.
If an invariant is preserved, it means that the verifier is able to prove that the invariant holds after the loop, assuming that it holds before the loop.

To fix the error, try the following:
If there is a syntax error, fix the syntax error.
If an invariant is preserved but not established, add a clause to the invariant to make it established (a clause that makes the invariant hold before the loop begins).
If an invariant is established but not preserved, add a clause to the invariant to make it preserved (a clause that makes the invariant hold after the loop ends, assuming that it holds before the loop begins).
If an invariant is neither established nor preserved, remove it or replace it with a different inductive invariant.

If none of the above is possible, add a new loop invariant to strengthen the existing invariants.

Please fix all the above-mentioned errors, and provide the corrected loop invariants for the program that is sufficient to verify the post-condition in the program.
Use the ACSL syntax to specify the invariants. Output all the fixed invariants in one final code block.
Let's think step by step.
