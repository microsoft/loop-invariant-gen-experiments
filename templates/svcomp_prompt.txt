Consider the following C program:
```
{{ code }}
```

Use the ACSL syntax to specify the loop invariants for each of the loops in the program, and function contracts for the functions in the program. 
The function contracts must include the pre- and post-conditions, and the loop invariants must be specified for each loop in the program. 
The loop invariants must be specified using the "loop invariant" annotation and must end with a semi-colon.
The function contracts must be specified using the "requires" and "ensures" clauses and must end with semi-colons.
All the annotations must be provided along with the label of the loop or function, in XML format.

Consider all uninitialized variables contain garbage values. Ensure that the loop invariants and function contracts are specified in such a way that all the assertions in the program are verified successfully.
Let's think step by step.
