First, we need to find the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program. 
From the program, we can see that the pre-conditions are leader_len > 0, bufsize > 0, ielen > 0, bufsize >= leader_len, bufsize_0 = bufsize, p = leader_len, and bufsize >= 2 * ielen.

Next, we need to analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. From the program, we can see that the loop condition is i < ielen && bufsize > 2.
In each iteration of the loop, we can see that the following assignments are made: p += 2.

Next, we need to make a note of the assertions. From the program, we can see that the assertions are 0 <= p and p + 1 < bufsize_0.

Given the above information, we can use the following loop invariants:
```
  /*@
    loop invariant 1 <= p;
    loop invariant p + 2 * ielen <= 2 * i + bufsize_0; 
    loop invariant 1 <= leader_len;  
  */
```
