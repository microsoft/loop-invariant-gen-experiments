Write down the precondition and postcondition (also referred to as requires and ensures, respectively) for the <function name> procedure in the program below. The precondition and postcondition should be specified in the ACSL syntax used by Frama-C and should be such that the "assert(\false)" annotation is not reachable.
 
You do not need to ensure functional correctness; only ensure that the "assert(\false)" is not reachable. Also, you are not allowed to use function calls in the "ensures" and "requires" clauses.
