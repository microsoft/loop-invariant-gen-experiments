Consider the following C program:  
```
{{ code }}
```

Find a multi-phase ranking function such that, the first expression decreases with successive iterations of the loop. When the first expression becomes non-positive, the second expression decreases with successive iterations of the loop. This goes on until the last expression becomes non-positive and the loop terminates.

For the first expression in the ranking function, always choose an expression that immediately decreases with every iteration of the loop. 
For the second expression, find an expression that decreases once the first expression becomes zero or negative, and so on.

Use non-deterministically updated variables only if such variables are definitely decreasing with every iteration of the loop at some point.

Adding a non-positive expression to a positive expression could result in a non-positive expression. 

Find the ranking function for the loop in the given program. Let's think step by step.
