Great. Let's think step by step. Is it a syntax error or an error with the invariant? How can we fix these invariants? Only changing the loop invariants written as 'invariant ...' is allowed. The following hints might help:

If it is an invariant error:
1. If the invariant cannot be proved on loop entry, could you alter the invariant to conditionally hold only after loop entry by adding an implies clause? Or, could you alter the invariant to hold on loop entry as well?
2. If the invariant could not be proven to be maintained, could you make the invariant stronger or fix it in another way?
3. If the assertion i.e. the postcondition could not be proved, could you add more loop invariants or make the existing invariants stronger?
4. Would expression rewriting for the invariants help? Eg. converting division to multiplication

If it is a syntax error:
- '/' is not a valid division operator. Replace the '/' operator with 'div'
- '%' is not a valid modulus operator. Replace the '%' operator with 'mod'
- '=' is not a valid equality operator. Replace the '=' operator with '=='
- Composing inequality operators is not allowed. Break it up into the constituent inequalities. Eg. 0 <= x <= 1 is not allowed. Instead, (0 <= x) && (x <= 1) is allowed

Keep in mind:
1. Changing the semantics of the original program is not allowed
2. You are allowed to attempt fixes beyond the given hints to the invariants
3. Disjunctive invariants are allowed
4. You are allowed to remove invariants that are incorrect
