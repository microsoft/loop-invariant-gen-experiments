The benchmarks in this directory were submitted by Matt Lewis.
They were taken from the regression tests for under-approximate
loop acceleration in CBMC.

Tasks ending in _abstracted.* contain versions of these tasks
where a loop has been overaproximated using simple abstraction
techniques, as described in:
"A Unifying Approach for Control-Flow-Based Loop Abstraction" (SEFM 2022)
