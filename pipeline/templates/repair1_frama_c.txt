Frama-C is a software verification tool that given a program and a specification, attempts to prove that the program satisfies the specification. Frama-C takes input programs written in C and specifications written in ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language).

You are given the following C code with incorrect or insufficient loop invariants in ACSL format along with the error returned by the Frama-C checker upon attempted verification. The objective is to fix or complete the invariants so that Frama-C can successfully verify the given code.

Code:
```
{{ code }}
```
Do not modify the code the above block in any way. You can only modify the invariants in the annotations.

Error message from Frama-C:
```
{{ error }}
```

Let's think step by step. First, note that the error message indicates that the following invariants are wrong or insufficient.

```
{{ incorrect_invariants }}
```

Is the error message indicating a syntax error? If it is a syntax error, note that the error message might not be accurate and it is best to examine the lines before and after the indicated lines as well.

If it is not a syntax error, what is the error message indicating about the incorrect invariants?
