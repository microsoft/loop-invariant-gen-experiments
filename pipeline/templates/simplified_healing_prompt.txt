Consider the following program with loop invariants annotated with the respective loop(s):
```
{{ code }}
```

The verifier returns the following message.
```
{{ error }}
```
We performed further analysis on the above set of invariants. We found that {{ analysis }}
Provide the corrected loop invariants for the program that is sufficient to verify the program.
Use the ACSL syntax to specify the invariants.
