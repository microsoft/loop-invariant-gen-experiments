Recall what is a loop invariant to prove the correctness of a program.

 

Consider the following program with loop invariants annotated with the respective loop(s).

'''

{{ instrumented_program }}

'''

 

The verifier returns the following message.

"""

{{ verifier_message }}

"""

 

We performed further analysis on the above set of invariants. We found that {{ analysis }}

 

Provide the corrected loop invariants for the program that is sufficient to verify the program.

 

Use the ACSL syntax to specify the invariants.
