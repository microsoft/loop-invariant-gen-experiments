Consider the following program with loop invariants annotated with the respective loop(s):
```
{{ code }}
```

The verifier returns the following message.
```
{{ error }}
```
If an invariant is established, it means that the verifier was able to prove that the invariant holds before the loop.
If an invariant is preserved, it means that the verifier was able to prove that the invariant holds after the loop, assuming that it holds before the loop.

To fix the error, try the following:
If an invariant is established but not preserved, add a clause to the invariant that captures the change in the loop body.
If an invariant is neither established nor preserved, consider removing it, or replacing it with a different inductive invariant.

There could be errors in the loop annotation(s), other than the ones mentioned in the above error message from the verifier.
Please fix all the above-mentioned errors, and provide the corrected loop invariants for the program that is sufficient to verify the post-condition in the program.
Use the ACSL syntax to specify the invariants.
