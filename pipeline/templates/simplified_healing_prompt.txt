Consider the following program with loop invariants annotated with the respective loop(s):
```
{{ code }}
```

The verifier returns the following message.
```
{{ error }}
```
If an invariant is marked as Unknown, it means that the verifier could not prove it to be inductive.
If an invariant is marked as Partially Proven, it means that the verifier was depending on another assertion/loop invariant to prove its inductiveness.
If an invariant is marked as Valid, it means that the verifier was able to prove it to be inductive.
There could be errors in the loop annotation(s), other than the ones mentioned in the above error message from the verifier.
Please fix all the errors, and provide the corrected loop invariants for the program that is sufficient to verify the post-condition in the program.
Use the ACSL syntax to specify the invariants.
