Consider what is a loop invariant to prove the correctness of a program.

Find the loop invariant for all the loops in the following program. Each loop is marked by a label provided as a comment at the respective loop statement. The markers are the word "Loop" followed by uppercase letters, for example, "LoopA", LoopB" etc.

```
{{ code }}
```

Use the ACSL syntax to specify the invariants. For each loop, the respective invariants must be marked by the loop label, separated by a colon.

For example, "LoopA: loop invariant i1".
Consider all uninitialized variables contain garbage values. Ensure that the invariant implies the assertion condition.
{{ nudges }}
Each conjunct must be provided with a separate "loop invariant" annotation and must end with a semi-colon.
