Termination of a loop is established using a decreasing variant, also known as a ranking function. 
The decreasing variant may also need supporting inductive invariants for the proof of termination to be valid.
Provide the decreasing variant that proves the termination of the loop along with any supporting invariants that may be necessary.
Output all the loop invariants and variants in one code block. For example:
```
/*@ 
    loop invariant i1;
    loop invariant i2;
    loop variant v1;
*/
```
