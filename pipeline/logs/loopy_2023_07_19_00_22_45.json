Loop Invariant:\nA loop invariant is a condition or a set of conditions that remains unchanged before and after each iteration of a loop.

Conditions for a Loop Invariant:\nA correct loop invariant in a program should satisfy three conditions:\n\n- Initialization: It must be true prior to the first iteration of the loop.\n- Maintenance: If it's true before an iteration of the loop, it remains true before the next iteration.\n- Termination: When the loop terminates, the invariant gives us a useful property that helps show that the algorithm is correct."}], [{"role": "user", "content": "\n\nGreat.
