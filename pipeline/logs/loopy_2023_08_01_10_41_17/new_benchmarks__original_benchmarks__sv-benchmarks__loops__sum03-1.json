Add a conjunction for the relation between variables if one is always equal to or smaller or larger than another variable.\nThere is no such relation between variables in this program.\n\n4.

Use an implication to make the invariant trivially true at the beginning or end of the loop for non-deterministic variables.\n- As `sn` is initialized to 0 and `x` is initialized to 0, and both are updated deterministically within the loop, there is no need for additional implications for these variables.\n\nTaking all these guidelines into account, the updated loop invariants are:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= x;\n    loop invariant x <= 10;\n    loop invariant (x < 10)  ==> (sn == x * a);\n    loop invariant (x >= 10) ==> (sn == 10 * a);\n*/\n```\n\nIn this version, we have added the upper bound of `x` and used implications for both the guard condition `x < 10` and its negation `x >= 10`."
