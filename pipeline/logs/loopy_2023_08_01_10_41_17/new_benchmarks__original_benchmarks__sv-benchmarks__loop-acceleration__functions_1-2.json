Before the loop execution, x is initialized to 0, which satisfies the invariant. The function `f(x)` adds 2 to x, which preserves the evenness of x in every iteration. After the loop termination, this invariant is still true.\n2. `x <= 0x0fffffff`: Before the loop execution, x is initialized to 0, which satisfies the invariant. In every iteration, x is increased by 2. Since the loop condition is `x < 0x0fffffff`, this invariant holds after every iteration. After the loop termination, x must be greater than or equal to 0x0fffffff, so the invariant still holds.\n\nThe `__VERIFIER_assert(x % 2)` assertion is guarded by the loop condition, so the loop invariants above are sufficient to imply the post-condition."

After the loop termination, `x` is either equal to or greater than `0x0fffffff`.\n3. `x >= 0`: Since `x` is initialized to 0 and always updated by a non-negative value (z + 2), `x` remains non-negative throughout the loop execution.\n4. `(x >= 0x0fffffff) ==> (x % 2 == 1)`: If `x` is greater than or equal to `0x0fffffff` (i.e., loop termination condition), it implies that `x % 2` is equal to 1.

This is true before the loop (since x is initialized to 0), during the loop (since x is always incremented by 2), and after the loop (since the loop terminates when x is no longer less than 0x0fffffff).\n- The second loop invariant states that x is always an even number (x % 2 == 0). This is true before the loop (since x is initialized to 0), during the loop (since x is always incremented by 2, which maintains its evenness), and after the loop (since the loop terminates when x is no longer less than 0x0fffffff, and x was last updated with an even value).\n- The third loop invariant is an implication. It states that if x is less than 0x0fffffff, then the value of x + 2 is also less than or equal to 0x0fffffff. This helps us reason about the bounds of x during the loop execution. Since x is incremented by 2 in each iteration, this invariant ensures that x will not overflow and will remain within the valid range during the loop execution."
