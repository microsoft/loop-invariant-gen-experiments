This is true before the loop execution (as j = 0 and k is initialized to some value), during every iteration of the loop (as j is incremented and k is decremented), and after the loop termination.\n\n3. `0 <= j <= n`: This invariant states that j is always between 0 and n (inclusive). This is true before the loop execution (as j is initialized to 0), during every iteration of the loop (as j is incremented), and after the loop termination (as the loop condition is j <= n - 1).\n\n4. `k >= -j`: This invariant states that k is always greater than or equal to the negation of j. This is true before the loop execution (as j is initialized to 0 and k is initialized to some value), during every iteration of the loop (as j is incremented and k is decremented), and after the loop termination.

We don't know the values of `k` and `n` at this point.\n2. There is a condition `if (k >= n && n >= 1)`. If this condition is true, then the rest of the code inside the block executes.\n3. Inside the block, variable `i` is assigned a value from another unknown function `unknown1()`.\n4. The variable `j` is initialized to 0.\n5. The loop starts with the condition `j <= n - 1`. Inside the loop, `j` is incremented by 1 and `k` is decremented by 1.\n6. After the loop, there is a condition `if (j >= n)`.

In that case, the loop invariants should be trivially true.\n2.
