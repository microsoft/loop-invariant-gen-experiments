In every iteration of the loop: \n   - `x` is increasing (`x = x + y`)\n   - `y` is increasing (`y++`)\n3. After the loop termination: `x >= 0`\n\nWe can also note that:\n- `x` is always less than or equal to `y`.\n\nNow, we can write the refined loop invariants using implications and additional conjunctions:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x <= 0;\n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n    loop invariant x <= y;\n    loop invariant (x >= 0) ==> (y > 0);\n    loop variant -x;\n*/\n```\n\nThese invariants should help Frama-C verify the post-condition `y > 0`."
