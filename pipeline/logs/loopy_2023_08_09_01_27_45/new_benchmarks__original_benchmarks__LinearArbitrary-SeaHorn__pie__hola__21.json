If i is 0 (i.e., before the first iteration), k must be 0.\n4. If i is greater than 0, k must be within the range [2000 * i, 4000 * i] (inclusive) because in each iteration, k is incremented by either 2000 or 4000.\n\nThese loop invariants hold before the loop execution, during every iteration, and after the loop termination.
