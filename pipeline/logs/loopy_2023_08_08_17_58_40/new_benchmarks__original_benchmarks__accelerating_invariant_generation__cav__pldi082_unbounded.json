Given a program, you can find loop invariants, which can then be used to verify some property in the program. \nFrama-C is a software verification tool for C programs. The input to Frama-C is a C program file with ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations.\nFor the given program, find the necessary loop invariants of the while loop to help Frama-C verify the post-condition.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. \n- Output loop invariants that are true \n(i) before the loop execution, \n(ii) in every iteration of the loop and \n(iii) after the loop termination, \nsuch that the loop invariants imply the post condition.\n- If a loop invariant is a conjunction, split it into its parts.\n- Output all the loop invariants in one code block. For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values.

The pre-conditions and variable assignments at the beginning of the program are:\n\n```\nint x = 0;\nint y = 0;\nint N;\n```\n\nThe loop condition is `1`, which means it is a non-terminating loop, but it breaks when `y < 0`. The post-condition we are interested in verifying is `y == -1 && x >= 2 * N + 3`.\n\nNow let's find the loop invariants. We need to find invariants that hold (i) before the loop execution, (ii) in every iteration of the loop, and (iii) after the loop termination.\n\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant x >= 0;\n  loop invariant y >= -1;\n  loop invariant x - y <= N + 1;\n  loop invariant (x > N) ==> (y <= 0);\n*/\n```\n\nExplanation of the loop invariants:\n1. `x >= 0`: Before the loop, x is initialized to 0, and during the loop, x is incremented by 1 in each iteration. So, x is always non-negative.\n2. `y >= -1`: Before the loop, y is initialized to 0. During the loop, y is either incremented or decremented by 1. But the loop terminates when y becomes -1. So, y will always be greater than or equal to -1.\n3. `x - y <= N + 1`: Before the loop, x and y are both 0, so x - y is 0, which is less than or equal to N + 1. In each iteration, if x <= N, y is incremented by 1, keeping x - y constant. If x >= N + 1, y is decremented by 1, increasing x - y by 2. So, x - y can never exceed N + 1.\n4. `(x > N) ==> (y <= 0)`: This invariant states that if x is greater than N, then y must be less than or equal to 0. Before the loop, both x and N are initialized, and the invariant holds. During the loop, when x > N, y is decremented, ensuring that y remains less than or equal to 0.\n\nThese loop invariants help Frama-C verify the post-condition `y == -1 && x >= 2 * N + 3` after the loop termination."
