The input to Frama-C is a C program file with ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations.\nFor the given program, find the necessary loop invariants of the while loop to help Frama-C verify the post-condition.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. \n- Output loop invariants that are true \n(i) before the loop execution, \n(ii) in every iteration of the loop and \n(iii) after the loop termination, \nsuch that the loop invariants imply the post condition.\n- If a loop invariant is a conjunction, split it into its parts.\n- Output all the loop invariants in one code block. For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values.

Finally, it is true after the loop termination, as the loop only terminates when `x == y`, and at that point, `lock` has the value 1.\n2. `x == \\at(y, Pre)`: This invariant is true before the loop execution since `x` is set to the value of `y` before the loop starts. It is also true in every iteration since `x` is set to `y` in the loop body. Lastly, it is true after the loop termination, as the loop only terminates when `x == y`, and at that point, `x` has the value of `y` at the loop's pre-condition.\n3. `x == y || x + 1 == y`: This invariant is true before the loop execution, as either `x` is equal to `y` or `x` is one less than `y`. It is also true in every iteration since, depending on the value of `input`, `x` will be equal to `y` or `x` will be one less than `y`.
