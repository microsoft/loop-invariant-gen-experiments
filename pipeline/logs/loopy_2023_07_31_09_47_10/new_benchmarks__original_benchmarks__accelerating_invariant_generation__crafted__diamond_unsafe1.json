It is true before the loop starts (since `x` is initialized to 0), during every iteration of the loop (since `x` is always incremented), and after the loop terminates (when `x` reaches 99).\n2. `0 <= y`: This loop invariant ensures that the value of `y` is always non-negative. Since `y` is an unsigned integer, it is always true.\n3. `(y % 2 == 0) ==> (x % 2 == 0)`: This loop invariant ensures that if `y` is even, then `x` must also be even. This is true because, in the loop body, when `y % 2 == 0`, `x` is incremented by 1, which maintains the parity of `x` the same as that of `y`.\n4. `(y % 2 != 0) ==> (x % 2 != 0)`: This loop invariant ensures that if `y` is odd, then `x` must also be odd. This is true because, in the loop body, when `y % 2 != 0`, `x` is incremented by 2, which maintains the parity of `x` the same as that of `y`."
