The loop does not involve `x` or `NONDET`, so these loop invariants are not necessary for proving the post-condition.\n2. There are no initial values assigned to `i` and `N`. Therefore, they can have garbage values, and the loop invariant `0 <= i <= N` is not guaranteed to hold at the beginning of the loop.\n3. The loop body does not have any impact on the post-condition `!(x > 1)`.\n\nTo fix these issues, we should add initial values to `i` and `N`, and then focus on the post-condition `!(x > 1)`:\n\n```\nvoid main(){\n  int NONDET;\n  int i, N;\n  int a;\n  int x;\n\n  i = 0; // Initialize i\n  N = 10; // Initialize N, you can choose any value\n\n  if (NONDET > 0) x=1; else x=2;\n\n  /*@\n    loop invariant 0 <= i <= N;\n  */\n  while (i<N){\n    i=i+1;\n  }\n\n  {;//@ assert(!(x > 1));\n}\n  return;\n}\n```\n\nHere, the loop invariant `0 <= i <= N` is sufficient to prove the termination of the loop, and since the loop body does not have any impact on the post-condition `!(x > 1)`, the post-condition should hold true as well."
