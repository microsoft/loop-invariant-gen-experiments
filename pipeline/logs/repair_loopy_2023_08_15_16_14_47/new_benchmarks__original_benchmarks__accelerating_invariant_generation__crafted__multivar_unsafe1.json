However, the variables `x` and `y` are not properly initialized in the program. The variable `x` is not initialized explicitly, so it can have any garbage value initially. This makes the loop invariants difficult to prove, and thus, they are marked as Unknown or Partially Proven.\n\nTo fix the program, we need to initialize the variable `x` properly before entering the loop. Here's the corrected version of the program:\n\n```\n#define assume(e) if(!(e)) return 0;\n\nint main(void) {\n  unsigned int x = 0;\n  unsigned int y = x + 1;\n\n  /*@\n    loop invariant 0 <= x <= 100;\n    loop invariant x <= y;\n    loop invariant y == x + 1;\n    loop invariant y <= 101;\n  */\n  while (x < 100) {\n    x++;\n    y++;\n  }\n\n  {;//@ assert(x == y);\n}\n}\n```\n\nNow, with the proper initialization of the variable `x`, the loop invariants should be sufficient to verify the post-condition in the program."
