It holds before the loop (since `len` is initialized to 0), during the loop (as `len` is only incremented by 1 in each iteration and reset to 0 when it reaches 4), and after the loop.\n\n2. `loop invariant \\forall int k; 0 <= k < len ==> a[k] == 0;`: This invariant states that all elements of the array `a` from index 0 to `len - 1` are set to 0. It holds before the loop (since `len` is 0, there are no elements to check), during the loop (as each element `a[len]` is set to 0 before incrementing `len`), and after the loop.\n\n3. `loop invariant c ==> len != 5;`: This invariant states that if the loop continues (i.e., `c` is true), then `len` must not be equal to 5. This is because the loop only terminates when `c` becomes false, which is when `len` reaches 5.\n\n4. `loop invariant !c ==> len == 5;`: This invariant states that if the loop has terminated (i.e., `c` is false), then `len` must be equal to 5. This is the desired post-condition that we want to assert after the loop.\n\nThese refined loop invariants take into account the conditional nature of the code, the bounds of the variables, and the non-deterministic nature of the loop variable `c`. These invariants should help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program."

This takes care of the conditional nature of the code where `len` is reset to 0 when it reaches 4.\n4. `(len < 4) ==> (0 <= a[len] <= 4)`: This loop invariant is an implication that states if `len` is less than 4, then the value of `a[len]` must be between 0 and 4 (inclusive).
