Given a program, you can find loop invariants, which can then be used to verify some property in the program. \nFrama-C is a software verification tool for C programs. The input to Frama-C is a C program file with ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations.\nFor the given program, find the necessary loop invariants of the while loop to help Frama-C verify the post-condition.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. \n- Output loop invariants that are true \n(i) before the loop execution, \n(ii) in every iteration of the loop and \n(iii) after the loop termination, \nsuch that the loop invariants imply the post condition.\n- If a loop invariant is a conjunction, split it into its parts.\n- Output all the loop invariants in one code block. For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values. Do not use variables that have garbage values.**\n- **Do not use keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops.**\n- **Variables that are not explicitly initialized, could have garbage values. Do not make any assumptions about such values.**\n- **Do not use the \\at(x, Pre) notation for any variable x.**\n- **Do not use non-deterministic function calls.**\n"

The first invariant, `x <= 6`, states that x will never exceed 6 during the loop execution. This is true before the loop execution (since x starts at 0), during each iteration (since x is incremented by 1), and after the loop terminates (since the loop condition is \"x < 6\").\n\n2. The second invariant, `y == 1 << x`, states that y is always equal to 2 raised to the power of x. This is true before the loop execution (since y starts at 1 and x starts at 0), during each iteration (since y is multiplied by 2 and x is incremented by 1), and after the loop terminates. This invariant also implies the post condition that `y != 12` since y will always be a power of 2 and 12 is not a power of 2."
