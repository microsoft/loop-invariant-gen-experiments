The first loop invariant is similar to the previous answer, stating that x is always odd throughout the loop.\n2. The second loop invariant states that x is always greater than or equal to 1. This is true because:\n   (i) before the loop execution, x is initialized to 0x0ffffff1 (greater than 1);\n   (ii) in every iteration of the loop, x is decremented by 2, but the loop continues only if x > 1, so x remains greater than or equal to 1;\n   (iii) after the loop termination, x is still greater than or equal to 1, and this invariant, along with the first one, implies the post-condition stating that x is not divisible by 2, as x must be an odd number greater than or equal to 1."

Since `x` is an unsigned integer, it cannot be negative.\n\n2. `x % 2 == 1`: In every iteration of the loop, `x` is always an odd number, as it starts as an odd number and we subtract 2 in every iteration, which keeps it odd.\n\n3. `x >= 1 ==> x % 2 == 1`: This loop invariant is an implication that states if `x >= 1`, then `x % 2` is always 1. This is true because `x` starts as an odd number and remains odd throughout the loop's execution. When the loop terminates, and `x` becomes 0, the implication becomes trivially true."
