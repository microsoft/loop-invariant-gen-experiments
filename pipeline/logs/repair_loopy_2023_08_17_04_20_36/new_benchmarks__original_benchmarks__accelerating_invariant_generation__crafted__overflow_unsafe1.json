We need to add an additional loop invariant for the value of `x` after the loop terminates. Here's the corrected loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 10;\n    loop invariant x % 2 == 0;\n    loop variant (UINT_MAX - x) / 2;\n*/\n```\n\nBy adding the loop variant, we provide an upper bound for the loop iterations, helping Frama-C to prove the invariants and verify the post-condition."

For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values.
