If the condition is true, the value of `z` is assigned to `y`.\n\n3.

This assertion is checked only if `size` is greater than 0. Note that since `size` is uninitialized, it could be negative, zero, or positive, and thus the assertion may or may not be checked.\n\nIn summary, the given code has uninitialized variables, making its behavior unpredictable.

Before the loop starts:\n- x is initialized to 0, so Invariant 1 is true (x >= 0).\n- m is initialized to 0, so Invariant 2 is true (m >= 0).\n- Since n can be any value (including negative values), Invariant 3 (x <= n) may or may not be true. However, if n is negative, the loop will not start, effectively making this condition true (by vacuous truth) before the loop starts.\n\n2. For the first iteration of the loop:\n- x is 0, so Invariant 1 is true (x >= 0).\n- m is 0, so Invariant 2 is true (m >= 0).\n- If x < n, the loop starts, and x is still less than or equal to n, so Invariant 3 is true (x <= n).\n\n3. For the second iteration of the loop:\n- x gets incremented by 1, so it's still non-negative, and Invariant 1 is true (x >= 0).\n- m can either stay 0 or be set to 1 (if unknown() returns true). In both cases, m is non-negative, so Invariant 2 is true (m >= 0).\n- x is incremented by 1, but it's still less than or equal to n (since the loop continues), so Invariant 3 is true (x <= n).\n\n4. After the loop finishes:\n- x is no longer less than n, but it's still non-negative, so Invariant 1 is true (x >= 0).\n- m is still non-negative (as it was either set to values of x or remained 0), so Invariant 2 is true (m >= 0).\n- Invariant 3 does not hold after the loop, as the loop terminates when x > n. However, since the loop has terminated, we are no longer concerned with this invariant.\n\nIn summary, the loop invariants that hold throughout the loop are Invariant 1 (x is always non-negative) and Invariant 2 (m is always non-negative). These invariants help in proving the correctness of the post-condition assertion that m is greater than or equal to 0 after the loop."

Some examples of valid loop invariants in ACSL format are given below:\n\nLoop invariants:\n```\nloop invariant 0 <= i <= n;\nloop invariant a == x + y * 2;\n```\n\nIf there are any conjunctions in a loop invariant, separate the conjuncts into multiple loop invariants. \nFor example, if the loop invariant is \n```\na == x + y * 2 && b == x - y * 2\n```\nthen output two loop invariants: \n```\na == x + y * 2 \nb == x - y * 2\n```\nDo not output the entire program. Output all the invariants in one block of code using the ``` tags.\n\nKeep in mind:\n1. The loop invariant is a predicate that is true before loop entry, during loop body execution and after loop exit."

Every loop invariant in ACSL starts with the words \"loop invariant\".\nWrite the loop invariants as a sequence of \"loop invariant\" annotations in the ACSL syntax used by Frama C. Some examples of valid loop invariants in ACSL format are given below:\n\nLoop invariants:\n```\nloop invariant 0 <= i <= n;\nloop invariant a == x + y * 2;\n```\n\nIf there are any conjunctions in a loop invariant, separate the conjuncts into multiple loop invariants. \nFor example, if the loop invariant is \n```\na == x + y * 2 && b == x - y * 2\n```\nthen output two loop invariants: \n```\na == x + y * 2 \nb == x - y * 2\n```\nDo not output the entire program. Output all the invariants in one block of code using the ``` tags.\n\nKeep in mind:\n1. The loop invariant is a predicate that is true before loop entry, during loop body execution and after loop exit."

If `c` is not equal to `n`, then `c` will be incremented by 1, which makes `c == 1`.\n\n3. For the second iteration of the loop:\n   After the second iteration of the loop, the loop invariant can be `c == 1 || c == 2 || c == n`.

After the loop finishes:\n   Since the condition for the loop is based on the `unknown()` function, the loop can exit at any point, making it difficult to establish a single invariant that holds after the loop finishes.

The value of `c` is either incremented (from 0 to 1) or reset to 1, depending on whether `c` is equal to `n`. In both cases, the loop invariant holds true: `c >= 1` and `c <= n`.\n\n3. For the second iteration of the loop:\n   At the beginning of the second iteration, the value of `c` is either 1 or 2 (since `n > 0`).

The loop in this code snippet has an unknown termination condition, which means we cannot guarantee when or if it will terminate. This makes it challenging to identify a standard loop invariant. However, we can still reason about some properties that hold true at various stages of the loop.\n\n1. Loop invariants before the loop starts:\n   - `c` is initialized to 0.\n   - `n` is greater than 0.\n   \n2. Loop invariants for the first iteration of the loop:\n   - `c >= 0` (since `c` is either incremented by 1 or set to 1 in the loop).\n   - `n > 0` (since `n` does not change within the loop).\n   \n3. Loop invariants for the second iteration of the loop:\n   - `c >= 0` (since `c` is either incremented by 1 or set to 1 in the loop).\n   - `n > 0` (since `n` does not change within the loop).\n\n4. Loop invariants after the loop finishes:\n   This case is difficult to determine because the loop has an unknown termination condition. However, if the loop does terminate, the following invariants can still be inferred:\n   - `c >= 0` (since `c` is either incremented by 1 or set to 1 in the loop).\n   - `n > 0` (since `n` does not change within the loop).\n\nThe loop invariants in this code snippet mainly involve the non-negative nature of `c` and the positive nature of `n`. These invariants hold true throughout the execution of the loop, regardless of the unknown conditions and the number of iterations."

For the second iteration of the loop:\n   - For the second iteration, there are multiple possible scenarios for `c`, depending on the outcomes of the unknown conditions in the first and second iterations.

However, we can state that `c` will always be non-negative and less than or equal to `n` plus the number of iterations where the first unknown condition is true, and `c` is incremented (i.e., `c > n`). This is because `c` is only incremented when both the first unknown condition is true and `c > n`."

However, we can reason about the possible values of `c` given the conditions we do know. \n\n1. Before the loop starts: \n`c` is initialized to 0, and `n` is assumed to be greater than 0. Thus, the loop invariant at this point can be `c == 0`.\n\n2. For the first iteration of the loop:\nWhen the loop starts, the first unknown condition is either true or false. If it's true and `(c > n)` holds, `c` would be incremented by 1, but since `c` is 0 initially, this condition will not hold. If the first unknown condition is false and `(c == n)` holds, `c` would be set to 1, but again, since `c` is 0 initially, this condition will not hold either. So, after the first iteration, the loop invariant can be `c == 0`.\n\n3. For the second iteration of the loop:\nAfter the first iteration, `c` remains 0. In the second iteration, similar reasoning as in the first iteration can be applied. Since `c` is still 0, the conditions `(c > n)` and `(c == n)` will not hold, and `c` will remain unchanged. So, the loop invariant after the second iteration can still be `c == 0`.\n\n4. After the loop finishes:\nSince the loop termination condition is unknown, it's difficult to determine a specific invariant that holds after the loop finishes. However, given the conditions inside the loop, we can say that the variable `c` will always be in the range `[0, n+1]`. This is because `c` can only be incremented by 1 if `(c > n)` holds, and it can only be set to 1 if `(c == n)` holds. Thus, after the loop finishes, a possible loop invariant could be `0 <= c <= n+1`.\n\nIn summary, the loop invariant `0 <= c <= n+1` seems to be valid throughout the loop, as it holds before the loop starts, during each iteration, and after the loop finishes."

For the first iteration of the loop:\n   - If the unknown condition is true:\n     - The loop invariant is `c <= n`, as `c` only gets incremented if `c > n`.\n   - If the unknown condition is false:\n     - The loop invariant is `c == 0 || c == 1`, as `c` is either unchanged (0) or set to 1 if `c == n`.\n\n3. For the second iteration of the loop:\n   - If the unknown condition is true in both iterations:\n     - The loop invariant is still `c <= n`, as `c` only gets incremented if `c > n`.\n   - If the unknown condition is true in the first iteration and false in the second:\n     - The loop invariant is `c == 1 || c == 2`, as `c` is either set to 1 if `c == n`, or incremented by 1 if `c > n`.\n   - If the unknown condition is false in both iterations:\n     - The loop invariant is `c == 0 || c == 1`, as `c` is either unchanged (0) or set to 1 if `c == n`.\n\n   In all cases, the loop invariant is `c >= 0`.\n\n4. After the loop finishes:\n   Since the loop termination condition is unknown, it is difficult to draw a specific conclusion about the loop invariants after the loop finishes. However, we can still state that `c >= 0` remains true after the loop terminates, as there is no operation in the loop that could make `c` negative."

After the loop finishes:\n   Since the loop can terminate at any point depending on the unknown conditions, the possible invariants after the loop are:\n   - `c == 0`: If the loop didn't execute or none of the conditions inside the loop were true.\n   - `c == 1`: If the loop terminated when `c` was set to 1.\n   - `c > 1`: If the loop terminated after incrementing `c` at least once.\n\nThese invariants aren't very strong, but they account for the non-deterministic nature of the loop and its branches."

This holds true because:\n\n- If `unknown()` returns `true` and `c != 4`, then `c` is incremented by `1`. Since the previous iteration ensured that `c` was in the range of `0` to `4`, incrementing `c` by `1` will still result in a value within the same range.\n- If `unknown()` returns `false` and `c == 4`, then `c` is set to `1`, which is still within the range of `0` to `4`.\n\n4.

At this point, the value of `c` must be within the range of `0` to `4` based on the logic inside the loop body, which is consistent with the post-condition that checks if `(c != 4)` and asserts that `(c <= 4)`.\n\nPlease note that the loop invariants are disjunctive, meaning there are multiple conditions that can be true within the loop depending on the behavior of the `unknown()` function."

In either case, the value of `c` will still be within the range of 0 to 4 (inclusive). As a result, the loop invariant holds true for the first iteration of the loop.\n\n3. For the second iteration of the loop:\n   - Since the loop invariant holds true for the first iteration, we know that `c` is within the range of 0 to 4 (inclusive) at the start of the second iteration. Again, the value of `c` will either remain the same, be incremented by 1, or be set to 1 depending on the `unknown()` function results.

Since the loop invariant held true for each iteration of the loop, it also holds true after the loop finishes. The value of `c` will still be within the range of 0 to 4 (inclusive).\n\nIn summary, the loop invariant of `c` being within the range of 0 to 4 (inclusive) holds true before the loop starts, for each iteration of the loop, and after the loop finishes."

For the first iteration of the loop:\n   At this point, we have two possible paths of execution depending on the return value of `unknown()`. If it returns `true`, `c` will be incremented by `1`. If it returns `false`, `c` will remain the same. Thus, the loop invariant for the first iteration of the loop is: `c == 0 || c == 1`.\n\n3. For the second iteration of the loop:\n   Since the value of `c` after the first iteration can be either `0` or `1`, we need to consider the possible outcomes for both cases during the second iteration. If `c` is `0`, it can either become `1` or remain `0`. If `c` is `1`, it can either become `2` or remain `1`. So, the loop invariant for the second iteration of the loop is: `c == 0 || c == 1 || c == 2`.\n\n4.

Since `n > 0`, `c` will either remain 0 or become 1, both of which are within the range of 0 to n inclusive.\n\n3. For the second iteration of the loop:\n   - Loop invariant: `0 <= c <= n + 1`\n   - Explanation: At the beginning of the second iteration, `c` can be anywhere between 0 and `n` inclusive. Inside the loop, `c` can either be incremented (if `c > n`) or set to 1 (if `c == n`). In any case, the value of `c` will always be within the range of 0 to `n + 1` inclusive.\n\n4. After the loop finishes:\n   - Loop invariant: `0 <= c <= n + 1`\n   - Explanation: When the loop terminates, the value of `c` is still within the range of 0 to `n + 1` inclusive, which is consistent with the loop invariant.\n\nNote that the loop invariants mentioned above are disjunctive (i.e., they do not describe a unique state), as they allow for multiple possibilities of the state of the variables `c` and `n`."

Before the loop starts:\n   - `c` is initialized to 0.\n   - `n` is assumed to be greater than 0.\n\n2.

At this point, `c` is greater than `n`.\n   - If the first unknown condition is false and `c` is equal to `n`, then `c` is set to 1.\n\n3. For the second iteration of the loop (assuming it occurs):\n   - If `c` was previously greater than `n`, it is now incremented by 1 again.\n   - If `c` was previously set to 1, then the same conditions as in the first iteration apply.\n\n4. After the loop finishes (when the unknown condition is false):\n   - `c` could be any value depending on the unknown conditions and their outcomes in each iteration.\n\nNow, considering the loop invariants:\n\nA valid loop invariant for this code snippet could be the disjunction of the following conditions:\n\n- `c == 0` or\n- `c == 1` or\n- `c > n`\n\nThis invariant holds before the loop starts (since `c == 0`), and it is maintained throughout the loop due to the conditions within the loop body. After the loop terminates, the invariant still holds true as `c` will be one of these three conditions. This loop invariant helps us reason about the post-condition, which asserts that if `c` is not equal to `n`, then `c` must be greater than or equal to 0."

In any other case, `c` remains 0.\n\n3.

If the unknown condition is false and `c` is equal to `n`, `c` is set to 1.\n\n```c\nwhile (unknown()) {\n  if (unknown()) {\n    if (c != n) {\n      c = (c + 1);\n    }\n  } else {\n    if (c == n) {\n      c = 1;\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n3. Post-conditions:\nThe post-conditions check if `c` is less than 0, greater than `n`, or equal to `n`. However, the current implementation of the post-conditions is incorrect, as it will not trigger the assertion. The correct implementation should be:\n\n```c\nif (c < 0 || c > n) {\n  assert(false);\n} else {\n  assert(c == n);\n}\n```\n\nThis will ensure that the assertion is triggered if `c` is outside the range [0, n]."

For the second iteration of the loop:\n   - `n > 0` (remains true as `n` is not modified in the loop)\n   - `c >= 0 and c <= n` (since `c` is either incremented by 1 or set to 1, it stays within these bounds)\n\n4. After the loop finishes:\n   - `n > 0` (remains true as `n` is not modified in the loop)\n   - `c >= 0 and c <= n` (since `c` is either incremented by 1 or set to 1, it stays within these bounds)\n\nNote that the loop invariants identified above are not disjunctive, as they are simple conditions that hold true throughout the loop execution. Keep in mind that due to the `unknown()` function, the behavior of the loop is non-deterministic, making it difficult to identify precise invariants that take into account the specific behavior of each iteration."

The variables `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` are also uninitialized but not used in the code.\n\n2. Loop body:\n   - The loop iterates while `x` is less than or equal to `n`. In each iteration, `y` is set to `n - x`, and `x` is incremented by 1. The loop continues until `x` is greater than `n`, so it will run `n` times if `n` is positive. If `n` is negative or zero, the loop won't execute.\n\n3. Post-conditions:\n   - After the loop, the code checks if `n > 0`. If it is, the code asserts that `y` is less than `n`. This means that the value of `y` must be in the range `[0, n)` if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, no post-condition is checked or required.\n\nIn summary, the given C code initializes some variables and executes a loop that iterates while `x` is less than or equal to `n`.

So we have `c == 2` and `z == 36 * y + 2`.\n\n4. After the loop finishes:\n   When the loop terminates, the `unknown()` function returns false, and the loop invariant conditions should still hold:\n   - `c >= 0`\n   - `y >= 127`\n   - `z >= 36 * y`\n   - Additionally, we know that after the loop, `c` will have some value between 0 and 36 (inclusive), and `z` will have a value of `36 * y + c`, where `c` is the number of times the loop was executed while `(c < 36)` was true."

After the loop finishes:\n   - The loop terminates when the `unknown()` function returns a falsy value or when `c >= 36`. We cannot reason about when `unknown()` returns a falsy value, but we can analyze the case when `c >= 36`.\n   - For Loop Invariant 1: At this point, `z == 36 * y + c` still holds as the relationship was maintained throughout the loop iterations.\n   - For Loop Invariant 2: `c >= 0` still holds as `c` was only incremented within the loop.\n   - For Loop Invariant 3: `0 <= c <= 36` may not hold after the loop finishes since it's possible that `c` has reached a value greater than 36 (e.g., when `unknown()` returns a falsy value).

For the first iteration of the loop:\n   - If i < y, i is incremented by 1, and since i was initially 0, i will still be within the range of 0 <= i <= y, thus satisfying LI1.\n   - If i >= y, then i does not change, satisfying LI2.\n\n3. For the second iteration of the loop:\n   - If i < y, i is incremented by 1 again. Since i was within the range of 0 <= i <= y in the first iteration and incremented by 1, it will still be within the same range and satisfy LI1.\n   - If i >= y, then i does not change, satisfying LI2.\n\n4.

Before the loop starts:\n\n   Since `x = -5000` and `y` has a garbage value, the invariant may not hold true initially. However, we can set `K = -5000 + y*(y-1)/2` to establish the invariant before the loop starts.\n\n2. For the first iteration of the loop:\n\n   At the beginning of the first iteration, the invariant is `x + y*(y-1)/2 = K`.\n\n   During the loop, the values of `x` and `y` are updated as follows:\n\n   ```\n   x = x + y;\n   y = y + 1;\n   ```\n\n   Now, the updated value of `x` is `x + y`. We need to check if the invariant still holds:\n\n   ```\n   (x + y) + (y + 1) * y / 2 = K\n   ```\n\n   Substituting the original value of `x` gives:\n\n   ```\n   x + y*(y-1)/2 + y = K\n   ```\n\n   Since `K = x + y*(y-1)/2`, the invariant holds for the first iteration.\n\n3.

The values of `x` and `y` are updated again, and we can observe that the invariant remains consistent.\n\n4. After the loop finishes:\n\n   When the loop terminates, `x >= 0`. At this point, the loop invariant still holds, i.e., `x + y*(y-1)/2 = K`. This invariant, combined with the post-condition `y > 0`, can be used to reason about the correctness of the algorithm and the final state of the variables.\n\nNote: The choice of loop invariant can be influenced by the problem statement and the desired properties to be proven.

For the second iteration of the loop:\n   - `y = x + 1 OR y = x + 2`: If the `unknown()` function returns false in the first iteration, `y` would be incremented by `1` (i.e., `y = x + 2`).

For the second iteration of the loop:\n   After the first iteration, the loop invariants are:\n   - `x >= 0`: As `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, it's always non-negative.\n   - `x < n`: This condition is necessary for the loop to continue executing. After the first iteration, `x` will be 1.\n   - `n > 1`: As `x` is 1 and loop condition is `x < n`, for the loop to execute the second iteration, `n` must be greater than 1.\n\n4. After the loop finishes:\n   When the loop terminates, the invariants we have are:\n   - `x >= 0`: As `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, it's always non-negative.\n   - `x >= n`: Since the loop condition is `x < n`, the termination implies `x` is no longer less than `n`. Therefore, `x` must be greater than or equal to `n`."

So, the invariant `x <= n` holds true for the first iteration.\n\n3. For the second iteration of the loop:\n   After the first iteration, the invariant `x <= n` still holds true.

Inside the loop, the following happens:\n   - If `m` is less than `a`, then `m` is assigned the value of `a`.\n   - `k` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.\n\n3. Post-conditions:\nThe post-conditions can be inferred from the `assert` statement after the loop. If `c > 0`, then the assertion checks that `a` is less than or equal to `m`. This means that after the loop, the value of `m` should be the maximum value of `a` encountered during the loop iterations. However, since the values of `a`, `c`, and `m` are uninitialized, the behavior of the code is unpredictable and the assertion might fail or succeed depending on the garbage values."

Inside the loop, the following operations are performed:\n- `(x = (x - 1));` which decrements the value of `x` by 1.\n- `(y = (y - 1));` which decrements the value of `y` by 1.\n\nThe loop will continue to execute as long as `x` is not equal to 0. During each iteration, both `x` and `y` are decremented by 1.\n\n3. Post-conditions:\nThe post-condition given in the code is:\n- `if ((i == j)) assert((y == 0));` which checks if the initial values of `x` and `y` (stored in `i` and `j`, respectively) were equal. If they were equal, the program asserts that the final value of `y` must be 0.\n\nIn summary, the given code checks whether the initial values of `x` and `y` are equal or not. If they are, the loop decrements both `x` and `y` until `x` reaches 0, and the program asserts that `y` should also be 0 at the end."

Otherwise, if either `x2` or `x3` were initially non-positive, their values have not changed.\n\nIn summary, the following loop invariants hold throughout the loop execution:\n- `d1`, `d2`, and `d3` are always equal to 1.\n- If both `x2` and `x3` are positive, their values get decremented by 1 in each iteration.

After the loop finishes:\n   - The loop invariant remains `i >= 0` because the value of `i` is only updated when `c` is within the specified range and the update ensures that `i` remains non-negative. The loop invariant holds true for all iterations of the loop and after the loop terminates.

One possible loop invariant is that `x` is always less than or equal to `n` during the loop execution.\n\n1. Before the loop starts:\n   - The loop invariant holds as `x` is initialized to 0 and `n` is assumed to be a non-negative integer, so `x <= n`.\n\n2. For the first iteration of the loop:\n   - If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and the invariant holds as `x` is still 0 and `x <= n`.\n   - If `n` is greater than 0, the loop executes and increments `x` by 1. Since `x` was 0 before the first iteration, after the increment, `x` will be 1. As `n` is greater than 0, the invariant still holds as `x (1) <= n`.\n\n3. For the second iteration of the loop:\n   - If `n` is 1, the loop does not execute the second iteration, and the invariant holds as `x` is now 1 and `x (1) <= n (1)`.\n   - If `n` is greater than 1, the loop executes and increments `x` by 1 again. Since `x` was 1 before the second iteration, after the increment, `x` will be 2. As `n` is greater than 1, the invariant still holds as `x (2) <= n`.\n\n4. After the loop finishes:\n   - When the loop terminates, the condition `x < n` is no longer true, which means `x` is now equal to `n`. The loop invariant still holds as `x (n) <= n`.\n\nBy induction, we can generalize that the loop invariant `x <= n` holds for all iterations of the loop."

At the beginning of the first iteration, `x` is 0 and `n >= 0`. If `n > 0`, the loop starts its first iteration, and the condition `x < n` holds true.\n\n3. For the second iteration of the loop:\n   - `x < n`. During the second iteration, `x` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `x == 1`. Since `n >= 0`, and `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, the condition `x < n` must still hold true for the loop to continue to the second iteration.\n\n4.
