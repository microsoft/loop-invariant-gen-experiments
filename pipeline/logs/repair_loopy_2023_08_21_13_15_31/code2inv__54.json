We need to modify the loop invariants to make them inductive and sufficient to verify the post-condition. Here's the updated loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant 0 <= c;\n  loop invariant c <= n + 1;\n  loop invariant c == 1 || c == n || c == n + 1;\n*/\n```\n\nAlthough the verifier's message states that the invariants i1 and i2 are inductive, it is still a good practice to refine them as well. In this case, they seem to be correct, so we can keep them as is. The main issue was with the loop invariant i3, which we have now refined."
