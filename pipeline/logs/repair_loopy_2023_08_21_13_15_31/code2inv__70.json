The loop increases the value of `x` by 1 in each iteration and updates the value of `y` to `n - x`. The post-condition we want to verify is `y < n` when `n > 0`.\n\nNow, let's find the loop invariants:\n\n1. The value of `x` is always increasing inside the loop, so `x` is always greater than or equal to its initial value (1).\n2. The value of `x` is always less than or equal to `n + 1`.\n3. The value of `y` is always equal to `n - x`.\n\nUsing these invariants, we can write the loop invariants as follows:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 1;\n    loop invariant x <= n + 1;\n    loop invariant y == n - x;\n*/\n```\n\nThese loop invariants hold before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination, and they imply the post-condition `y < n` when `n > 0`."
