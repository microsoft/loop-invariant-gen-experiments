Before the loop starts, the pre-condition ensures that `x` is between 0 and 50, inclusive.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, if `x` is greater than 50, it increases by 1, and if `x` is 0, it increases by 1. Otherwise, it decreases by 1. Therefore, `x` is always between 0 and 51, inclusive.\n3. After the loop terminates, the invariants ensure that `x` is between 0 and 51, inclusive.

If `x > 50`, then `x` is incremented.\n  2. If `x == 0`, then `x` is incremented.\n  3. Otherwise, `x` is decremented.\n\nNow, let's find the loop invariants that hold true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination, such that the loop invariants imply the post-condition:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant x <= 51;\n*/\n```\n\nThese loop invariants hold true because:\n1. Before the loop execution, `x` is guaranteed to be in the range [0, 50] due to the initial assumption.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, the value of `x` never goes below 0 or above 51, as it is either incremented when `x == 0` or `x > 50`, or decremented otherwise.\n3. After the loop termination, the value of `x` will still be in the range [0, 51]. Since the post-condition requires `x` to be in the range [0, 50], we can safely say that the loop invariants imply the post-condition, as 51 is only possible when the loop never executed (i.e., `unknown_bool()` returned false on the first call). In that case, the post-condition still holds true, as the initial assumption ensures `x` is in the range [0, 50]."

The pre-condition `if (!((x>=0) && (x<=50))) return 0;` ensures that if the program continues, `x` must be in the range [0, 50].\n\nNow let's analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition:\n\nThe loop condition is `unknown_bool()`, which means the loop continues executing as long as the function returns a non-zero value. We can't make any assumptions about how many iterations the loop will have.\n\nNow, let's find the necessary loop invariants that are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant x <= 51;\n*/\n```\n\nThese loop invariants ensure that:\n\n(i) Before the loop execution, `x` is in the range [0, 50] (given by the pre-condition).\n(ii) In every iteration of the loop, `x` can be at most 51, since it can only increase by 1 when `x > 50`.\n(iii) After the loop termination, when the loop exits, `x` can be in the range [0, 51]. However, since the post-condition states that `x` must be in the range [0, 50], the program must terminate only when `x <= 50`."
