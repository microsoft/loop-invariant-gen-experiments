The input to Frama-C is a C program file with ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations.\nFor the given program, find the necessary loop invariants of the while loop to help Frama-C verify the post-condition.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. \n- Output loop invariants that are true \n(i) before the loop execution, \n(ii) in every iteration of the loop and \n(iii) after the loop termination, \nsuch that the loop invariants imply the post condition.\n- If a loop invariant is a conjunction, split it into its parts.\n- Output all the loop invariants in one code block. For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values. Do not use variables that have garbage values.**\n- **Do not use keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops.**\n- **Variables that are not explicitly initialized, could have garbage values.

During the loop, `idx_in` is incremented by 1 in each iteration. Since the length of the `in` array is 11 and `in[10] = 0`, the value of `idx_in` cannot exceed 10.\n\n2. `i >= 0`: Before the loop, `i` is initialized to 0. During the loop, `i` is updated by multiplying it by 10 and then adding `j`. Since `j` is the difference between `c` and '0', it will always be a non-negative number. Therefore, `i` will always be non-negative.\n\n3. `s == in`: Before the loop, `s` is assigned the value of `in`. Throughout the loop, the value of `s` is never modified, so it remains equal to `in`.\n\n4. `\\forall integer k; 0 <= k < idx_in ==> '0' <= in[k] <= '9'`: This loop invariant ensures that all characters in the `in` array with indices from 0 to `idx_in - 1` are digits. This is true before the loop and during every iteration, as the loop condition checks whether the current character is a digit before updating `i`.\n\n5. `c == in[idx_in]`: This loop invariant ensures that `c` always holds the value at the `idx_in` position of the `in` array. This is true before the loop and during every iteration, as `c` is updated to be `in[idx_in]` in every iteration."
