Since UINT_MAX is greater than 0x0fffffff, the invariant holds.\n- During every iteration of the loop: The loop condition ensures that x is always less than 0x0fffffff, and x is incremented by 1 in each iteration. Thus, the invariant holds.\n- After the loop termination: The loop terminates when x >= 0x0fffffff. Since x is an unsigned integer, it cannot exceed UINT_MAX. Thus, the invariant holds.\n\nThese loop invariants imply the post condition as follows:\n- After the loop termination, x must be greater than 0x0fffffff (as specified by the assert statement). Since the loop invariant guarantees that x is less than or equal to 0x0fffffff during the loop execution, the loop termination ensures that x will be greater than 0x0fffffff after the loop execution, which is the desired post-condition."
