For all variables, add conjunctions that bound the maximum and minimum values that they can take, if such bounds exist.\n3. If a variable is always equal to or smaller or larger than another variable, add a conjunction for their relation.\n4. If the assertion is guarded by a condition, use the guard condition in an implication.\n5. If certain variables are non-deterministic at the beginning or end of the loop, use an implication to make the invariant trivially true at that location.\n\nWith these guidelines in mind, the revised loop invariants for the given program would be:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 1 <= x <= 101;\n    loop invariant x <= 101 ==> y == 100 - x + 1;\n    loop invariant x > 101 ==> y < 100;\n*/\n```\n\nThese invariants satisfy the given guidelines and hold before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. They also imply the post-condition `y < 100`."
