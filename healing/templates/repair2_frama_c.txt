Great. Let's think step by step. Is it a syntax error or an error with the invariant? How can we fix these invariants? Only changing the loop invariants written as 'loop invariant ...' is allowed. The following hints might help:

If it is an invariant error:
1. If the invariant cannot be proved on loop entry, could you alter the invariant to conditionally hold only after loop entry by adding an implies clause? Or, could you alter the invariant to hold on loop entry as well?
2. If the invariant could not be proven to be maintained, could you make the invariant stronger or fix it in another way?
3. If the assertion i.e. the post-condition could not be proved fully, could you add more loop invariants or make the existing invariants stronger?
4. Would rewriting the invariant expressions help? Eg. converting division to multiplication
5. Do the invariant expressions have the correct types? Eg. are they integer expressions when they should be boolean expressions?

If it is a syntax error:
- To refer to a variable's value in the beginning of the loop, you cannot use keywords like 'old', 'initial', etc. 
Instead, make the expression conditional on loop entry using an implies clause. 
Eg. 'loop invariant i == 0 ==> i == x'  instead of 'loop invariant i_initial == x', for a loop that starts with i = 0.
- To refer to a variable's value in the end of the loop, you cannot use keywords like 'new', 'final', etc.
Instead, make the expression conditional on loop exit using an implies clause.
Eg. 'loop invariant i == 100 ==> i == y'  instead of 'loop invariant i_final == y', for a loop that ends with i = 100.
- You are not allowed to use '\at(x, Pre)' in a loop invariant since all the loop variables in this case are local to the function, hence not defined before the function executes. 
Therefore, use the variable name and value from the pre-condition or the assignments from before the loop starts.
- Do not use symbols or keywords that are not supported by the ACSL format
- Do not introduce new variables or functions that are not given in the program
- Do not modify the program in any way other than the loop invariants

Keep in mind:
1. Changing the semantics of the original program is not allowed
2. You are allowed to attempt fixes to the invariants beyond the given hints
3. Disjunctive invariants are allowed
4. If an invariant is a conjunction of multiple expressions, you can try splitting the conjunction into multiple invariants
5. You are allowed to remove invariants that are incorrect
