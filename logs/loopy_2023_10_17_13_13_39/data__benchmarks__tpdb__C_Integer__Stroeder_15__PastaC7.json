                    },
                    "First, let's analyze the loop:\n\n```\nwhile (i <= 100 && j <= k) {\n    i = j;\n    j = i + 1;\n    k = k - 1;\n}\n```\n\nWe can observe that `i`, `j`, and `k` are the variables changing within the loop. The loop condition tells us that it will keep executing as long as `i <= 100` and `j <= k`. Now, let's try to find the ranking function for this loop.\n\nNotice that in each iteration, `j` is assigned the value of `i + 1`, and `k` is decremented by 1. This means that the difference between `k` and `j` will decrease by 2 in each iteration. Therefore, we can use the expression `(k - j)` as the ranking function.\n\nHere's the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant k - j;\n*/\n```\n\nNow let's verify that it is a valid ranking function:\n\n1. The value of the expression `(k - j)` is positive for the loop to continue executing. Since the loop condition is `j <= k`, we know that the value of `(k - j)` is non-negative as long as the loop is executing.\n\n2. The value of the expression `(k - j)` decreases with every successive iteration of the loop. As previously mentioned, in each iteration, `j` is incremented by 1, and `k` is decremented by 1, causing the difference `(k - j)` to decrease by 2.\n\nThus, `(k - j)` is a valid ranking function for this loop, as it satisfies both the conditions for a ranking function.",
                    "First, let's identify the loop in the given program:\n\n```\nwhile (i <= 100 && j <= k) {\n    i = j;\n    j = i + 1;\n    k = k - 1;\n}\n```\n\nThe loop continues executing as long as both `i <= 100` and `j <= k` conditions are met. Now let's find the ranking function.\n\nWe can see that, in each iteration, the value of `i` is updated to the value of `j`, the value of `j` is updated to `i + 1`, and the value of `k` is decreased by 1.\n\nWe need to find an expression (or sequence of expressions) that decreases with every iteration of the loop and is positive for the loop to continue executing.\n\nIn this case, we can choose the following ranking function:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant k - j + 1;\n*/\n```\n\nNow, let's explain why this is a valid ranking function:\n\n1. The value of the expression `k - j + 1` is positive for the loop to continue executing. This is because `j <= k` is a loop condition. If `j` were greater than `k`, the loop would terminate.\n\n2. The value of the expression `k - j + 1` decreases with every iteration of the loop. In each iteration, `j` is increased by 1, and `k` is decreased by 1. Therefore, the value of the expression `k - j + 1` is reduced by 2 in each iteration.\n\nSince the ranking function is positive and decreases with every iteration, it is a valid ranking function, and it proves that the loop must terminate.",
                    "First, let's analyze the loop conditions and the variables involved in the loop:\n\n1. The loop continues executing as long as `i <= 100` and `j <= k`.\n2. The variable `i` is updated to the value of `j`.\n3. The variable `j` is updated to the value of `i + 1`.\n4. The variable `k` is updated to the value of `k - 1`.\n\nNow, let's try to identify a ranking function that satisfies the conditions mentioned earlier.\n\nWe can notice that `k` is decreasing in every iteration of the loop (`k = k - 1`). Since `k` can't be negative (due to the loop condition `j <= k`), the loop will eventually terminate. Therefore, we can use `k` as the ranking function.\n\nHere is the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```c\n/*@\n    loop variant k;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because:\n\n1. The value of `k` decreases with every successive iteration of the loop (`k = k - 1`).\n2. The value of `k` must be positive (non-negative) for the loop to continue executing, as `j <= k`.",
                    "First, let's analyze the loop and its variables:\n\n1. `i` is initially set to some unknown integer value.\n2. `j` is initially set to some unknown integer value.\n3. `k` is initially set to some unknown integer value.\n4. The loop executes as long as `i <= 100` and `j <= k`.\n5. Inside the loop, `i` is set to `j`, `j` is incremented by 1, and `k` is decremented by 1.\n\nNow let's find a ranking function for this loop. Since `i` is always set to `j` and `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, we know that `i` and `j` are strictly increasing. Meanwhile, `k` is strictly decreasing as it is decremented by 1 in each iteration. Since `j <= k` is a loop condition, we can use the difference between `k` and `j` as a ranking function. This difference will always be non-negative and strictly decreasing.\n\nHere is the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant k - j;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because:\n\n1. It is non-negative: `j <= k` implies `k - j >= 0`.\n2. It strictly decreases in each iteration: `j` increases by 1 and `k` decreases by 1, so `k - j` decreases by 2.\n3. The loop terminates when the ranking function is no longer positive, which is when `j > k`. Since the loop condition is `j <= k`, this ensures that the loop will terminate.",
                    "First, let's analyze the loop:\n\n```\nwhile (i <= 100 && j <= k) {\n    i = j;\n    j = i + 1;\n    k = k - 1;\n}\n```\n\nThe loop continues to execute as long as the conditions `i <= 100` and `j <= k` are true. Inside the loop, the values of i, j, and k change as follows:\n\n1. i takes the value of j.\n2. j takes the value of i + 1.\n3. k is decremented by 1.\n\nNow, let's find the ranking function. We want a lexicographic ranking function that decreases in every iteration and is positive as long as the loop continues to execute.\n\nThe ranking function for this loop is:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant k - j + 1;\n*/\n```\n\nExplanation:\nThe loop invariant `k - j + 1` is valid for the following reasons:\n\n1. The value of the expression `k - j + 1` is positive as long as the loop continues to execute. This is because the loop condition `j <= k` ensures that `k - j >= 0`. Adding 1 to this ensures that the expression is positive.\n\n2. The value of the expression `k - j + 1` decreases in every iteration of the loop. In each iteration, `j` is incremented by 1, and `k` is decremented by 1. This means that the difference `k - j` decreases by 2 in every iteration. Therefore, the whole expression `k - j + 1` decreases by 2 as well.\n\nSince the ranking function is positive and decreases in every iteration of the loop, it is a valid ranking function for the given loop. This ranking function helps to prove that the loop must terminate."
