                    "First, let's identify the loop in the given program:\n\n```\nwhile (fac != j) {\n    fac = fac * i;\n    i = i+1;\n}\n```\n\nThe loop continues to execute as long as `fac` is not equal to `j`. Now, let's find a ranking function for this loop.\n\nWe need an expression that decreases with every iteration of the loop and is positive for the loop to continue executing. In this case, we can use the following ranking function:\n\n```\nj - fac\n```\n\nNow let's explain why it is a valid ranking function:\n\n1. The value of the ranking function is positive for the loop to continue executing: Since the loop condition is `fac != j`, it means that `j - fac > 0` when the loop is executing.\n\n2. The value of the ranking function decreases with every iteration of the loop: In each iteration of the loop, `fac` is multiplied by `i`, and `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` starts at 1 and is always incremented by 1, it is always positive. Therefore, in each iteration, `fac` increases, and thus, `j - fac` decreases.\n\nSo, the ranking function for the given loop is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant j - fac;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because it is positive for the loop to execute and decreases with every iteration of the loop, ensuring that the loop must terminate.",

In each iteration, `fac` is multiplied by `i`, and `i` is incremented by 1. We need to find a ranking function that decreases with every iteration and is positive while the loop is executing.\n\nA suitable ranking function for this loop is:\n\n```\nj - fac\n```\n\nNow, let's explain why this is a valid ranking function.\n\n1. Positivity: As long as the loop is executing, `fac` is not equal to `j`. This means that `j - fac` is always positive.\n\n2. Decreasing: In each iteration, `fac` is multiplied by `i`, and `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is always greater than or equal to 1, `fac` will always increase in each iteration. Therefore, `j - fac` will always decrease.\n\nSo, the ranking function for the loop is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant j - fac;\n*/\n```",
                    "First, let's identify the loop in the given program:\n\n```\nwhile (fac != j) {\n    fac = fac * i;\n    i = i+1;\n}\n```\n\nNow, let's find a ranking function for this loop. The ranking function should be a positive integer expression that decreases with every iteration of the loop. We can use the difference between `j` and `fac` as the ranking function:\n\n```\nj - fac\n```\n\nNow, let's show that this is a valid ranking function.\n\n1. The value of the ranking function is positive for the loop to continue executing: Since `fac != j` is the loop condition, when the loop is executing, `j - fac` will always be positive.\n\n2. The value of the ranking function decreases with every successive iteration of the loop: In each iteration, `fac` is multiplied by `i`, and `i` is incremented by 1. Thus, `fac` is increasing, and as a result, `j - fac` is decreasing.\n\nSo, the ranking function for the given loop is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant j - fac;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid as it satisfies the required conditions of being positive for the loop to execute and decreasing with every iteration of the loop.",
                    "First, let's analyze the loop in the given program:\n\n```c\nwhile (fac != j) {\n    fac = fac * i;\n    i = i + 1;\n}\n```\n\nThe loop continues to execute as long as `fac` is not equal to `j`. In each iteration, `fac` is multiplied by `i`, and `i` is incremented by 1.\n\nNow, let's find the ranking function for this loop:\n\nWe can choose `j - fac` as the ranking function. This is because, in each iteration, the value of `fac` increases, causing the value of `j - fac` to decrease.\n\nNow let's check if this ranking function is valid:\n\n1. The value of the ranking function decreases with every successive iteration of the loop: As `fac` increases in each iteration, the value of `j - fac` decreases.\n\n2. The value of the ranking function must be positive for the loop to continue executing: Since the loop continues to execute as long as `fac != j`, it is guaranteed that `j - fac > 0` for the loop to continue.\n\nSo, the ranking function is valid. In ACSL syntax, it is written as:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant j - fac;\n*/\n```",
                    "First, let's identify the loop in the program:\n\n```\nwhile (fac != j) {\n    fac = fac * i;\n    i = i+1;\n}\n```\n\nNext, we need to find a ranking function for this loop. We can see that both `fac` and `i` are updated in the loop body. We can use a lexicographic ranking function with two expressions: `(j - fac, -i)`.\n\nNow, let's explain why this is a valid ranking function:\n\n1. The value of each expression must be positive for the loop to execute. In this case, since the loop condition is `fac != j`, we have `j - fac > 0`. Also, since `i` is initialized to `1` and incremented in the loop, we have `-i < 0`.\n\n2. Either the first expression decreases, or its value remains the same and the second expression decreases. In this loop, if `fac != j` in the beginning of an iteration, either `fac` gets closer to `j` (thus, `j - fac` decreases), or it remains the same (in which case, `i` is incremented and `-i` decreases).\n\nHere's the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant j - fac;\n    loop variant -i;\n*/\n```"
