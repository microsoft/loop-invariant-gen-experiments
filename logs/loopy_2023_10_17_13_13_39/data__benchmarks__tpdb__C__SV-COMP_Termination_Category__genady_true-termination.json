                    "First, let's identify the loop in the given program:\n\n```\nfor (int i = 10000; i-j >= 1; i--) {\n  j++;\n}\n```\n\nNow, let's find the ranking function for this loop. Since we have two variables, i and j, that are changing in the loop, we will use a lexicographic ranking function. The lexicographic ranking function for this loop is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant i;\n    loop variant 10001 - i - j;\n*/\n```\n\nNow, let's explain why it is a valid ranking function:\n\n1. i starts at 10000 and decreases by 1 in every iteration. Therefore, the value of the first expression (i) is always positive and decreases in every iteration.\n\n2. The value of the second expression (10001 - i - j) is also always positive because the initial values of i and j are 10000 and 1, respectively, and the loop condition ensures that i - j >= 1. Since i decreases and j increases in every iteration, the value of (10001 - i - j) either decreases or remains the same in every iteration.\n\n3. Whenever the value of the first expression (i) remains the same, which is not possible in this case because i always decreases, the value of the second expression (10001 - i - j) must decrease. This property holds for our lexicographic ranking function.\n\nTherefore, the given lexicographic ranking function is valid for the loop in the program.",
                    "First, let's identify the loop variables. In this case, we have two loop variables: `i` and `j`.\n\nNow let's find a lexicographic ranking function for the loop. We can observe that the value of `i` decreases in every iteration and the value of `j` increases. Since `i` starts from 10000 and `j` starts from 1, we can create the following lexicographic ranking function:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant i;\n    loop variant 10000 - j;\n*/\n```\n\nThis is a valid ranking function because:\n\n1. The value of `i` is positive for the loop to execute (`i-j >= 1`) and decreases in every iteration (`i--`).\n2. The value of `10000 - j` is positive for the loop to execute (since `j` starts at 1 and increases) and decreases in every iteration (`j++`).\n\nHence, this lexicographic ranking function proves that the loop must terminate.",
                    "First, we need to find the expressions that decrease with each iteration of the loop and are positive as long as the loop continues to execute. In this case, we have two variables, `i` and `j`, which are being updated in each iteration. Since `i` is decreasing and `j` is increasing, we can consider `(i, -j)` as the lexicographic ranking function.\n\nNow, let's write the ranking function using ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant i;\n    loop variant -j;\n*/\n```\n\nTo prove that this is a valid ranking function, we need to check if the value of each expression is positive for the loop to execute and if either `i` decreases or `i` remains the same, then `-j` must decrease.\n\n1. Initially, `i` is set to 10000 and `j` is set to 1, so both expressions are positive.\n2. The loop condition is `i - j >= 1`, which means the loop will continue to execute as long as both expressions are positive.\n3. In each iteration, `i` is decreased by 1, and `j` is increased by 1.\n\nSince the value of `i` decreases with each iteration and the value of `-j` also decreases with each iteration (as `j` increases), we can conclude that `(i, -j)` is a valid lexicographic ranking function for the given loop."
