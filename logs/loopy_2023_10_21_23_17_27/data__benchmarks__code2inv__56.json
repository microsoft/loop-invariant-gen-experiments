This means that we do not know how many times the loop will iterate or terminate. \n- Inside the loop, there is an if-else statement with two conditions. If the first condition is true and `c` is greater than `n`, then `c` is incremented by 1. If the second condition is true and `c` is equal to `n`, then `c` is set to 1.\n\nNext, let's find the loop invariants:\n\n- Before the loop execution, we know that `c` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, we can add the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant c >= 0;\n    loop invariant n > 0;\n*/\n```\n- In every iteration of the loop, `c` is either incremented by 1 or set to 1. Therefore, we can add the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant (c == 1) || (c > 1 && c <= n);\n*/\n```\n- After the loop termination, we know that the loop condition is false, which means that `unknown()` is false. Therefore, we can add the following loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant (unknown() == 0);\n*/\n```\n- Finally, the assertion is guarded by the condition `(c == n)`. Therefore, we can add the following loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant (c == n) ==> (n <= -1);\n*/\n```\n- We also need to add loop invariants to handle the non-deterministic values of `unknown()` inside the loop. We can use an implication to make the loop invariants true when `unknown()` is false. Therefore, we can add the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant (unknown() == 1) ==> true;\n    loop invariant (unknown() == 0) ==> true;\n*/\n```\nPutting it all together, we get the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant c >= 0;\n    loop invariant n > 0;\n    loop invariant (c == 1) || (c > 1 && c <= n);\n    loop invariant (unknown() == 1) ==> true;\n    loop invariant (unknown() == 0) ==> true;\n    loop invariant (unknown() == 0);\n    loop invariant (c == n) ==> (n <= -1);\n*/\n``` \n\nThese loop invariants are sufficient to verify the post-condition of the program."
