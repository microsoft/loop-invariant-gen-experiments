Therefore, the values of `x` and `y` are always greater than or equal to 0.\n- Also, the sum of `x` and `y` is always equal to the sum of `i` and `j`.\n- After the loop termination, we know that the value of `y` is 0. Therefore, if `i` is not equal to `j`, then the value of `x` must be non-zero at some point during the loop execution. However, the loop condition guarantees that `x` will become 0 at some point during the loop execution. Therefore, the assertion `i != j` can only be false if `y` is 0 and `i` is equal to `j`.",
