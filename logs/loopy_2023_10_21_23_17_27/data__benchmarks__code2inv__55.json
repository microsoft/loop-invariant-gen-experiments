Here are some possible loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant 0 <= c <= n + 1;\n*/\n```\nExplanation: `c` is initialized to 0 and can only be incremented or set to 1 inside the loop. Therefore, `c` can never be negative. Also, `c` can never be greater than `n + 1`, because if `c` is equal to `n + 1`, then the next execution of the loop will set `c` to 1. \n\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant (c == n + 1) ==> (unknown() == 0);\n*/\n```\nExplanation: If `c` is equal to `n + 1`, then the next execution of the loop will set `c` to 1. Therefore, if `c` is equal to `n + 1`, then `unknown()` must be false. \n\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant (c <= n) ==> (unknown() == 1);\n*/\n```\nExplanation: If `c` is less than or equal to `n`, then the condition `(c > n)` in the nested conditional statement will always be false, and therefore the inner if statement will never be executed. Therefore, if `c` is less than or equal to `n`, then `unknown()` must be true. \n\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant (c == n) ==> (unknown() == 0);\n*/\n```\nExplanation: If `c` is equal to `n`, then the condition `(c == n)` in the nested conditional statement will always be true, and therefore the inner if statement will only be executed if `unknown()` is false. Therefore, if `c` is equal to `n`, then `unknown()` must be false. \n\nNow let's combine all the loop invariants into one code block:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= c <= n + 1;\n    loop invariant (c == n + 1) ==> (unknown() == 0);\n    loop invariant (c <= n) ==> (unknown() == 1);\n    loop invariant (c == n) ==> (unknown() == 0);\n*/\n```\n\nThese loop invariants imply the post-condition of the program, which is `(c == n)` if `c` is less than or equal to `n`, and `(c == n)` if `c` is greater than `n`. Therefore, the program is verified by Frama-C if these loop invariants hold true.",
