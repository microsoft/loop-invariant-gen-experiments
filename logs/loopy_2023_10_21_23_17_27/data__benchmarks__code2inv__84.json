Therefore, we can add the loop invariant x < 0 to ensure that x is negative before the loop starts.\n- In every iteration of the loop, y is incremented by 1: We need to ensure that y is incremented by 1 in every iteration of the loop to ensure that y is positive after the loop terminates.

Therefore, we can add the loop invariant x+y <= 0 to ensure that the value of x+y is non-positive in every iteration of the loop.\n- After the loop termination, y is positive: We need to ensure that y is positive after the loop terminates because the assertion is y > 0.
