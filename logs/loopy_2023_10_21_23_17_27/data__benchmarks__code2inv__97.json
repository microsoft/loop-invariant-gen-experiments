Therefore, after `i` iterations, `j` would be `2 * i`, which is equal to `y * i`.

Therefore, we can use implication to state that if `i > x`, then `j` must be equal to `y * x`. This follows from the fact that the loop invariant states that `j` is equal to `y * (i - 1)` at the end of each iteration, and since `i` will be `x + 1` after the loop terminates, we get `j = y * x` when `i > x`.\n\nPutting it all together, we get the following loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant j == 0;\n    loop invariant y == 2;\n    loop invariant i <= x;\n    loop invariant j == y * (i - 1);\n    loop invariant i > x ==> j == y * x;\n*/\n```",

We assume that `x >= 0` as there are no constraints on its value.\n- In every iteration of the loop, we want to show that `j` is always equal to `y * i`. Since `j` is incremented by `y` in each iteration, we can show by induction that `j` is always equal to `y * i`. We also assume that `y == 2` and `x >= 0` as they are not modified in the loop.\n- After the loop termination, we want to show that `i` is greater than `x` or equal to `x + 1` and `j` is equal to `y * x`. We use implication to handle the conditional nature of the code. If `i` is greater than `x`, then the loop condition fails and the loop terminates. Therefore, `j` is equal to `y * x` in this case. If `i` is equal to `x + 1`, then the loop condition fails and the loop terminates. Therefore, `j` is equal to `y * x` in this case as well.
