The loop body contains two statements that update the values of `x` and `y`. We can add loop invariants that bound the maximum and minimum values of `x` and `y` that can be reached in each iteration.\n\nLoop invariant:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= x <= 30;\n    loop invariant 0 <= y <= 30;\n*/\n```\nThe above loop invariant is true before the loop starts because of the pre-conditions on `x` and `y`. It is also true in every iteration of the loop because the loop body only updates `x` and `y` with positive values, so their values can only increase. It is also true after the loop terminates because the loop condition is `unknown()`, which means that we don't know how many times the loop executed. Therefore, `x` and `y` can be any value between 0 and 30.\n\nNext, we need to add a loop invariant that implies the post-condition.

It is also true in every iteration of the loop because the loop body does not change the value of `x`. It is also true after the loop terminates because we know that `x` is either 20 or some other value. If `x` is not equal to 20, then the implication is trivially true. If `x` is equal to 20, then the implication implies that `y` is not equal to 0.\n\nFinally, we can add a conjunction that bounds the maximum and minimum values of `x` and `y` at the end of the program.\n\nConjunction:\n```\n/*@ \n    ensures 0 <= x <= 30 && 0 <= y <= 30;\n*/\n```\nThe above conjunction is true after the loop terminates because of the loop invariant we added earlier.\n\nTherefore, the complete set of loop invariants and conjunctions is:\n\n```\n#define assume(e) if(!(e)) return 0;\nextern int unknown(void);\n\nint main() {\n  \n  int x;\n  int y;\n  int z1;\n  int z2;\n  int z3;\n  \n  assume((x >= 0));\n  assume((x <= 10));\n  assume((y <= 10));\n  assume((y >= 0));\n  \n  /*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= x <= 30;\n    loop invariant 0 <= y <= 30;\n    loop invariant (x == 20) ==> (y != 0);\n  */\n  while (unknown()) {\n    {\n    (x  = (x + 10));\n    (y  = (y + 10));\n    }\n\n  }\n  \n  /*@ \n    ensures 0 <= x <= 30 && 0 <= y <= 30;\n  */\n  if ( (x == 20) )\n  {;\n    //@ assert( (y != 0) );\n  }\n\n}\n```",
