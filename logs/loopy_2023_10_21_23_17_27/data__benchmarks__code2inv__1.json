                    "First, let's consider the pre-conditions and variable assignments:\n```\nint x;\nint y;\n\n(x = 1);\n(y = 0);\n```\nThis means that `x` is initialized to 1 and `y` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts. \n\nNext, let's analyze the loop body and loop condition:\n```\nwhile ((y < 100000)) {\n    {\n    (x  = (x + y));\n    (y  = (y + 1));\n    }\n}\n```\nThe loop condition is `y < 100000` and the loop body updates the values of `x` and `y`.\n\nNow, let's find the necessary loop invariants:\n- Before the loop execution:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 1;\n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n*/\n```\nThese invariants are true before the loop starts because `x` is initialized to 1 and `y` is initialized to 0.\n\n- In every iteration of the loop:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant y >= 0 && y <= 100000;\n    loop invariant x >= 1 && x >= y;\n*/\n```\nThese invariants are true in every iteration of the loop because the loop condition is `y < 100000`. Therefore, `y` is always between 0 and 100000. The update statement `x = x + y` means that `x` is always increasing by at least `y` in each iteration. Since `y` is increasing by 1 in each iteration, `x` is always greater than or equal to `y`.\n\n- After the loop termination:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant y >= 100000;\n    loop invariant x >= 100000;\n    loop invariant x >= y;\n    loop invariant x == (5000050000);\n*/\n```\nThese invariants are true after the loop terminates because the loop condition is `y < 100000`. Therefore, `y` becomes 100000 after the loop terminates. Since `x` is increasing by `y` in each iteration of the loop, after 100000 iterations, `x` becomes `5000050000`. Therefore, `x` is greater than or equal to `y` and both `x` and `y` are at their maximum values.\n\nPutting all the loop invariants together:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 1;\n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n    loop invariant y >= 0 && y <= 100000;\n    loop invariant x >= 1 && x >= y;\n    loop invariant y >= 100000;\n    loop invariant x >= 100000;\n    loop invariant x >= y;\n    loop invariant x == (5000050000);\n*/\n```\nThese loop invariants are sufficient to prove that the post-condition is true, which is `x >= y`.",
                    "The pre-conditions and variable assignments in the program are:\n```\nPre-conditions: None\nVariable Assignments:\n- x is assigned the value 1\n- y is assigned the value 0\n```\n\nThe loop condition is `y < 100000`.\n\nWe need to find loop invariants that are true:\n- before the loop execution\n- in every iteration of the loop\n- after the loop termination\n\nsuch that the loop invariants imply the post condition `x >= y`.\n\nLet's consider the loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant 0 <= y <= 100000;\n  loop invariant 1 <= x <= y + 100000;\n  loop invariant x >= y;\n*/\n```\nExplanation of the loop invariants:\n- The first loop invariant `0 <= y <= 100000` is true before the loop execution since `y` is assigned the value `0`. It is also true in every iteration of the loop since `y` is incremented by `1` in each iteration and the loop condition checks that `y` is less than `100000`. Finally, it is true after the loop termination since `y` is greater than or equal to `100000`.\n- The second loop invariant `1 <= x <= y + 100000` is true before the loop execution since `x` is assigned the value `1`. It is also true in every iteration of the loop since `x` is updated as `x + y` and `y` is incremented by `1` in each iteration. Thus, `x` can be at most `y + 100000`. Finally, it is true after the loop termination since `x` is greater than or equal to `y`.\n- The third loop invariant `x >= y` is true before the loop execution since `x` is assigned the value `1` and `y` is assigned the value `0`. It is also true in every iteration of the loop since `x` is updated as `x + y` and `y` is incremented by `1` in each iteration. Finally, it is true after the loop termination since `x` is greater than or equal to `y`.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants above are sufficient to verify the post-condition `x >= y`."
