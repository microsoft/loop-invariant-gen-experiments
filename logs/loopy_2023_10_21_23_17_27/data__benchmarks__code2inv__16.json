This covers the case where `m` is not assigned a value within the loop.\n- The fifth invariant `m >= 0 ==> m <= n` ensures that if `m` is greater than or equal to 0, then `m` is also less than or equal to `n`.\n- The sixth invariant `(m < 0 || m <= n) ==> m >= 0` ensures that if `m` is less than 0 or `m` is less than or equal to `n`, then `m` is also greater than or equal to 0. This covers the case where `m` is not assigned a value within the loop.\n\nThe post-condition is `m >= 0`. The sixth invariant already implies this. Therefore, we do not need to add another invariant for the post-condition.",
