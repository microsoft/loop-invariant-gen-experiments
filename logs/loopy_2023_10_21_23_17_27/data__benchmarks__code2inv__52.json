Since `c` represents some kind of counter, its value can't be larger than the maximum value it can hold, which in this case is 4. Therefore, `c <= 4`.\n- In every iteration of the loop, `c` still can't be smaller than 0 or larger than 4, so `c >= 0 && c <= 4`. \n- The first conditional inside the loop checks if `unknown()` is true. If it is, then `c` can be incremented if it's not already 4. This means that `unknown() && c <= 3` implies `c + 1`. \n- The second conditional inside the loop checks if `unknown()` is false. If it is, then `c` should be reset to 1 if it was already 4. This means that `!unknown() && c == 4` implies `c == 1`.\n- After the loop termination, the only thing we know for sure is that `c` must be 4. So, `c == 4`. \n\nFinally, we can put these invariants together and write them in the required format:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant c >= 0 && c <= 4;\n    loop invariant (unknown() && c <= 3) ==> c + 1;\n    loop invariant (!unknown() && c == 4) ==> c == 1;\n*/\n```",

This is because if `c` is 4, it means the loop has executed 4 times, and since the loop condition is non-deterministic, there is no guarantee that the loop will execute again.

Therefore, it must be true that `c >= 0`. We also know that the maximum value `c` can take is 4 because of the assertion at the end of the program. Therefore, the invariant before the loop execution is `c >= 0 && c <= 4`.\n- In every iteration of the loop, there are two cases to consider. If `unknown()` returns a non-zero value, then the code inside the `if` block will be executed, otherwise the code inside the `else` block will be executed. \n    - If `unknown()` returns a non-zero value and `c != 4`, then `c` is incremented by 1, and therefore `c` will always be between 1 and 4. However, if `c` is initially 0, then it will remain 0. Therefore, we can write the invariant as `((unknown() && c != 4) ==> (c >= 1 && c <= 4)) && ((unknown() && c == 0) ==> (c >= 0 && c <= 0))`.\n    - If `unknown()` returns a zero value and `c == 4`, then `c` is assigned the value 1, and therefore `c` will always be between 1 and 3. However, if `c` is initially less than 4, then it will remain the same. Therefore, we can write the invariant as `((!unknown() && c == 4) ==> (c >= 1 && c <= 4)) && ((!unknown() && c != 4) ==> (c >= 1 && c <= 3))`.\n- After the loop termination, we need to ensure that the final value of `c` satisfies the assertion `(c == 4) ==> ((c >= 0) && (c <= 4))`. If `c == 4`, then it must be true that `c >= 0 && c <= 4`. If `c != 4`, then the assertion is vacuously true. Therefore, the invariant is `(c == 4) ==> ((c >= 0) && (c <= 4))`.",
