After the loop termination:\n    - `m <= x`\n    - `n >= 0`\n    - `x >= n`\n    - `(n > 0) ==> (m < n)`\n\nExplanation:\n1. Before the loop execution:\n    - `m <= x`: since `m` is initialized to 0 and `x` is initialized to 0, the inequality holds before the loop starts.\n    - `n >= 0`: since `n` is not initialized and contains garbage value, we cannot infer anything about its value. However, since the loop condition is `x < n`, we know that if `n` is negative, the loop will not execute. Hence, we can safely assume that `n` is non-negative.\n\n2. In every iteration of the loop:\n    - `m <= x`: this is the same as the invariant before the loop execution.\n    - `n >= 0`: this is the same as the invariant before the loop execution.\n    - `(m == \\old(m) && x == \\old(x)) || (unknown() ==> m == x)`: this invariant captures the fact that `m` is updated only when `unknown()` returns true. If `unknown()` returns true, then `m` is updated to `x`, otherwise `m` remains the same as before the loop iteration. Note that the `unknown()` function is non-deterministic and can return either true or false.\n    \n3. After the loop termination:\n    - `m <= x`: this is the same as the invariant before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop.\n    - `n >= 0`: this is the same as the invariant before the loop execution.\n    - `x >= n`: since the loop condition is `x < n`, when the loop terminates, it must be the case that `x >= n`.\n    - `(n > 0) ==> (m < n)`: this invariant captures the fact that if `n` is positive, then `m` must be strictly less than `n` to satisfy the assertion. We use implication here because the assertion is guarded by the condition `n > 0`. If `n` is non-positive, then the assertion is vacuously true.",
