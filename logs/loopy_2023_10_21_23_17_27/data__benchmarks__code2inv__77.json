This is because the post-condition requires that if i is less than y, then it must be less than x. \n- Since the loop condition depends on the non-deterministic function `unknown()`, we cannot reason about the number of iterations that the loop will execute. Therefore, we cannot bound the maximum or minimum values that i can take. \n- Since x and y are non-negative integers and x is greater than or equal to y, we do not need to add any additional invariants for these variables.\n- Since the assertion is not guarded by any condition, we do not need to use an implication.",
