If it is not true, it returns 0 and terminates the program.\n\nVariable assignments:\n\n- `d1 = 1;` assigns the value 1 to the variable `d1`.\n- `d2 = 1;` assigns the value 1 to the variable `d2`.\n- `d3 = 1;` assigns the value 1 to the variable `d3`.\n- `x1 = 1;` assigns the value 1 to the variable `x1`.\n\nLoop condition:\n\n- The loop runs as long as the value of `x1` is greater than 0.\n\nLoop invariants:\n\n- `x1 >= 0`\n- `x2 >= 0 ==> x2 <= x1`\n- `x3 >= 0 ==> x3 <= x1`\n- `x1 > 0 ==> (x2 <= 0 || x3 <= 0)`\n- `x1 >= 0 && x2 >= 0 && x3 >= 0`\n\nExplanation:\n\n- The loop invariant `x1 >= 0` is true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop. It is also true after the loop termination. This invariant is necessary because the loop condition is that `x1` is greater than 0, so it must be non-negative.\n- The loop invariant `x2 >= 0 ==> x2 <= x1` is true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop. It is also true after the loop termination. This invariant is necessary because `x2` is decremented by `d2` in each iteration of the loop. Since `d2` is positive and `x2` is non-negative, `x2` must be less than or equal to `x1`.\n- The loop invariant `x3 >= 0 ==> x3 <= x1` is true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop. It is also true after the loop termination. This invariant is necessary because `x3` is decremented by `d3` in each iteration of the loop. Since `d3` is positive and `x3` is non-negative, `x3` must be less than or equal to `x1`.\n- The loop invariant `x1 > 0 ==> (x2 <= 0 || x3 <= 0)` is true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop. It is also true after the loop termination. This invariant is necessary because the loop terminates when `x1` is not greater than 0. If `x1` is greater than 0, then either `x2` or `x3` must be less than or equal to 0 in order for the loop to terminate. This invariant is expressed using implication, because if `x1` is not greater than 0, then the condition `x2 <= 0 || x3 <= 0` is automatically true.\n- The loop invariant `x1 >= 0 && x2 >= 0 && x3 >= 0` is true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop. It is also true after the loop termination. This invariant is necessary because all three variables `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` are decremented in each iteration of the loop, and we need to ensure that they remain non-negative.",
