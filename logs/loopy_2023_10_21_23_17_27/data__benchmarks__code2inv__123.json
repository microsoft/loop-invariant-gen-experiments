We cannot make any assumptions about these variables.\n- The variable `sn` is initialized to 0.\n- The variable `i` is initialized to 1.\n\nNext, let's analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition:\n- The loop condition is `(i <= size)`.\n- The loop body consists of two assignments: `(i  = (i + 1))` and `(sn  = (sn + 1))`.\n\nNow, let's output the necessary loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 1 <= i <= size + 1;\n    loop invariant 0 <= sn <= i - 1;\n    loop invariant \\forall integer j; 1 <= j < i ==> sn >= j - 1;\n    loop invariant i > size ==> sn == size;\n*/\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The first loop invariant states that `i` is always between 1 and `size + 1`.

Therefore, `i` is always greater than or equal to `1`, and less than or equal to `size+1` (since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration and the loop condition is `i <= size`). Hence, `1 <= i <= size+1`.\n- `sn` is assigned `0` before the loop and then incremented by `1` in each iteration. Therefore, `sn` is always equal to `i-1`.\n- After the loop terminates, `i` is greater than `size` and `sn` is equal to `i-1`. Therefore, if `sn` is not equal to `0`, then it must be equal to `size`.
