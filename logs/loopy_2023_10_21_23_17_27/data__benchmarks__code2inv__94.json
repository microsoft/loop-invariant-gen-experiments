This is true because in each iteration of the loop, i is incremented by 1 and j is incremented by i, so j will be the sum of the first i+1 positive integers at the end of each iteration.\n\nNow, we need to show that the loop invariants imply the post-condition:\n\nPost-condition: (i + (j + k)) > (2 * n)\n\nWe can use the loop invariants to prove the post-condition as follows:\n\n(i) Before the loop execution:\n- i = 0, so i + (j + k) = j + k\n- j = 0, so j <= (n+1)*(n+2)/2, which implies j + k <= (n+1)*(n+2)/2 + k\n- Therefore, j + k >= k and j + k <= (n+1)*(n+2)/2 + k\n\nSubstituting into the post-condition, we get:\nj + k > 2*n - i\n\nSince i is 0 before the loop execution, the post-condition is equivalent to:\nj + k > 2*n\n\n(ii) In every iteration of the loop:\n- The loop invariants 1, 2, and 3 hold true\n- Substituting the loop invariants 2 and 3 into the post-condition, we get:\n(i + ((i*(i+1))/2 + k)) > (2 * n)\n- Simplifying, we get:\ni*i/2 + i/2 + k > n\n- Multiplying by 2, we get:\ni*i + i + 2*k > 2*n\n- This is true because i and k are both non-negative, and the loop invariant 2 implies that i <= n+1\n\n(iii) After the loop termination:\n- The loop invariant 2 holds true\n- i > n, so i + (j + k) = (n+1) + (j + k)\n- Substituting the loop invariant 2 into the post-condition, we get:\n(n+1) + ((n+1)*(n+2)/2 + k) > 2*n\n- Simplifying, we get:\n(n+1)*(n+3)/2 + k > 2*n\n- This is true because n is non-negative, and the loop invariant 1 implies that k >= 0\n\nPutting it all together, the loop invariants are:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i >= 0;\n    loop invariant j >= 0;\n    loop invariant i <= n+1;\n    loop invariant j <= (n+1)*(n+2)/2;\n    loop invariant (i <= n) ==> ((i*(i+1))/2 <= j <= ((i+1)*(i+2))/2);\n*/\n```",

Therefore, after the loop termination, we have `i > n`. Also, since `j` is updated by adding `i` in each iteration, the final value of `j` is `1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = (n * (n + 1)) / 2`. Therefore, we have `(j + k) >= k` and `(j + k) >= (n * (n + 1)) / 2`. Combining these inequalities, we get `(j + k) >= max(k, (n * (n + 1)) / 2)`. Therefore, we have `(i + (j + k)) >= (i + max(k, (n * (n + 1)) / 2))`. Since `i > n`, we have `i >= (n + 1)`. Therefore, we have `(i + (j + k)) >= ((n + 1) + max(k, (n * (n + 1)) / 2))`. Simplifying this inequality, we get `((i - 1) + (j + k)) >= max(k, (n * (n + 1)) / 2) + n`. Therefore, we have `((i - 1) + (j + k)) > (2 * (i - 1)) ==> ((i + (j + k)) > (2 * n))`.",

Therefore, `j` is always greater than or equal to its previous value, which is the sum of the first `i-1` positive integers. This sum is `i * (i - 1) / 2`. Therefore, `j` is always greater than or equal to `i * (i - 1) / 2 + i = i * (i + 1) / 2`.\n- After the loop:\n  - The loop terminates when `i` becomes greater than `n`. Therefore, `i > n` holds.\n  - At the termination of the loop, `j` is equal to the sum of the first `n` positive integers, which is `n * (n + 1) / 2`. Therefore, `j >= n * (n + 1) / 2`.\n  - `k` is non-negative by assumption.\n\nUsing these loop invariants, we can verify the post-condition as follows:\n- Before the assertion, `i + (j + k)` is greater than or equal to `i + (i * (i + 1) / 2) + k`, since `j` is greater than or equal to `i * (i + 1) / 2`. \n- After the loop, we know that `i > n`, so `i >= n + 1`. Therefore, `i * (i + 1) / 2 >= (n + 1) * n / 2 = n * (n + 1) / 2 + n / 2`. Therefore, `i * (i + 1) / 2 + k >= n * (n + 1) / 2 + n / 2 + k`.\n- Combining the two inequalities, we get `i + (j + k) >= n * (n + 1) / 2 + n / 2 + k > 2 * n` if `n >= 1`.

Therefore, i <= n is a loop invariant.\n  - The loop body assigns j to j + i, which means that j is incremented by at least i in every iteration. Since i can take any value between 0 and n, inclusive, j is incremented by at least 0, 1, 2, ..., n in the respective iterations. Therefore, j >= 0 and j >= i are loop invariants.\n- After the loop termination:\n  - The loop terminates when i > n. Therefore, we need to add an implication to the post-condition that states that if i > n, then the post-condition holds. Using some algebraic manipulation, we can show that (i + (j + k)) > (2 * n) is equivalent to (i - n) + j > n - k. Therefore, we can restate the post-condition as (i - n) + j > n - k. Now, we can add the implication i > n ==> (i - n) + j > n - k as a loop invariant. Note that the left-hand side of the implication is trivially true at the beginning of the loop, because i is initially set to 0 and n is assumed to be non-negative.",
