This invariant implies that `x` will eventually reach 0 or a lower value.\n- The loop invariant `y <= \\at(y, Pre);` ensures that `y` is not increasing in the loop. This invariant implies that `y` will eventually reach 0 or a lower value.\n- The loop invariant `i == x ==> y == j;` ensures that `y` is equal to `j` when `x` is equal to `i`. This invariant holds because the assignment `(j = y)` happens before the loop and the loop only modifies `x` and `y`.\n- The loop invariant `y <= x;` ensures that `y` is always less than or equal to `x` inside the loop. This invariant holds because both `x` and `y` are decremented by the same amount in each iteration of the loop.\n- The loop invariant `(x == 0) ==> (y == \\at(y, Pre) - \\at(x, Pre));` ensures that when `x` becomes 0, `y` is equal to its initial value `y` minus `x`. This invariant holds because `x` is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, and the loop runs until `x` becomes 0. \n\nNote that we do not need to add any implication for non-deterministic variables, because all variables are assigned deterministic values before the loop. We also do not need to add any implication for the assertion, because it is not guarded by any condition."

Hence, `x >= 0` and `y >= 0`.\n- Also, since `i` is assigned the value of `x` and `j` is assigned the value of `y` before the loop, we want to ensure that `i` always equals `x` and `j` always equals `y`. Hence, `i == x` and `j == y`.\n- After the loop termination, we want to ensure that if `i` is equal to `j`, then `y` must be equal to 0. This is because `i` and `j` are assigned the values of `x` and `y` before the loop, and if `i` and `j` are equal, then `x` and `y` must have been decremented by the same amount in each iteration of the loop. Therefore, `y` must be equal to 0. Hence, `i == j ==> y == 0`.\n- Note that we do not need any non-deterministic variable assumptions, as all variables are explicitly assigned values before the loop.",
