Therefore, we can add the following loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant i <= x; */\n```\n- The loop body has two statements that modify the variables i and j. We need to make sure that the loop invariant still holds after these statements are executed. Therefore, we can add the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant i <= x;\n    loop invariant j == (i-1)*y; */\n```\n- The above loop invariants hold before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop.\n- After the loop termination, the loop invariant i <= x still holds, and j == (i-1)*y also holds. Therefore, we can use the following loop invariants to verify the post-condition:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant i <= x;\n    loop invariant j == (i-1)*y;\n    loop invariant (i > x) ==> (i != j) ==> (y != 1); */\n```\n- The last loop invariant uses implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code.

Also, since `i` increments by `1` in every iteration, the maximum value of `j` will be `(i - 1) * y`.\n- `i > x ==> i = x + 1`\n    - This implies that the loop will terminate when `i` becomes greater than `x` and at that point, `i` will be equal to `x + 1`.\n- `(i = j) ==> (y != 1)`\n    - If `i` is equal to `j`, then the loop has terminated.

But, if `i` is equal to `x + 1`, then the loop condition would not hold and the loop would not have terminated.
