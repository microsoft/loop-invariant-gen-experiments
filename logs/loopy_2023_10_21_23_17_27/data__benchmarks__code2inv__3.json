Since y and z are non-deterministic at the beginning of the loop, we cannot make any assumptions about their values. However, we can say that if z is greater than or equal to y, then after the loop, z must be greater than or equal to the maximum value of y that was seen during the loop execution (which is \\old(y)). Similarly, y must be less than or equal to the minimum value of y that was seen during the loop execution (which is \\old(y)). Therefore, we have z >= y ==> (z >= \\old(y) && y >= \\old(y)).\n- In every iteration: We know that x is incremented by 1 in every iteration, so x > \\old(x) holds. Again, since y and z are non-deterministic at the beginning of the loop, we cannot make any assumptions about their values. However, we can say that if z is greater than or equal to y, then after the loop, z must be greater than or equal to the maximum value of y that was seen during the loop execution (which is y). Similarly, y must be less than or equal to the minimum value of y that was seen during the loop execution (which is \\old(y)). Therefore, we have z >= y ==> (z >= y && y >= \\old(y)). Also, if z is less than or equal to y, then we know that y does not change in this iteration. Therefore, y must be less than or equal to the minimum value of y that was seen during the loop execution (which is \\old(y)). Similarly, z must be greater than or equal to the maximum value of z that was seen during the loop execution (which is \\old(z)). Therefore, we have x > \\old(x) && y <= \\old(y) && z >= \\old(z) && z <= \\old(y) ==> (z >= y && y >= \\old(y)).\n- After the loop: We know that the loop terminates when x becomes 5, so x >= 5 holds. Also, we know that y is the minimum value of y that was seen during the loop execution, and z is the maximum value of z that was seen during the loop execution. Therefore, we have z >= y. \n\nNote that the loop invariants imply the post-condition.",

Since y and z are non-deterministic at the beginning of the loop, we cannot make any assumptions about their values. However, we can say that if z is greater than or equal to y, then after the loop, z must be greater than or equal to the maximum value of y that was seen during the loop execution (which is \\old(y)). Similarly, y must be less than or equal to the minimum value of y that was seen during the loop execution (which is \\old(y)). Therefore, we have z >= y ==> (z >= \\old(y) && y >= \\old(y)).\n- In every iteration: We know that x is incremented by 1 in every iteration, so x > \\old(x) holds. Again, since y and z are non-deterministic at the beginning of the loop, we cannot make any assumptions about their values. However, we can say that if z is greater than or equal to y, then after the loop, z must be greater than or equal to the maximum value of y that was seen during the loop execution (which is y). Similarly, y must be less than or equal to the minimum value of y that was seen during the loop execution (which is \\old(y)). Therefore, we have z >= y ==> (z >= y && y >= \\old(y)). Also, if z is less than or equal to y, then we know that y does not change in this iteration. Therefore, y must be less than or equal to the minimum value of y that was seen during the loop execution (which is \\old(y)). Similarly, z must be greater than or equal to the maximum value of z that was seen during the loop execution (which is \\old(z)). Therefore, we have x > \\old(x) && y <= \\old(y) && z >= \\old(z) && z <= \\old(y) ==> (z >= y && y >= \\old(y)).\n- After the loop: We know that the loop terminates when x becomes 5, so x >= 5 holds. Also, we know that y is the minimum value of y that was seen during the loop execution, and z is the maximum value of z that was seen during the loop execution. Therefore, we have z >= y. \n\nNote that the loop invariants imply the post-condition.",
