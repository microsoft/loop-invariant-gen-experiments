Therefore, we need to consider two cases:\n    - Case 1: If m is not updated in an iteration, then its value remains the same as in the previous iteration. Therefore, we can add the following loop invariant:\n    ```\n    /*@ \n        loop invariant m <= \\at(m, LoopEntry);\n    */\n    ```\n    - Case 2: If m is updated in an iteration, then its value becomes equal to x in that iteration. Therefore, we can add the following loop invariant:\n    ```\n    /*@ \n        loop invariant (unknown() ==> m == x);\n    */\n    ```\n- After the loop terminates, x is greater than or equal to n. Therefore, the following loop invariant is true after the loop termination:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= n;\n*/\n```\n- Finally, we can use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the assertion. The assertion is guarded by the condition (n > 1). Therefore, we can add the following loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant (n <= 1) || (m < n);\n*/\n``` \nPutting everything together, the loop invariants for the given program are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 1;\n    loop invariant m >= 1;\n    loop invariant x > \\at(x, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant m <= \\at(m, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant (unknown() ==> m == x);\n    loop invariant x >= n;\n    loop invariant (n <= 1) || (m < n);\n*/\n```",

Therefore, we can only infer that `x` is greater than or equal to 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1.\n- Before the loop executes, `m` is initialized to 1. Therefore, `m` is greater than or equal to 1.\n- In every iteration of the loop, `x` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `x` is always greater than or equal to 1.\n- In every iteration of the loop, if `unknown()` returns true, then `m` is updated to `x`. Therefore, `m` is less than or equal to `x`.\n- In every iteration of the loop, if `x` is less than `n`, then `m` is less than `n`. This is because if `x` is less than `n`, then the assertion `m < n` will eventually be checked and this assertion will only hold if `m` is less than `n`.\n- After the loop terminates, `x` is no longer less than `n`, which implies that `x` is greater than or equal to `n`.\n- After the loop terminates, if `n` is greater than 1, then the assertion `m < n` will be checked. Therefore, if the assertion is true, then `m` must be less than `n`.",

Therefore, we can only infer that `x` is greater than or equal to 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1.\n- Before the loop executes, `m` is initialized to 1. Therefore, `m` is greater than or equal to 1.\n- In every iteration of the loop, `x` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `x` is always greater than or equal to 1.\n- In every iteration of the loop, if `unknown()` returns true, then `m` is updated to `x`. Therefore, `m` is less than or equal to `x`.\n- In every iteration of the loop, if `x` is less than `n`, then `m` is less than `n`. This is because if `x` is less than `n`, then the assertion `m < n` will eventually be checked and this assertion will only hold if `m` is less than `n`.\n- After the loop terminates, `x` is no longer less than `n`, which implies that `x` is greater than or equal to `n`.\n- After the loop terminates, if `n` is greater than 1, then the assertion `m < n` will be checked. Therefore, if the assertion is true, then `m` must be less than `n`.",
