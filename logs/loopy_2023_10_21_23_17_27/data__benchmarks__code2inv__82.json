Hence, `i` is always less than or equal to `x` after the loop terminates.\n- `i >= y ==> i >= i_old + 1`: This invariant states that if `i` is greater than or equal to `y`, then it must have been incremented by 1 in the current iteration. This is true because the loop condition checks if `unknown()` returns true and the if condition inside the loop only increments `i` if `i < y`.\n- `!(i >= y) ==> (i >= i_old)`: If `i` is less than `y`, then it will not be incremented in the current iteration.

Therefore, in each iteration of the loop, if `i < y`, then `i` is incremented by 1. Hence, `i` is always less than or equal to `y` in every iteration of the loop.\n- `i <= x`: The loop continues until `unknown()` returns false. Therefore, `i` can be incremented at most `y` times in the loop. Hence, `i` is always less than or equal to `x` after the loop terminates.\n- `i >= y ==> i >= i_old + 1`: This invariant states that if `i` is greater than or equal to `y`, then it must have been incremented by 1 in the current iteration. This is true because the loop condition checks if `unknown()` returns true and the if condition inside the loop only increments `i` if `i < y`.\n- `!(i >= y) ==> (i >= i_old)`: If `i` is less than `y`, then it will not be incremented in the current iteration. Hence, `i` will have the same value as in the previous iteration.\n- `!(i >= x) ==> (i <= i_old)`: If `i` is less than `x`, then it will not be incremented in the current iteration. Hence, `i` will have the same value as in the previous iteration, or a smaller value if it was already less than `i_old`. This ensures that `i` is always less than or equal to `x` after the loop terminates.\n\nFinally, the post-condition assertion is guarded by the condition `(i >= x) && (0 > i)`. Therefore, we can use this condition in an implication to obtain the following loop invariant:\n\n- `(i >= x) && (0 > i) ==> (i >= y)`\n\nThis invariant ensures that if the condition `(i >= x) && (0 > i)` holds, then the assertion `(i >= y)` must also hold.",
