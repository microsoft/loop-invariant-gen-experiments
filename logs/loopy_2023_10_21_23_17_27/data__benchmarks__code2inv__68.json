After the loop termination:\n   - Since the loop terminates when `x` becomes greater than `n`, `x` must be equal to `n + 1`.\n   - Since `y` is assigned the value of `n - x` at the end of the loop, it must be equal to `n - (n + 1)`, which is equivalent to `-(n + 1) <= y <= n - (n + 1)`. Using implication, we can simplify this to `y <= n`.\n   - `n` is a non-negative integer, so it must be greater than or equal to `0`.",
