Therefore, `c` can never be greater than or equal to 40 in the loop.\n- Loop invariant 6: If the assertion is executed, then `(c >= 0)` is true. This is true after the loop termination because of the loop condition. If `c` is not equal to 40, then the assertion will be executed and `(c >= 0)` will be true.\n\nPutting all the loop invariants together:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= c <= 40;\n    loop invariant c > 0;\n    loop invariant c <= 40;\n    loop invariant ((c == 40) ==> (c = 1));\n    loop invariant ((c != 40) ==> (c = c_old + 1));\n    loop invariant ((c != 40) ==> (c >= 0));\n*/\n```",

This is necessary because if `c` is equal to `40`, then `c` is reset to `1`. Therefore, all values less than `c` must not be equal to `40` to avoid unnecessary resets.\n- Since `unknown()` is non-deterministic, we cannot make any assumptions about the values of `c` before or after the loop. Therefore, we do not need to add any additional implications to handle non-deterministic values. \n- The post-condition is guarded by the condition `(c != 40)`. Therefore, we can use this condition in an implication to ensure that the assertion holds only if `(c != 40)` is true.",

If so, it returns 0.\n- The program declares an external function `unknown` which has no implementation in this file.\n- The program declares an integer variable `c`.\n- The statement `(c = 0)` initializes the variable `c` to 0.\n\nLoop condition:\n- The while loop executes as long as the function `unknown()` returns a non-zero value.\n\nLoop invariants:\n- Since `c` is initialized to 0 before the loop, we can add the following loop invariant before the loop:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant 0 <= c <= 40; */\n```\n- Inside the loop, the value of `c` changes based on certain conditions. We need to ensure that `c` remains within the bounds of 0 and 40. We can add the following loop invariant inside the loop:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant 0 <= c <= 40; */\n```\n- The loop invariant inside the loop is not sufficient to prove the post-condition. We need to add more loop invariants that capture the behavior of the loop more precisely. We can use implication to express the behavior of the loop as follows:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant 0 <= c <= 40;\n    loop invariant (c == 40) ==> (unknown() == 0);\n    loop invariant (c != 40) ==> (unknown() != 0); */\n```\n- The first loop invariant is the same as before. The second loop invariant says that if `c` is equal to 40, then the function `unknown()` must return 0. This is because the program assigns `c` the value of 1 when `c` is equal to 40. The third loop invariant says that if `c` is not equal to 40, then the function `unknown()` must return a non-zero value. This is because the program increments the value of `c` by 1 when `c` is not equal to 40. \n\nPost-condition:\n- The post-condition of the program is `assert(c >= 0)` if `c` is not equal to 40. We can use implication to express this post-condition as follows:\n```\nif (c != 40) {\n  /*@ assert c >= 0; */\n}\n```\n- We use the guard condition `c != 40` in an implication to express the post-condition."

This is because the loop runs while `unknown()` is true, and if `c` is 0 and `unknown()` is false, the loop would terminate immediately and the assertion would not be checked.\n- The third invariant ensures that `c` does not decrease during the loop execution. This is because `c` is only increased inside the loop, and the loop runs while `unknown()` is true. Therefore, if `c` is not 0 at the beginning of the loop, it must be greater than or equal to its previous value.\n- The fourth invariant ensures that `unknown()` is true if `c` is 40 at the end of an iteration. This is because if `c` is 40, it is set to 1 or remains 40 based on the value of `unknown()`, and the loop runs while `unknown()` is true.\n- The fifth invariant ensures that `c` is not 40 at the end of an iteration if it was not 40 at the beginning of the iteration. This is because if `c` is not 40, it is either increased by 1 or set to 1 based on the value of `unknown()`, and the loop runs while `unknown()` is true. Therefore, `c` cannot be 40 at the end of an iteration if it was not 40 at the beginning of the iteration.\n- The sixth invariant ensures that if `c` is 40 at the end of an iteration, it must be between 1 and 40 (inclusive) at the beginning of the next iteration. This is because if `c` is 40, it is set to 1 at the end of the iteration, and the loop runs while `unknown()` is true. Therefore, `c` must be between 1 and 40 (inclusive) at the beginning of the next iteration.\n- The seventh invariant ensures that if `c` is not 40 at the end of an iteration, it must be between 1 and 39 (inclusive) at the beginning of the next iteration. This is because if `c` is not 40, it is increased by 1 at the end of the iteration, and the loop runs while `unknown()` is true.
