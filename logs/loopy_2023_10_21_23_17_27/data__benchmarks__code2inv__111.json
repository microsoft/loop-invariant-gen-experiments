Therefore, `i` is always greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n+1`.\n- `0 <= sn <= i-1`\n    - Explanation: Before the loop, `sn` is initialized to 0.

It asserts that if the loop condition is true, then the sum of `sn` and `i-1` is equal to `n`. This can be proved by induction. Initially, `i=1` and `sn=0`, so the invariant holds. In each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 and `sn` is incremented by 1, so the sum of `sn` and `i-1` increases by 1. Therefore, the invariant holds in every iteration of the loop. After the loop, if `sn != 0`, then the post-condition requires that `sn == n`. Since `sn+i-1 == n` and `i > 1`, we have `i-1 >= 1` and `sn <= i-1`, so `sn+i-1 <= 2*(i-1)`. Therefore, if `sn != 0`, then `sn+i-1 == n` implies `sn == n`.",

This gives us the loop invariant `sn == 0 && i == 1 && n > 0`.\n- In every iteration of the loop, we can see that `i` is incremented by 1 and `sn` is incremented by 1.

If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, then the loop invariant `sn == i-2` implies that `sn` is equal to `n` because `i` is equal to `n+1`. If `i` is greater than `n`, then the assertion is trivially true. Thus, we can infer that `(i == n+1) ==> (sn == n)`.",

Therefore, `i` is always greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n+1`.\n- `0 <= sn <= i-1`\n    - Explanation: Before the loop, `sn` is initialized to 0.

It asserts that if the loop condition is true, then the sum of `sn` and `i-1` is equal to `n`. This can be proved by induction. Initially, `i=1` and `sn=0`, so the invariant holds. In each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 and `sn` is incremented by 1, so the sum of `sn` and `i-1` increases by 1. Therefore, the invariant holds in every iteration of the loop. After the loop, if `sn != 0`, then the post-condition requires that `sn == n`. Since `sn+i-1 == n` and `i > 1`, we have `i-1 >= 1` and `sn <= i-1`, so `sn+i-1 <= 2*(i-1)`. Therefore, if `sn != 0`, then `sn+i-1 == n` implies `sn == n`.",
