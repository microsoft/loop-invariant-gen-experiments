The formula `\\at(x, Pre) + \\at(\\sum, Here(sn)) - \\at(sn, Pre)` represents the value of `x` at the current iteration, which is equal to the value of `x` at the previous iteration (`\\at(x, Pre)`) plus the increment in `x` (`1`) plus the increment in `sn` (`\\at(\\sum, Here(sn)) - \\at(sn, Pre)`), where `\\at(\\sum, Here(sn))` is the sum of all increments of `sn` from the beginning of the loop until the current iteration.\n- The third loop invariant is true in every iteration of the loop because `sn` is incremented by a non-negative value. The formula `\\at(sn, Pre) + \\at(\\sum, Here{\\nothing}) - \\at(sn, Pre)` represents the value of `sn` at the current iteration, which is equal to the value of `sn` at the previous iteration (`\\at(sn, Pre)`) plus the increment in `sn` (`\\at(\\sum, Here{\\nothing}) - \\at(sn, Pre)`), where `\\at(\\sum, Here{\\nothing})` is the sum of all increments of `sn` from the beginning of the loop until the current iteration, including the increment in the current iteration (which is 0 because there is no increment in `sn` in the current iteration).\n- The fourth loop invariant is true after the loop termination because `sn` is either non-negative or equal to -1 (if the loop terminated because `unknown()` returned 0). If `sn == -1`, then `\\at(sn, Pre) == -1` because of the implication. If `sn != -1`, then `sn` is equal to `x` because of the post-condition.",

Therefore, we use an implication to make the invariant true at the beginning of the loop:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant \\true ==> (sn >= 0) && (x >= 0); */\n```\n- In every iteration of the loop, `sn` and `x` are incremented by 1.
