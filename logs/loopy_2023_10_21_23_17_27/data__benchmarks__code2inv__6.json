This is true because the loop body updates `y` to be the minimum of `y` and `z` whenever `z` is less than or equal to `y`.

This is because `y` is updated to `z` only when `z <= y`.\n- After loop termination: `z >= y ==> (size > 0) ==> (z >= y)`: This implies that if `z >= y`, then `size` must be greater than 0 for the assertion to hold true.

We also know that z should be greater than or equal to y at the end of each iteration, so we include this as a loop invariant. Finally, we include a loop invariant that states that for all values of i between 1 and x (inclusive), z should be greater than or equal to y. This is because whenever we set y = z, we are essentially saying that all previous values of z were greater than or equal to y.\n- After loop termination, we know that x is between 0 and size. We also know that z should be greater than or equal to y at the end of the loop. If size is less than or equal to 0, then the assertion does not need to hold true, so we include a loop invariant that covers this case.
