This is true in every iteration of the loop.\n- The seventh invariant `n < 0 ==> x = \\old(x)` ensures that if `n` is negative, then `x` remains the same throughout the loop. This is true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop, but it is trivially true before the loop execution because `x` is not initialized.\n- The eighth invariant `(n >= 0 && x = 0) ==> (\\at(x, Pre) = n)` ensures that if `n` is non-negative and `x` becomes zero, then the original value of `x` is equal to `n`.
