However, we can assume that `n >= 0` since it is not possible for `n` to be negative.\n- Since the loop condition is `(x < n)`, we know that `n >= x` is true in every iteration of the loop.\n- The statement `(x = (x + 1))` increments the value of `x` by `1`. Therefore, the invariant `(x >= \\old(x) && x <= n) ==> (x == \\old(x) + 1)` holds in every iteration of the loop. Here, `\\old(x)` represents the value of `x` before the loop iteration.\n- If the loop terminates, then `(x >= n)` is true. However, the `if` statement after the loop checks if `(x != n)`. This implies that the loop terminated because the loop condition `(x < n)` became false, which in turn implies that `x == n`. Therefore, `((x >= n) && (x != n))` is false after the loop termination. In other words, if `x` is not equal to `n` after the loop, then the loop did not terminate. Using implication, we can say that `((x >= n) && (x != n)) ==> (n < 0)`. This is because the assertion in the `if` statement is `n < 0`.",
