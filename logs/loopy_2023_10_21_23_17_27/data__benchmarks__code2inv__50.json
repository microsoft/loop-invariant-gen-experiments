Therefore, the only condition that we can assume to be true before the loop execution is that `c` is non-negative. Hence, we have `c >= 0`.\n- In every iteration of the loop:\n  - The loop body modifies the value of `c` based on some conditions. The maximum value that `c` can take is 4, and the minimum value that `c` can take is 0 (since `c` is non-negative). Therefore, we have `c >= 0` and `c <= 4`.\n- After the loop termination:\n  - The loop termination condition is `!unknown()`. Therefore, we know that the loop has terminated when `unknown()` returns false. We need to ensure that the final value of `c` satisfies the post-condition of the program, which is `if ( (c != 4) ) { //@ assert( (c >= 0) ); }`.\n  - If `c` is not equal to 4, then the post-condition is satisfied. Hence, we have `(c == 4) ==> \\old(c) != 4`.\n  - If `c` is equal to 4, then we need to ensure that its previous value was not 4. This is because the loop body changes the value of `c` when `c` is equal to 4. Hence, we have `(\\old(c) == 4) ==> (c == 1)`.\n  - Finally, we need to ensure that `c` is non-negative and not greater than 4.

Therefore, we need to find loop invariants that imply `if ( (c != 4) ) { (c >= 0); }`.\n- One possible loop invariant is `0 <= c <= 4`. This is because `c` is initially assigned the value 0, and can only take values between 0 and 4 (inclusive) in the loop.\n- Another possible loop invariant is `c != 5`.

This is because if `c` is equal to 3, then it cannot be equal to 4, since `c` can only take values between 0 and 4 (inclusive) in the loop.\n- Another possible loop invariant is `(c == 4) ==> (unknown() || c == 1)`.

Otherwise, `c` is set to 1 if the second call to `unknown()` returns a non-zero value and `c == 4`. Hence, `c >= 0` is true in every iteration of the loop.\n    1. `c >= 0`: This is the same as the invariant before the loop execution.\n    2. If `c == 4`, then the previous value of `c` must have been 3. This is because if `c == 4`, then the next value of `c` must be 1. Therefore, `c` must have been 3 before it was incremented to 4.\n    3. If `c != 4`, then the value of `c` must not have decreased from its previous value. This is because `c` can only be incremented in the loop and cannot be decreased. Therefore, if `c != 4`, its value must not have decreased from its previous value.\n- After the loop termination, `c` can only be equal to 4 if it was previously incremented from 3. Therefore, `c >= 0` must be true if `c == 4`. Hence, `(c == 4) ==> (c >= 0)` is true.",

Otherwise, `c` is set to 1 if the second call to `unknown()` returns a non-zero value and `c == 4`. Hence, `c >= 0` is true in every iteration of the loop.\n    1. `c >= 0`: This is the same as the invariant before the loop execution.\n    2. If `c == 4`, then the previous value of `c` must have been 3. This is because if `c == 4`, then the next value of `c` must be 1. Therefore, `c` must have been 3 before it was incremented to 4.\n    3. If `c != 4`, then the value of `c` must not have decreased from its previous value. This is because `c` can only be incremented in the loop and cannot be decreased. Therefore, if `c != 4`, its value must not have decreased from its previous value.\n- After the loop termination, `c` can only be equal to 4 if it was previously incremented from 3. Therefore, `c >= 0` must be true if `c == 4`. Hence, `(c == 4) ==> (c >= 0)` is true.",
