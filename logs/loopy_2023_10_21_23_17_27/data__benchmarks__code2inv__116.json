This is true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop because in each iteration, `sn` is incremented by 1 and `x` is incremented by at least 1 due to the loop condition.

This is true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop because in each iteration, `x` is incremented by 1 and `sn` is incremented by at least 1 due to the loop condition. Therefore, `x` is always less than or equal to `sn+1`.\n- `(sn != x) ==> (sn == -1)`: if `sn` is not equal to `x`, then the assertion `(sn == -1)` must hold. This is because the only assertion in the program is guarded by the condition `(sn != x)`. If this condition is true, then `sn` must be equal to -1 in order for the assertion to hold. If the condition is false, then the assertion does not need to hold and the loop can terminate without any further constraints. Note that we use implication instead of if-then to express this constraint in ACSL. \n\nTherefore, the complete loop invariant is:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= sn <= x+1;\n    loop invariant 0 <= x <= sn+1;\n    loop invariant (sn != x) ==> (sn == -1);\n*/\n```",

Finally, it is true after the loop execution because `sn` cannot be greater than `x` due to the loop condition and `sn` cannot be less than `0`.\n    - The second loop invariant `v1 <= x` is true before the loop execution because there are no constraints on `x`. It is also true during the loop execution because `x` is incremented by `1` in each iteration. It is true after the loop execution because `v1` is not defined in the program.\n    - The third loop invariant `v2 <= sn` is true before the loop execution because there are no constraints on `sn`.

It is also true during the loop execution because `sn` and `x` are both incremented by `1` in each iteration. It is true after the loop execution because `v3` is not defined in the program.\n- The post-condition `(sn == -1)` is guarded by the condition `sn != x`.

This is because `x` is incremented by `1` in each iteration of the loop, while `sn` is incremented by an unknown value. Therefore, `x` is always less than or equal to `sn`.\n- The second and third loop invariants `-1 <= sn <= INT_MAX` and `-1 <= x <= INT_MAX` bound the values of `sn` and `x` within the range of `int` datatype. This is because `sn` and `x` are used to count the number of loop iterations, and the number of iterations cannot be negative or greater than the maximum value of `int`.\n- The assertion `sn == -1` is guarded by the condition `(sn != x)`.

However, we can say that `sn` will always be greater than or equal to `x-1` because `sn` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. If `x` is incremented by 1 in the current iteration, then `sn` is equal to `x`. If `x` is not incremented by 1 in the current iteration, then `sn` is equal to `x-1`.\n- Since `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, it is always less than or equal to `sn+1`. \n\nFinal Assertion:\n- The final assertion is `sn != x` implies `sn == -1`. This means that if `sn` is not equal to `x`, then `sn` must be equal to `-1`. \n\nExplanation:\n- If `sn` is not equal to `x`, then the loop must have terminated early, which means that `sn` is less than `x`. Therefore, `sn` must be equal to `-1` to satisfy the assertion.",

Therefore, `sn` is always greater than or equal to `x`.\n- `sn <= x + 1` holds in every iteration of the loop because `sn` is incremented by 1 in every iteration while `x` is incremented by 1 in the loop body as well.
