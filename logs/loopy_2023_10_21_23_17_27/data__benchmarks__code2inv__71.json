We do not have any information about the behavior of this function, so we cannot make any assumptions about the number of iterations of the loop.\n\nLoop invariants:\n- Before the loop execution, the values of `c` and `z` satisfy the following:\n    - `c` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 36.\n    - `z` is greater than or equal to 36 times the value of `y` and less than or equal to 36 times the value of `y` plus 36.\n- In every iteration of the loop, the values of `c` and `z` satisfy the following:\n    - If the condition `(c < 36)` is true, then `c` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than 36, and `z` is greater than or equal to 36 times the value of `y` plus `c` and less than or equal to 36 times the value of `y` plus 36.\n    - If the condition `(c < 36)` is false, then `c` is greater than or equal to 36, and `z` is greater than or equal to 36 times the value of `y` plus 36 and less than or equal to 36 times the value of `y` plus 36.\n- After the loop termination, the values of `c` and `z` satisfy the following:\n    - If the condition `(c < 36)` is true, then `c` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than 36, and `z` is greater than or equal to 36 times the value of `y` plus `c` and less than or equal to 36 times the value of `y` plus 36. Therefore, `z` is greater than or equal to 36 times the value of `y`.\n    - If the condition `(c < 36)` is false, then `c` is greater than or equal to 36, and `z` is greater than or equal to 36 times the value of `y` plus 36 and less than or equal to 36 times the value of `y` plus 36. Therefore, `z` is greater than or equal to 36 times the value of `y`. \n\nPutting it all together, the loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@\n  loop invariant 0 <= c <= 36;\n  loop invariant 36 * y <= z <= 36 * y + 36;\n  loop invariant \\forall int i; 0 <= i < c ==> (36 * y + i) <= z <= 36 * y + 36;\n  loop invariant c >= 36 ==> z == 36 * y + 36;\n  loop invariant (c < 36) ==> (36 * y + c) <= z <= 36 * y + 36;\n  loop invariant (c >= 36) ==> 36 * y + 36 <= z <= 36 * y + 36;\n*/\n``` \n\nNote that we added a conjunction to the third loop invariant to specify the behavior of `z` when the condition `(c < 36)` is false. We also added implications to the fourth and fifth loop invariants to handle the cases where `c` is greater than or equal to 36. Finally, we used the pre-condition `(y >= 0)` to satisfy the lower bound of the second loop invariant.",

Since `y >= 127` and `c <= 36`, we have `36*y + c <= 36*127 + 36 = 4608`, which is an upper bound on `z`. Similarly, `36*y` is a lower bound on `z`.\n- Since there are no non-deterministic variables in the loop, we don't need to use any implication to make the loop invariants true at any point.\n- The post-condition `if (c < 36) { z >= 0; }` can be rewritten as `(c >= 36) ==> \\true || (c < 36) ==> z >= 0`.

We also know that `z` is assigned the value of `36 * y`, and that `c` is initialized to 0.\n- In every iteration of the loop, `c` is incremented by 1 if it is less than 36, and `z` is incremented by 1 as well. Therefore, we can say that `0 <= c <= 36` and `z == 36 * y + c`.\n- After the loop termination, if `c` is less than 36, then `z` must be greater than or equal to `36 * y` (because `z` is incremented by at most 36 times), which implies that `z >= 0`. Therefore, we can write the implication `(c >= 36) ==> (z >= 0)`.\n\nNote that we do not need to add any bounds on the variables `y` and `c` because they are already bounded by the conditions in the loop. Also, we do not need to add any implication for non-deterministic variables because there are none in this program.",
