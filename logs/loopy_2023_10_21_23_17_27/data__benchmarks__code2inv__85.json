This invariant holds before the loop starts because x is initialized to -15000 which is less than 0, and every time x is updated, it only gets bigger or stays the same.\n- The second loop invariant for variable y states that y is always greater than or equal to 0. This invariant holds before the loop starts because y is not assigned any value initially, and every time y is updated, it only gets bigger or stays the same.\n- The third loop invariant for variable y states that y is always less than or equal to x+15000. This invariant holds before the loop starts because x is initialized to -15000 which is less than 0, and every time x and y are updated, the value of y is incremented by at least 1, and the value of x is incremented by at least y, so the sum x+y is always increasing, and it can never exceed 15000.\n- The remaining loop invariants for variables z1, z2, and z3 are trivially true because these variables are not used in the loop body.\n- The loop assigns clause lists all the variables that are modified inside the loop. This is necessary to ensure that the loop invariants are preserved across loop iterations.\n- Inside the outer loop, there is an inner loop that increments the value of y until it becomes 0. The loop invariants for the inner loop are similar to those for the outer loop, except that the upper bound on y is updated to \\old(y)+\\old(x)+15001, because y can take on any value between 1 and \\old(y) inclusive, and x can take on any value between \\old(x) and x+y inclusive.\n- The implication in the assertion after the inner loop termination ensures that if y becomes 0, then x must be greater than or equal to 0.\n- The assertion after the outer loop termination ensures that y is greater than 0. This assertion holds because y is incremented"
