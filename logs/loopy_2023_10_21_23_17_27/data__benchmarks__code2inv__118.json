Therefore, `sn` is always greater than or equal to 0. Also, `i` is initialized to 1 and incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.

Therefore, `sn` is always greater than or equal to 0. Also, `i` is initialized to 1 and incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. Therefore, `i - 1` is the number of times the loop has executed so far. Since `sn` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, `sn` must be less than or equal to `i - 1`. Hence, `0 <= sn <= i - 1`.\n- `(i <= size) ==> (sn <= size)`\n  - Explanation: The loop continues executing as long as `i <= size`. Therefore, if `i <= size` is true, then `sn` must be less than or equal to `size` because `sn` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. Hence, `(i <= size) ==> (sn <= size)`.\n- `(i > size) ==> (sn == size)`\n  - Explanation: When the loop terminates, `i` is greater than `size`. Therefore, if `i > size` is true, then the loop has executed exactly `size` times because `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. Therefore, `sn` must be equal to `size` because `sn` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. Hence, `(i > size) ==> (sn == size)`.\n- `(sn != size) ==> (sn == 0)`\n  - Explanation: If `sn` is not equal to `size`, then the loop must have terminated early. Therefore, `i` must be greater than `size` and `sn` must be less than `size`. Hence, `sn` must be equal to 0. Therefore, `(sn != size) ==> (sn == 0)`.",

Therefore, `sn` is always greater than or equal to 0. Also, `i` is initialized to 1 and incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. Therefore, `i - 1` is the number of times the loop has executed so far. Since `sn` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, `sn` must be less than or equal to `i - 1`. Hence, `0 <= sn <= i - 1`.\n- `(i <= size) ==> (sn <= size)`\n  - Explanation: The loop continues executing as long as `i <= size`. Therefore, if `i <= size` is true, then `sn` must be less than or equal to `size` because `sn` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. Hence, `(i <= size) ==> (sn <= size)`.\n- `(i > size) ==> (sn == size)`\n  - Explanation: When the loop terminates, `i` is greater than `size`. Therefore, if `i > size` is true, then the loop has executed exactly `size` times because `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. Therefore, `sn` must be equal to `size` because `sn` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. Hence, `(i > size) ==> (sn == size)`.\n- `(sn != size) ==> (sn == 0)`\n  - Explanation: If `sn` is not equal to `size`, then the loop must have terminated early. Therefore, `i` must be greater than `size` and `sn` must be less than `size`. Hence, `sn` must be equal to 0. Therefore, `(sn != size) ==> (sn == 0)`.",
