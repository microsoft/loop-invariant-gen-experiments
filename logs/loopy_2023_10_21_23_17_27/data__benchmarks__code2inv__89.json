Since `lock` is assigned the value 1 at the beginning of the program and is not modified anywhere else, it will always remain 1.\n- `x == y ==> lock == 1`: If `x` is ever equal to `y`, then `lock` must be equal to 1, since that is the only value `lock` can be assigned to in the loop.\n- `v1 <= y`, `v2 <= x`, `v3 <= y`: These inequalities define the lower bounds for `v1`, `v2`, and `v3`, respectively. Since `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` are not assigned any values in the program, their initial values are unknown and can be any value. Therefore, we need to add these inequalities to ensure that the loop invariants hold for any possible value of these variables.\n- `y <= v3 + 1`: This inequality defines the upper bound for `y`. Since `y` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, its maximum value is `v3 + 1`.\n- `x <= v2`, `y <= v1`: These inequalities define the upper bounds for `x` and `y`, respectively.

Similarly, since `y` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, its value can never be greater than `v1`.\n- `x == y ==> v1 == v3`: If `x` is equal to `y`, then `v1` must be equal to `v3`.

This is important because `v3` and `v2` are assigned the value of `y` in the else branch of the conditional statement, and their values must be less than or equal to `y`.",

If it is false, the program returns 0.\n- The `unknown` function returns a non-deterministic integer value.\n\n**Loop Condition:**\n\n- The loop continues as long as `x` is not equal to `y`.\n\n**Post-condition:**\n\n- `(lock == 1)`.\n\n**Loop Invariants:**\n\n- Since `lock` is assigned the value of 1 before the loop, we can add the following invariant before the loop execution:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant lock == 1;\n*/\n```\n- Since `x` is assigned the value of `y` before the loop, we can add the following invariant before the loop execution:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x == y;\n*/\n```\n- Since the loop condition is `(x != y)`, we can add the following invariant in every iteration of the loop:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x != y ==> lock == 0 && y > \\at(y, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant x == y ==> lock == 1;\n*/\n```\n- The above invariants state that if `x` is not equal to `y`, then `lock` is equal to 0 and `y` is greater than its value at the loop entry. If `x` is equal to `y`, then `lock` is equal to 1.\n- Finally, since the post-condition is `(lock == 1)`, we can add the following invariant after the loop termination:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant lock == 1;\n*/\n```\n- Since all variables are non-deterministic at the beginning of the loop and the post-condition is guarded by no condition, we don't need to add any implication for these cases.\n\nTherefore, the complete set of loop invariants for the given program is:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant lock == 1;\n    loop invariant x == y;\n    loop invariant x != y ==> lock == 0 && y > \\at(y, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant x == y ==> lock == 1;\n    loop invariant lock == 1;\n*/\n```",

Therefore, if the loop terminates, we must have `x == y`.\n- After the first execution of the loop body, `x` is assigned the value of `y`. Therefore, `x` is either equal to `y` or less than `y`.\n- If `unknown()` returns true, then `lock` is assigned the value 1 and `x` is assigned the value of `y`. Therefore, `lock` is 1 and `x` is equal to `y`.\n- If `unknown()` returns false, then `lock` is assigned the value 0, `x` is assigned the value of `y` and `y` is incremented by 1.

Therefore, we add the invariants `lock == 1 ==> x == y` and `lock == 1 ==> x <= y`.\n- After loop termination, the lock variable is still 1, which means that the critical section is not released.

Since `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` are not assigned any values in the program, their initial values are unknown and can be any value. Therefore, we need to add these inequalities to ensure that the loop invariants hold for any possible value of these variables.\n- `y <= v3 + 1`: This inequality defines the upper bound for `y`. Since `y` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, its maximum value is `v3 + 1`.\n- `x <= v2`, `y <= v1`: These inequalities define the upper bounds for `x` and `y`, respectively. Since `x` is assigned the value of `y` in each iteration of the loop, its value can never be greater than `y`. Similarly, since `y` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, its value can never be greater than `v1`.\n- `x == y ==> v1 == v3`: If `x` is equal to `y`, then `v1` must be equal to `v3`.

This is because `v1` is assigned the value of `y` at the end of the loop, while `v2` is assigned the value of `y` in the else branch of the conditional statement.\n- `v1 <= y ==> v3 <= y`, `v1 <= y ==> v2 <= y`: These inequalities ensure that `v3` and `v2` are always less than or equal to `y` when `v1` is less than or equal to `y`. This is important because `v3` and `v2` are assigned the value of `y` in the else branch of the conditional statement, and their values must be less than or equal to `y`."

Since `lock` is assigned the value 1 at the beginning of the program and is not modified anywhere else, it will always remain 1.\n- `x == y ==> lock == 1`: If `x` is ever equal to `y`, then `lock` must be equal to 1, since that is the only value `lock` can be assigned to in the loop.\n- `v1 <= y`, `v2 <= x`, `v3 <= y`: These inequalities define the lower bounds for `v1`, `v2`, and `v3`, respectively. Since `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` are not assigned any values in the program, their initial values are unknown and can be any value. Therefore, we need to add these inequalities to ensure that the loop invariants hold for any possible value of these variables.\n- `y <= v3 + 1`: This inequality defines the upper bound for `y`. Since `y` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, its maximum value is `v3 + 1`.\n- `x <= v2`, `y <= v1`: These inequalities define the upper bounds for `x` and `y`, respectively. Since `x` is assigned the value of `y` in each iteration of the loop, its value can never be greater than `y`. Similarly, since `y` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, its value can never be greater than `v1`.\n- `x == y ==> v1 == v3`: If `x` is equal to `y`, then `v1` must be equal to `v3`. This is because `v1` is assigned the value of `y` at the end of the loop, while `v3` is assigned the value of `y` in the else branch of the conditional statement.\n- `y > x ==> v1 == v2`: If `y` is greater than `x`, then `v1` must be equal to `v2`. This is because `v1` is assigned the value of `y` at the end of the loop, while `v2` is assigned the value of `y` in the else branch of the conditional statement.\n- `v1 <= y ==> v3 <= y`, `v1 <= y ==> v2 <= y`: These inequalities ensure that `v3` and `v2` are always less than or equal to `y` when `v1` is less than or equal to `y`. This is important because `v3` and `v2` are assigned the value of `y` in the else branch of the conditional statement, and their values must be less than or equal to `y`.",

Since `lock` is assigned the value 1 at the beginning of the program and is not modified anywhere else, it will always remain 1.\n- `x == y ==> lock == 1`: If `x` is ever equal to `y`, then `lock` must be equal to 1, since that is the only value `lock` can be assigned to in the loop.\n- `v1 <= y`, `v2 <= x`, `v3 <= y`: These inequalities define the lower bounds for `v1`, `v2`, and `v3`, respectively. Since `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` are not assigned any values in the program, their initial values are unknown and can be any value. Therefore, we need to add these inequalities to ensure that the loop invariants hold for any possible value of these variables.\n- `y <= v3 + 1`: This inequality defines the upper bound for `y`. Since `y` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, its maximum value is `v3 + 1`.\n- `x <= v2`, `y <= v1`: These inequalities define the upper bounds for `x` and `y`, respectively. Since `x` is assigned the value of `y` in each iteration of the loop, its value can never be greater than `y`. Similarly, since `y` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, its value can never be greater than `v1`.\n- `x == y ==> v1 == v3`: If `x` is equal to `y`, then `v1` must be equal to `v3`. This is because `v1` is assigned the value of `y` at the end of the loop, while `v3` is assigned the value of `y` in the else branch of the conditional statement.\n- `y > x ==> v1 == v2`: If `y` is greater than `x`, then `v1` must be equal to `v2`. This is because `v1` is assigned the value of `y` at the end of the loop, while `v2` is assigned the value of `y` in the else branch of the conditional statement.\n- `v1 <= y ==> v3 <= y`, `v1 <= y ==> v2 <= y`: These inequalities ensure that `v3` and `v2` are always less than or equal to `y` when `v1` is less than or equal to `y`. This is important because `v3` and `v2` are assigned the value of `y` in the else branch of the conditional statement, and their values must be less than or equal to `y`.",
