Therefore, `x` remains greater than 0 throughout the loop.\n- Also, `x` is initialized with `n`. Therefore, `x` is always less than or equal to `n` throughout the loop.\n- After the loop terminates, `x` equals 1. Therefore, if `x` is not equal to 1, then it must have been decreased below 1 at some point in the loop, which means that `n` must be negative. Hence, the post-condition is satisfied.",
