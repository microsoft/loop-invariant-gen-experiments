We can use implications to express their behavior.\n- The variable `c` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts, and we don't know anything about its value after the loop terminates.

This is because in the loop body, if `unknown()` returns true and `c` is not already equal to 40, it gets incremented by 1. So all values of `c` up to the current value must have been incremented by 1 at some point, and since `c` is not yet equal to 40, they must have been 39 before the increment. Therefore, all values of `i` up to `c` must be 40.\n- The third invariant says that all values of `i` between `c` and 40 (exclusive) must be equal to 0. This is because in the loop body, if `unknown()` returns false and `c` is already equal to 40, it gets reset to 1. So all values of `c` from the current value up to 40 (exclusive) must have been reset to 1 at some point, and since `c` is already equal to 40, they must have been 0 before the reset. Therefore, all values of `i` between `c` and 40 (exclusive) must be 0.\n\nFinally, we can use an implication to make the post-condition trivially true if `unknown()` returns 0:\n\n```\nif ( (c != 40) )\n{\n  assume(unknown());\n  //@ assert( (c <= 40) );\n}\n```\n\nNote that we used the `assume()` macro to short-circuit the program and return 0 if the assumption is false.

Thus, we can add the following invariant:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant c >= 0; */\n```\n- The maximum value of `c` is 40, which is the condition for termination of the loop. Thus, we can add the following invariant:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant c <= 40; */\n```\n- Inside the loop, `c` is either incremented or reset to 1, but it can never be set to a value larger than 40. Thus, we can add the following invariant:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant c <= 40; */\n```\n- If the condition `(c != 40)` is true at the end of the loop, then the assertion `(c <= 40)` must hold.
