This is because in the loop body, `c` can only be incremented by 1, so it can never exceed `n + 1`.\n- `c > 0 ==> c <= n`: If `c` is greater than 0, then it must be less than or equal to `n`.

So, if `c` is greater than 0, it must be less than or equal to `n`.\n- `c == 1 ==> n >= 1`: If `c` is equal to 1, then `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. This is because in the loop body, if `c` is equal to `n`, it is set to 1. So, if `c` is 1, `n` must be at least 1 to avoid an infinite loop.\n- `n > 0`: The value of `n` must be greater than 0, as specified in the pre-conditions.\n\nWe can check that these loop invariants imply the post-condition `c >= 0`.

Hence, `c'` (the value of `c` in the next iteration) will be equal to `c + 1`.\n    - If `c` is less than or equal to `n`, then `c` will not be changed in the next iteration. Hence, `c'` will be equal to `c`.\n- After the loop, if `c` is not equal to `n`, then `c` must be greater than or equal to 1.
