Loop body:\nThe loop body consists of two if-else statements. The first if statement checks if `x < 10000000`, and if it is true, it increments `x` by 1. The else statement is executed when `x >= 10000000`, and it increments `x` by 2.\n4.

However, it includes the upper bound of `x`, which is 100000000.

The loop condition is `x < 100000000`.\n\nBefore the loop execution, we have `x = 0`. After the loop termination, we have `x = 100000001`.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body. We have two cases:\n\n1. `x < 10000000`: In this case, we have `x++`, which means `x` is incremented by 1.\n2. `x >= 10000000`: In this case, we have `x += 2`, which means `x` is incremented by 2.\n\nNow, let's identify the loop invariants that are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\n1. Before the loop execution, we have `x = 0`. This is a loop invariant because `x` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, we have `x < 100000000`. This is a loop invariant because the loop condition is `x < 100000000`, and we have `x++` or `x += 2` in the loop body.\n3. After the loop termination, we have `x = 100000001`. This is a loop invariant because the loop condition is `x < 100000000`, and we have `x++` or `x += 2` in the loop body.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the while loop in the program are:\n\n1. `x = 0`\n2. `x < 100000000`\n3. `x = 100000001`\n\nLet's output these loop invariants in one code block:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x = 0;\n    loop invariant x < 100000000;\n    loop invariant x = 100000001;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used the `loop invariant` keyword to indicate that these are loop invariants, and we have used the `=` operator to specify the invariant condition."
