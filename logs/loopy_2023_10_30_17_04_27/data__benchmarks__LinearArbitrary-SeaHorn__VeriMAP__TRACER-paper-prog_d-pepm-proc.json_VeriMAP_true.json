                "content": " The program has a loop that increments `y` and `x` by 1 in each iteration, as long as `x` is less than 10000. The loop invariant for this loop is:\n\n* The loop invariant is that `y` and `x` are both less than or equal to 10000.\n\nThis loop invariant is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. It implies that the post-condition `y + x < 10000` is true, which is the desired property to be verified by Frama-C.\n\nNote that the loop invariant is a conjunction of two conditions: `y <= 10000` and `x <= 10000`. We can split this conjunction into its parts and write the loop invariant as:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant y <= 10000;\n    loop invariant x <= 10000;\n*/\n```\nIt is important to note that we have made no assumptions about the behavior of the `unknown_uint()` function, which is called in the `assume(y>=0)` statement. We have simply assumed that it returns a value greater than or equal to 0, which is necessary to ensure that the loop invariant is true before the loop execution."

Pre-conditions:\n\t* `y >= 0` (assumed by the `assume` statement)\n\t* `x = 0` (initialized before the loop)\n2. Loop condition:\n\t* `x < 10000` (the loop continues while this condition is true)\n3.

Loop invariant before the loop:\n\t* `y >= 0` (pre-condition)\n\t* `x = 0` (initialized before the loop)\n2. Loop invariant in every iteration of the loop:\n\t* `y >= 0` (pre-condition)\n\t* `x < 10000` (loop condition)\n\t* `y + x < 10000` (post-condition)\n3.
