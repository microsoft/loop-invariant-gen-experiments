The first expression, `len - i`, is positive as long as `i < len`, which is exactly the loop condition. This expression decreases with each iteration since `i` is incremented by 1 in each step.\n\n2. The second expression, `USHRT_MAX - s`, is positive as long as `s` is less than `USHRT_MAX`. Since `s` is an unsigned short, it can never exceed `USHRT_MAX`. When `s` reaches `USHRT_MAX`, it wraps around to 0, and the expression becomes positive again. However, this wraparound can happen at most once because the loop will terminate when `i` becomes equal to `len`.\n\nSince both expressions are positive and decrease with each iteration (either `len - i` decreases, or it stays the same and `USHRT_MAX - s` decreases), this is a valid lexicographic ranking function for the loop, proving that the loop must terminate.",

The value of the ranking function `(len - i)` is positive for the loop to continue executing because `i < len`.\n\n2. The value of the ranking function decreases with every successive iteration of the loop.
