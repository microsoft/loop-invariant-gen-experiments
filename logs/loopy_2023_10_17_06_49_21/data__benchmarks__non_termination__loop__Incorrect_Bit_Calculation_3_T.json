The `mask` is a constant value that has the first 26 bits set to 1.\n\nThe right shift operation divides the value of `wc` by 2^6 (64), and the bitwise AND operation with `mask` ensures that the result is always a positive integer less than 2^26.

Thus, we can use the value of `wc` as the ranking function.\n\nThe ranking function for the given loop is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant wc;\n*/\n```\n\nThis is a valid ranking function because the value of `wc` is always positive and decreases in each iteration of the loop.

The bitwise AND operation with `mask` ensures that only the 26 least significant bits of `wc` are considered.\n\nNow, let's find the ranking function for the loop. The ranking function should be an expression that decreases with every iteration of the loop and should be positive for the loop to continue executing.
