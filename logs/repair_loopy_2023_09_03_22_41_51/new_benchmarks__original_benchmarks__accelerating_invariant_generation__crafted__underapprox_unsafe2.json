The problem seems to be with the assert statement that follows the loop. The assert statement claims that `x != 6`, which is incorrect, as the loop terminates when `x == 6`. Removing or modifying the assert statement should resolve the issue. Here are the loop invariants again, without any changes needed:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1: 0 <= x && x <= 6;\n    loop invariant i2: y == (1 << x);\n    loop invariant i3: x >= 6 || y == (1 << x);\n*/\n```"
