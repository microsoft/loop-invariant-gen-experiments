The program then assumes that `n` is greater than or equal to 0. \n\nThe while loop condition is `(x < n)`. Inside the loop, `x` is incremented by 1. The loop continues until `x` is no longer less than `n`. Finally, the program asserts that `x` is equal to `n`.\n\nWe can now derive the necessary loop invariants. \n\nBefore the loop execution:\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant n >= 0;\n  loop invariant x == 0 ==> n >= 0;\n*/\n```\nThe first loop invariant states that `n` is always greater than or equal to 0. This is based on the assumption made at the beginning of the program. \n\nThe second loop invariant states that if `x` is equal to 0, then `n` must be greater than or equal to 0. This is because `x` is assigned 0 before the loop, so if `n` is less than 0, then the loop condition will never be true, and the loop will not execute at all. \n\nIn every iteration of the loop:\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant n >= 0;\n  loop invariant x >= 0;\n  loop invariant x <= n;\n*/\n```\nThe first loop invariant is the same as before. \n\nThe second loop invariant states that `x` is always greater than or equal to 0. This is because `x` is incremented by 1 each time the loop executes, and it starts at 0.\n\nThe third loop invariant states that `x` is always less than or equal to `n`. This is because the loop condition is `(x < n)`, so once `x` is equal to `n`, the loop will terminate.\n\nAfter the loop termination:\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant n >= 0;\n  loop invariant x == n;\n  loop invariant x >= 0;\n  loop invariant x <= n;\n*/\n```\nThe first loop invariant is the same as before. \n\nThe second loop invariant states that `x` is equal to `n` after the loop terminates. This is based on the assertion made at the end of the program.\n\nThe third and fourth loop invariants are the same as before. \n\nPutting all the loop invariants together, we get:\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant n >= 0;\n  loop invariant x == 0 ==> n >= 0;\n  loop invariant x >= 0;\n  loop invariant x <= n;\n  loop invariant x == n ==> \\true;\n*/\n``` \n\nNote that the last loop invariant is an implication. It is necessary because the assertion at the end of the program is guarded by a condition. If `x` is not equal to `n`, then the assertion does not need to hold, so the invariant is trivially true."
