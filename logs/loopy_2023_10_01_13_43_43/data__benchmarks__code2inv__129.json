(x = 2^n, where n is a non-negative integer and x <= y)\n- After the loop termination, x is greater than or equal to y. (x >= y)\n\nExplanation:\n- Before the loop execution, x is assigned the value 1, so it is greater than or equal to 1. (x >= 1)\n- In every iteration of the loop, x is doubled (x = x + x), so it is always a power of 2. Also, since the loop condition is x < y, x can never exceed y. Therefore, x is always less than or equal to y. (x = 2^n, where n is a non-negative integer and x <= y)\n- After the loop termination, x is either equal to y (if y is a power of 2 and x reaches that value) or greater than y (if x exceeds y before reaching a power of 2). Therefore, x is greater than or equal to y. (x >= y)\n\nLoop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 1;\n    loop invariant x == 2^n && x <= y;\n    loop invariant x >= y ==> x >= 1;\n*/\n```"
