Also, the loop condition `x < y` implies that `y` is greater than `x`, so we don't need to add any additional constraints on `y`.\n- After the loop termination, we know that `x` is no longer less than `y`, so we have `x >= y`. Also, since `x` is doubled in each iteration, it is the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to the initial value of `x`. This means that `x` can be expressed as `2^n` for some integer `n`. Therefore, we have `x >= 2^(n-1) >= 1` which simplifies to `x >= 1`. \n\nPutting it all together:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 1;\n    loop invariant x < y ==> x >= 1;\n    loop invariant x < y;\n    loop invariant y >= \\old(y);\n    loop invariant x == 2^n ==> x >= \\old(x);\n    loop invariant x >= y ==> x >= 2^(n-1);\n*/\n```"
