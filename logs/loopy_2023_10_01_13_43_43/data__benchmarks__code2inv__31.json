The sum of `v1`, `v2` and `v3` represents the number of iterations executed so far. If `x` is less than or equal to `n`, then the number of iterations left is `n-x+1`. If `x` is greater than `n`, then there are no iterations left and the sum of `v1`, `v2` and `v3` should be zero.\n- The post-condition of the program is `x != 1 ==> n < 0`. We can use implication to include the guard condition `x != 1` in the loop invariant. But since `x` is uninitialized, we cannot use it in the loop invariant. Instead, we can use `x <= 1` to represent the negation of `x != 1`. Thus, we can add the following loop invariant:\n```\n//@ loop invariant x <= 1 ==> n < 0;\n```\n- Since `n` is uninitialized, we cannot bound its maximum or minimum values. Similarly, since `x` is uninitialized at the beginning and end of the loop, we can use implication to make the other loop invariants trivially true at these locations."
