For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values. Do not use variables that have garbage values.**\n- **Do not use keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops.**\n- **Variables that are not explicitly initialized, could have garbage values.

This means that `y` is incremented by `1` and assigned to `y`, and `x` is assigned the current value of `y`. Therefore, `(lock == 0) ==> (x < y)` is true. Also, since `y` is incremented by `1`, `y` is greater than its previous value, i.e., `y > \\at(y, Pre)`.

Therefore, this is true before, during and after the loop execution.\n- `(x <= y)`: This is true before the loop execution since `x` and `y` are initially equal. In every iteration of the loop, `x` is assigned the value of `y`, so `x` becomes less than or equal to `y`. This is also true after the loop termination since `x` is equal to `y`.\n- `(y <= \\max_int)`: This is true before the loop execution since `y` is an uninitialized variable and can take any value less than or equal to the maximum value of an integer. In every iteration of the loop, `y` is assigned a value that is either equal to `\\old(y)` or `\\old(y) + 1`, both of which are less than or equal to the maximum value of an integer. This is also true after the loop termination since `y` is equal to `x` which has the same value as `y` before the loop termination.\n- `(x >= \\min_int)`: This is true before the loop execution since `x` is an uninitialized variable and can take any value greater than or equal to the minimum value of an integer. In every iteration of the loop, `x` is assigned the value of `y`, which is greater than or equal to the minimum value of an integer. This is also true after the loop termination since `x` is equal to `y`.\n- `(y >= \\min_int)`: This is true before the loop execution since `y` is an uninitialized variable and can take any value greater than or equal to the minimum value of an integer. In every iteration of the loop, `y` is assigned a value that is either equal to `\\old(y)` or `\\old(y) + 1`, both of which are greater than or equal to the minimum value of an integer. This is also true after the loop termination since `y` is equal to `x` which has the same value as `y` before the loop termination.\n- If `unknown()` returns true, then `(x == y)`: This is true in every iteration of the loop because if `unknown()` returns true, then `x` is assigned the value of `y`, making `x` equal to `y`.\n- If `unknown()` returns false, then `(y == \\old(y) + 1)`: This is true in every iteration of the loop because if `unknown()` returns false, then `y` is assigned the value of `\\old(y) + 1`, making `y` greater than `\\old(y)`.\n- `(x == y) ==> (lock == 1)`: This is the post-condition that we need to verify. This is true after the loop termination because if `x` is equal to `y`, then the loop condition `(x != y)` is false, and the loop body is not executed. Therefore, `lock` retains its value of 1 that was assigned before the loop execution."
