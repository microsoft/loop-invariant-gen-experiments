So, `x == n` is a loop invariant that holds before the loop execution.\n```\n/*@ loop invariant x == n; */\n```\n\n- In every iteration of the loop, `x` decreases by 1. So, if `x > 1` is true at the beginning of an iteration, then `x - 1 > 0` must be true at the end of the iteration. Thus, `x > 1` implies `x - 1 > 0`. \n\n- Also, since `x` is initialized to `n`, we have `n > 1` as a necessary loop invariant to ensure that the loop executes at least once. \n\n- Therefore, the conjunction of these two invariants, `n > 1 && x > 1 ==> x - 1 > 0`, holds in every iteration of the loop. \n```\n/*@ loop invariant x == n;\n    loop invariant n > 1 && x > 1 ==> x - 1 > 0; */\n```\n\n- After the loop termination, we know that `x <= 1`. If `n >= 0` is true, then `x == 1` must be true to satisfy the post-condition. So, `n >= 0 && x <= 1` implies `x == 1`. \n```\n/*@ loop invariant x == n;\n    loop invariant n > 1 && x > 1 ==> x - 1 > 0;\n    loop invariant n >= 0 && x <= 1 ==> x == 1; */\n```\n\nIn addition, we can add the following bounds on `n` and `x`:\n\n- Since `n` is an integer, it can take any value between the minimum and maximum value of an integer. So, we have `INT_MIN <= n <= INT_MAX`.\n\n- Since `x` is initialized to `n` and decreases by 1 in each iteration of the loop, its maximum value is `n` and its minimum value is 1. So, we have `1 <= x <= n`.\n\nFinally, we get the complete loop invariants as follows:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant INT_MIN <= n <= INT_MAX;\n    loop invariant 1 <= x <= n;\n    loop invariant x == n;\n    loop invariant n > 1 && x > 1 ==> x - 1 > 0;\n    loop invariant n >= 0 && x <= 1 ==> x == 1; */\n```"
