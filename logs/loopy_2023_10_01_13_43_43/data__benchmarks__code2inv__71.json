Therefore, `z >= 36 * y`.\n- `c` is initialized to 0 before the loop execution. Therefore, `c <= 36`.\n- In every iteration of the loop, if `c < 36`, then `z` is incremented by 1, and `c` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `z >= 36 * y + c`.\n- After the loop termination, if `(c < 36)` then the loop has not executed 36 times, and `z` is less than `36 * y + 36`. Therefore, `(z >= 36 * y + c) ==> (z >= 0)`.\n\nNote:\n- Since `unknown()` is a non-deterministic function call, we cannot make any assumptions about the number of times the loop will execute. Therefore, we cannot add any loop invariant that depends on the number of iterations of the loop.",
