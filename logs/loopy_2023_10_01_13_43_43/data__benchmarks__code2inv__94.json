Based on this, we can add the following invariants that are true in every iteration of the loop:\n- i >= 0\n- j >= 0\n- i <= n+1\n- j <= (n+1)*(n+2)/2\n\nNow, let's focus on the post-condition:\n```\n((i + (j + k)) > (2 * n))\n```\nSince the assertion is not guarded by any condition, we can use it directly as the loop invariant that is true after the loop termination.

Thus, i == n+1 is true after the loop terminates.\n    - The final value of j is the sum of the first n+1 natural numbers. Therefore, j equals (n+1)*(n+2)/2 after the loop terminates.\n    - The assertion is guarded by the condition (i + j + k) > 2*n. Therefore, we use implication to make the invariant trivially true when the condition is false. The implication is that if (i + j + k) <= 2*n, then the assertion holds. To prove this, we can use the fact that i and j are increasing in each iteration of the loop, so the maximum value of (i + j + k) is (n+1)*(n+2)/2 + k, which is greater than 2*n when k > n+2. Therefore, the implication is true for all values of k >= n+3."
