Since `x` is decremented by 1 in every iteration, the following invariant holds true:\n```\n/*@\nloop invariant 0 <= x <= 100;\nloop invariant \\forall integer i; 0 <= i < (100 - x) ==> i < 100;\n*/\n```\nExplanation: The first invariant is the same as before. The second invariant states that for all integers `i` between 0 and `100-x`, `i` is less than 100. Since `x` is decremented by 1 in every iteration, the value of `100-x` decreases by 1 in every iteration. Therefore, the second invariant is true in every iteration.\n\nFinally, let's find an invariant that holds true after the loop termination and implies the post condition. Since the loop terminates when `x` is 0, the following invariant holds true after the loop termination:\n```\n/*@\nloop invariant 0 <= x <= 100;\nloop invariant \\forall integer i; 0 <= i < (100 - x) ==> i < 100;\nloop invariant x == 0 ==> \\true;\n*/\n```\nExplanation: The first two invariants are the same as before. The third invariant states that if `x` is 0, then the invariant is trivially true. This implies that the post condition `(x == 0)` is true when the loop terminates.\n\nPutting it all together, the loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@\nloop invariant 0 <= x <= 100;\nloop invariant \\forall integer i; 0 <= i < (100 - x) ==> i < 100;\nloop invariant x == 0 ==> \\true;\n*/\n```\nThese loop invariants are sufficient to verify that the post condition `(x == 0)` is true after the loop terminates."
