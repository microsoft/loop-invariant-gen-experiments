If `unknown()` returns a zero value, then either `c` is reset to 1 if it is equal to `n`, or it is incremented by 1 if it is not equal to `n`.\n- The third loop invariant ensures that the post-condition is satisfied after the loop terminates. If `c` is not equal to `n`, then it must be greater than or equal to 0.",
