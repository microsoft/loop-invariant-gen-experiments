Thus, at the end of each iteration, `sn` is equal to the sum of the first `i-1` positive integers.\n- The fourth invariant is a bound on `n` because the loop condition requires that `i <= n`. \n\nUsing these loop invariants, we can prove that the post-condition `sn == 0` holds true. \n\nNote that since there are no non-deterministic variables or functions, we don't need to add any implications to make the loop invariants true. \n\nTherefore, the loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i >= 1;\n    loop invariant sn >= 0;\n    loop invariant sn == i - 1;\n    loop invariant n >= 0;\n*/\n```"

Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, and the loop stops when `i` is greater than `n`, this invariant holds before and after the loop.\n- The second loop invariant ensures that `sn` is always equal to the sum of the numbers from 1 to `i-1`. This is true before the loop because `sn` is initially 0 and true in every iteration because `sn` is incremented by `i-1`. After the loop, this invariant implies the post-condition because if `sn` is not equal to `n`, then `i` must be greater than `n+1`, which contradicts the first loop invariant.

It also holds true in every iteration of the loop because `i` and `sn` are both incremented by 1 in each iteration, so their difference remains constant at 1. It also holds true after the loop termination because `i` is greater than `n`, so `i - sn` must be equal to `n - sn + 1`, but we know that `n - sn` is 0 (from the assertion), so `i - sn` must be 1.\n- The assertion is guarded by the condition `(sn != n)`. If this condition is true, then the implication `(sn != n) ==> (sn == 0)` is also true, so the assertion holds true.
