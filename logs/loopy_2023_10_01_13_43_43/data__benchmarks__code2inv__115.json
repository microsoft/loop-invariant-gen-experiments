This is because both `sn` and `x` are incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.\n- The `loop_counter` variable represents the number of iterations of the loop so far. Hence, the next loop invariant sets an upper bound on `loop_counter`.\n- The next three loop invariants handle the case where `sn` equals -1. Since `sn` is always non-negative, `sn` can only be equal to -1 if the loop has not executed at all. Hence, when `sn` equals -1, we set `x` and `loop_counter` to 0.\n- The last loop invariant relates the difference between `sn` and `x` to the number of iterations of the loop so far. This ensures that `sn` is always greater than or equal to `x`.\n- The last loop invariant sets an upper bound on the difference between `sn` and `x`. This ensures that the loop will terminate within a finite number of iterations.\n\nNote that we have used a constant `LOOP_BOUND` to set the upper bound on `sn` and `x`.

We can assume that `sn` and `x` will increment by 1 in each iteration of the loop, so after k iterations, `sn` will be equal to `x + k`.\n- After the loop termination, the post-condition specifies that `sn` must be equal to `x`. Since the loop invariant states that `sn` is always equal to `x + k`, we can substitute `x + k` for `sn` in the post-condition to get `(x + k == x)`, which simplifies to `k == -x`. This means that the loop must have executed `-x` times, which is equivalent to saying that `x` is equal to `k` after the loop terminates.
