Therefore, `x` can never be smaller than `-50`.\n- The second invariant `y >= 0` is true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop. This is because `y` is assigned the value `0` before the loop and is incremented by `1` in every iteration. Therefore, `y` can never be negative.\n- The third invariant `y > 0 ==> x > -50` is true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop. This is because if `y` is greater than `0`, then `x` must be greater than `-50` (since `x` is incremented by `y` in every iteration). This invariant implies the post-condition `(y > 0)`, because if `y` is greater than `0`, then `x` must be greater than `-50`, which means `y` must be greater than `50`. Therefore, the post-condition `(y > 0)` is satisfied. \n\nNote: Since all variables except `x` and `y` contain garbage values, we do not need to add any loop invariants for them. \n\nTherefore, the final set of loop invariants is:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= -50;\n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n    loop invariant y > 0 ==> x > -50;\n*/\n```"
