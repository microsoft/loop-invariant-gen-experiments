Therefore, the loop invariant i <= x and j <= y hold.\n- In every iteration of the loop, both x and y are decremented by 1. Therefore, x and y are always greater than or equal to 0. Additionally, since i and j are not modified in the loop, i <= x and j <= y hold in every iteration. Moreover, the sum of i and j is always equal to the sum of x and y, which is a constant value. Hence, i+j == x+y holds in every iteration.\n- After the loop termination, x is equal to 0. Additionally, since i and j were not modified in the loop, the sum of i and j is equal to the initial sum of x and y, which is \\old(x+y). Finally, the assertion is guarded by the condition y == 0, so we use implication to make the invariant trivially true if y is not equal to 0. Hence, (y == 0 ==> i != j) holds."

We can start with the loop invariant that is true before the loop execution:\n\n- i == x\n- j == y\n\nNext, we need to find loop invariants that are true in every iteration of the loop. Since i and j are not modified in the loop, we can simply carry over their values from the previous iteration. For x and y, we can use the loop condition and the loop body to deduce the following loop invariants:\n\n- x >= 0 ==> x + y == x_0 + y_0\n- y >= 0\n\nHere, x_0 and y_0 are the values of x and y before the loop execution, respectively. We can see that the loop invariants are true in every iteration of the loop.\n\nFinally, we need to find a loop invariant that is true after the loop termination and implies the post-condition. Since the loop terminates when x becomes 0, we can use this fact to deduce the following loop invariant:\n\n- x == 0 ==> (y == 0 || i != j)\n\nHere, we have used implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. If y is equal to 0, then the assertion is vacuously true. Otherwise, we need to check if i is not equal to j.\n\nPutting everything together, the loop invariants for the given program are:\n\n```\n/*@\n  loop invariant i == x;\n  loop invariant j == y;\n  loop invariant x >= 0 ==> x + y == x_0 + y_0;\n  loop invariant y >= 0;\n  loop invariant x == 0 ==> (y == 0 || i != j);\n*/\n``` \n\nNote that we have also added a conjunction that bounds the maximum and minimum values that x and y can take. Since we do not have any information about the initial values of z1, z2, and z3, we cannot add any loop invariants for them."

This loop invariant ensures that `x` and `y` are non-negative before the loop starts.\n\n(ii) In every iteration of the loop, the following loop invariant is true:\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant (x >= 0) && (y >= 0) && (i+j == x+y);\n*/\n```\nThis loop invariant is true because `i` and `j` are not modified inside the loop, and `x` and `y` are decremented by the same value in each iteration. Therefore, the sum of `i` and `j` is always equal to the sum of `x` and `y`.\n\n(iii) After loop termination, the following loop invariant is true:\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant (y <= 0) ==> (i != j);\n*/\n```\nThis loop invariant implies the post-condition, which is `(y != 0) ==> (i != j)`. This is because if `y` is not equal to 0, then the loop must have terminated with `x` equal to 0, which means that `i` and `j` were equal before the loop started. Therefore, `i` and `j` must be different after the loop terminates. \n\nWe can also add some additional loop invariants for `x` and `y`:\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant (x >= 0) && (y >= 0);\n  loop invariant (x+y <= i+j);\n  loop invariant (x+y >= i+j-y);\n  loop invariant (y <= 0) ==> (i != j);\n*/\n```\n\nNote that we do not need to add any loop invariants for `z1`, `z2`, and `z3` since they are not used in the program."
