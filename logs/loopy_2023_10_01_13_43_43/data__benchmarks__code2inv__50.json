If `c` is not equal to `4`, then we can safely increment `c`. Therefore, `(unknown() == 0) ==> (c != 4)`.\n    - If `unknown()` returns non-zero, then we know that either the if or else condition is true. If `c` is equal to `4`, then we need to reset it to `1`. Therefore, `(unknown() != 0) ==> (c >= 1 && c <= 4)`.\n- After the loop, we need to ensure that `c` satisfies certain conditions. If `unknown()` returns `0`, then we know that the loop has terminated and `c` should be equal to `4`.
