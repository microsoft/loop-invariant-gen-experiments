This is because x is initially assigned the value of n, and x is decremented in each iteration of the loop until it becomes 0. Hence, if n is negative, x will eventually become negative, which will violate the assertion. So, we add this implication as the loop invariant: x == 0 ==> n >= 0.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@\nloop invariant x >= 0;\nloop invariant x == 0 ==> n >= 0;\n*/\n```"
