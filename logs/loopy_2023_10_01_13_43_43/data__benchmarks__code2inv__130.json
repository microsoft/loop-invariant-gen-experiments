Similarly, `x3 >= 0` is also a loop invariant.\n- If `x1` and `x2` are both greater than 0, we know that `x3` is only modified if its previous value is greater than 0. Hence, `x3 >= 0` is a loop invariant whenever `x1 > 0 && x2 > 0`.\n- Since `x1` is decremented by `d1` in each iteration of the loop, we know that `x1` will eventually become negative if it starts at a value greater than or equal to `\\MAX_INT`. Therefore, `(x1 > 0 && x2 > 0 && x3 > 0) ==> (x1 < \\MAX_INT)` is a loop invariant.\n- Finally, we add a loop invariant that bounds all variables between 0 and `\\MAX_INT`.
