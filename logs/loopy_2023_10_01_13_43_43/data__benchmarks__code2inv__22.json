Otherwise, `m` remains the same, and `m` is less than or equal to its previous value `\\old(m)`. Hence, `m <= \\old(m) \\/ x == \\old(x)`.\n- After the loop termination, we need to show that if `m` is greater than or equal to 1, then `n` must be less than or equal to `m`.

If `x = n`, then `m` must be at least 1, since `m` is assigned the value of `x` when `unknown()` returns true, and `unknown()` may return true in any iteration of the loop. Therefore, `(x >= n) ==> (m >= 1)` holds.

Also, since m is assigned the value 1 at the beginning and is only updated if unknown() returns true, it follows that m is always greater than or equal to 1. \n\nNote: Since the value of unknown() is not known, we cannot make any assumptions about the value of m after the loop. However, we can ensure that m is greater than or equal to 1. Thus, the post-condition can be verified by the loop invariants.",
