This is because i is assigned the value of x and j is assigned the value of y.\n\nIn every iteration of the loop, we have `x >= 0` and `y >= 0`. This is because both x and y are decremented by 1 in each iteration, and their initial values are non-negative. Also, we have `i == x + (j - y)`. This is because i is not updated in the loop, and its initial value is x. Since j is not updated in the loop, the difference (j - y) is constant throughout the loop. Therefore, i is equal to the sum of x and a constant value (j - y) in every iteration of the loop.\n\nAfter the loop termination, we have `i == j ==> y == 0`. If i is equal to j, then (j - y) is equal to (i - x), and hence i is equal to x + (i - x), which simplifies to i. Therefore, we have `i == j ==> y == 0`. Note that if i is not equal to j, then the post-condition is vacuously true, because the assertion is guarded by the condition `(i == j)`. \n\nWe can write the loop invariants as follows:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i == x;\n    loop invariant j == y;\n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n    loop invariant i == x + (j - y);\n    loop invariant (i == j) ==> (y == 0);\n*/\n```"

Therefore, both `x` and `y` are greater than or equal to 0 in every iteration of the loop.\n- In every iteration of the loop, `i` and `j` are greater than or equal to `x` and `y`, respectively. This is because `i` and `j` are assigned the values of `x` and `y` before the loop execution and are not changed inside the loop.\n- In every iteration of the loop, if `i` and `j` are equal, then `y` is equal to the difference between `j` and `x`. This is because `i` and `j` are not changed inside the loop, and `y` is decremented by 1 in every iteration of the loop.\n- After the loop termination, if `i` and `j` are equal, then `y` is equal to 0. This is because `i` and `j` are not changed inside the loop, and `y` is decremented by 1 in every iteration of the loop until `x` becomes 0. Therefore, `y` must be 0 when the loop terminates.",
