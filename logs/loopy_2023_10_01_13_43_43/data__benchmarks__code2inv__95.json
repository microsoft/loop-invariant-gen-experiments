Therefore, after `n` iterations, `j` equals `1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n`, which is equal to `n*(n+1)/2`. So, during the loop, we have `i*(i+1)/2 = j`.\n- The loop continues while `i` is less than or equal to `x`. Therefore, after the loop terminates, we have either `i == x+1` or `i <= x`. If `y == 1`, then the assertion `i == j` should hold. If `y` is not equal to `1`, then the assertion may not hold, and Frama-C may issue a warning.\n\nTherefore, we can write the loop invariants as follows:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i >= 0;\n    loop invariant j == (i*(i+1))/2;\n    loop invariant i <= x + 1;\n    loop invariant y == 1 ==> i == j;\n*/\n```"
