We need to make sure that these bounds are maintained throughout the execution of the loop.\n- The loop condition is unknown(), which means that we don't know how many times the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to come up with loop invariants that hold regardless of the number of iterations.\n- The first two loop invariants state that x and y are always less than or equal to 4. Since x and y are incremented by 2 in each iteration, their maximum value can be 4. These invariants ensure that x and y don't exceed their maximum value.\n- The next two loop invariants state that x and y are always even. Since x and y are incremented by 2 in each iteration, they will always be even. These invariants ensure that x and y remain even throughout the loop.\n- The last loop invariant uses implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. If unknown() is true, then x and y are bounded by their initial values. Since x and y are incremented by 2 in each iteration, their value can be at most 2 more than their initial value. Therefore, if unknown() is true, then x <= 2 && y <= 2. This invariant ensures that x and y don't exceed their initial values if unknown() is true.\n- Since there are no non-deterministic variables in this program, we don't need to use any implications to make the loop invariants trivially true at the beginning or end of the loop.\n- Finally, the assertion is guarded by a condition (y == 0), so we need to use implication to take care of this. If y != 0, then the assertion is vacuously true and doesn't need to be verified. Therefore, we need to add the guard condition in an implication to make sure that the assertion is verified only when y == 0."

Therefore, `(x + y) % 2 == 0` is an invariant that holds true in every iteration of the loop.\n\nAfter the loop execution, we know that `y` is 0, which means `x` should not be 4.
