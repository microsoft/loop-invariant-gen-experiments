Therefore, i is always odd throughout the loop execution. Similarly, j is also odd throughout the loop execution. \n- Also, we can see that in each iteration, i is incremented by 2 and j is decremented by 1. Therefore, the difference between j and i is reduced by 3 in each iteration. Initially, j - i = 19, which is a multiple of 3. So, after each iteration, j - i will still be a multiple of 3. Hence, (j - i) % 3 == 0 is a loop invariant.\n- We can also observe that the maximum value that i can take is 21, which is the first odd number greater than 20. Hence, i <= 21 is a loop invariant.\n- Similarly, the minimum value that j can take is 12, which is the first odd number less than or equal to 13. Hence, j >= 12 is a loop invariant.\n- After the loop termination, we need to ensure that j is equal to 13. This can be achieved by adding an assertion (j == 13) after the loop. \n\nPutting it all together:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i % 2 == 1;\n    loop invariant j % 2 == 1;\n    loop invariant i <= 21;\n    loop invariant j >= 12;\n    loop invariant (j - i) % 3 == 0;\n*/\nwhile ((j >= i)) {\n    {\n    (i  = (i + 2));\n    (j  = (j - 1));\n    }\n\n}\nassume(j == 13);\n```"

Since `i` starts at 1 and is incremented by 2 in each iteration, and `j` starts at 20 and is decremented by 1 in each iteration, eventually `i` becomes greater than `j` and the loop terminates. Thus, when the loop terminates, `i` is greater than 21 and `j` is less than 11, which means that the last two loop invariants hold.\n- The post-condition is `j == 13`. Since `j` is odd and less than or equal to 20 at the beginning of the loop, and `j` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, `j` can only be equal to 13 when `i` is equal to 17.
