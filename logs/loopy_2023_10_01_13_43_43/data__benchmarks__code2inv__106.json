Therefore, `m >= a` holds in every iteration of the loop.\n- If the loop terminates, then `k >= 1`, and `m` is assigned the value of `a` whenever `a` is greater than `m`. Therefore, `m >= a` holds after the loop termination.\n- If the loop terminates, then `k >= 1`. Therefore, the assertion is executed at least once. If `a < m` holds when the assertion is executed, then the program terminates. Therefore, we can write the following implication:\n```\n(k >= 1 && a < m) ==> 0\n```\n- Combining all the loop invariants, we get:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant a <= m;\n    loop invariant j < 1;\n    loop invariant k == 0;\n    loop invariant k >= 0;\n    loop invariant m >= a;\n    loop invariant (k >= 1 && a < m) ==> 0;\n*/\n```"

If `m` is less than `a`, then `m` is assigned the value of `a`.\n- The loop condition is that `k` is less than 1.\n\nBased on these observations, we can come up with the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant k <= 1;\n    loop invariant k >= 0;\n    loop invariant j < 1;\n    loop invariant a <= m;\n    loop invariant \\forall integer i; 0 <= i < k ==> m >= a;\n*/\n```\nLet's break down these loop invariants:\n- `k <= 1` and `k >= 0` bound the maximum and minimum values that `k` can take. Since `k` is initialized to 0 and only incremented by 1 in each iteration, it can only be 0 or 1.\n- `j < 1` is a pre-condition that is also a loop invariant. It ensures that `j` is less than 1 at all times.\n- `a <= m` ensures that `m` is always greater than or equal to `a`.\n- `\\forall integer i; 0 <= i < k ==> m >= a` is the most important loop invariant that implies the post-condition. It states that for all values of `i` between 0 and `k-1`, inclusive, `m` is greater than or equal to `a`. This invariant holds true at the beginning of the loop since `k` is initialized to 0. In each iteration, the loop condition guarantees that `k` is less than 1. Therefore, `m` is greater than or equal to `a` after the loop terminates. This invariant guarantees that the assertion `a >= m` is true after the loop terminates.\n\nNote that we did not need to use implication since the loop body is not conditional on any variables.

The loop body contains an if-else statement that updates the value of `m` based on the value of `a`. Therefore, we can add the following loop invariant:\n\nLoop Invariant:\n- `m >= a`\n\nThis loop invariant holds before the loop since `a <= m` is a pre-condition. In every iteration of the loop, `m` is updated to `a` if `m < a`. Therefore, after the update, the loop invariant still holds. Once the loop terminates, the loop condition `k < 1` is false, which implies that `k >= 1`. Since `k` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, `k` is at least 1 after the loop. Therefore, the loop invariant also holds after the loop.\n\nNow, we can use this loop invariant to prove the post-condition. Since we know that `m >= a` is true at the end of the loop, we can use implication to prove the post-condition:\n\nLoop Invariant:\n- `m >= a`\n\nPost-condition:\n- `a >= m`\n\nLoop Invariant ==> Post-condition:\n- `m >= a ==> a >= m`\n\nTherefore, we can add the following loop invariants to the program:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant m >= a;\n    loop invariant k >= 0;\n*/\n```\n\nNote that we added the loop invariant `k >= 0` to ensure that `k` is non-negative throughout the loop.
