For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values. Do not use variables that have garbage values.**\n- **Do not use keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops.**\n- **Variables that are not explicitly initialized, could have garbage values.

This is because of the if-else conditions inside the loop. If the first condition is true, then c can only be incremented. If the second condition is true, then c can only be reset to 1. Hence, if c is between 0 and 4 (inclusive) before the loop, then it will be between 1 and 4 (inclusive) after each iteration.\n- After the loop termination:\n    - If c is less than 0, then it must have been reset to 1 at some point in the loop and then incremented 4 times. Hence, c should be 4.\n    - If c is greater than 4, then it must have been incremented 5 times at some point in the loop. Hence, c should be 4.\n\nNote:\n- Since there are non-deterministic function calls in the program, we cannot assume anything about the values of the variables at the beginning or end of the loop. Hence, we do not need to add any implications for non-deterministic variables.",
