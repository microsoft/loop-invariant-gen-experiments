Since `x` is assigned the value `10000` at the beginning, it must be between `0` and `10000`.\n- The second invariant is a conjunction that states that `x` is decremented by `1` in each iteration. It uses a quantifier to say that for all `i` between `0` and the number of iterations left until `x` becomes `0`, the value of `x` at the beginning of the loop is `10000`. This is because `x` is decremented by `1` in each iteration, so the number of iterations left is equal to `(10000 - x)`.\n- The third invariant is a conjunction that states that `x` is always non-negative.\n- The fourth invariant is an implication that says that if `x` is equal to `0` at the end of the loop, then it must have been `0` at the beginning of the loop. This is because `x` is only decremented in the loop, so if it becomes `0` at some point, it must have been `0` before that point.\n- The fifth invariant is an implication that says that if `x` is positive at the end of the loop, then it must have been positive at the beginning of the loop. This is because `x` is only decremented in the loop, so if it becomes non-positive at some point, it must have been non-positive before that point.\n- The sixth invariant is an implication that says that if `x` is non-positive at the end of the loop, then it must be equal to `0`. This is because `x` is only decremented in the loop, so if it becomes non-positive at some point, it must be equal to `0`."
