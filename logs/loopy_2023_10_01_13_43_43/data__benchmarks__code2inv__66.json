Since `x` is incremented by 1 in every iteration, `y` is decremented by 1 in every iteration. Hence, `y` is always equal to 100 minus the current value of `x`.\n- In every iteration of the loop, `x` is incremented by 1, so it is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 101.\n- After the loop termination, `x` is equal to 101.\n- After the loop termination, `y` is equal to 100 minus the final value of `x`, which is -1.\n\nUsing these loop invariants, we can prove that the assertion `y < 100` holds at the end of the program. Here's the code block with all the loop invariants:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant 1 <= x <= 101;\n    loop invariant y == 100 - x;\n    loop invariant \\forall integer i; 1 <= i < x ==> y < 100;\n    loop assigns x, y;\n*/\nwhile (x <= 100) {\n    y = 100 - x;\n    x = x +1;\n}\nassume(y < 100);\n``` \n\nNote that we used a universal quantifier to express that for all `i` from 1 to `x-1`, `y` is less than 100. This is because we cannot use an existential quantifier to express the fact that `y` is less than 100 for some value of `i`, since we cannot make any assumptions about the initial value of `y`. By using a universal quantifier, we are stating that `y` is less than 100 for all values of `i` that have been executed so far."
