This holds because the loop increments both `x` and `sn` by 1 on each iteration, and the loop continues as long as `unknown()` returns a non-zero value. Therefore, the difference between `x` and `sn` can be at most the number of loop iterations, which is unknown. Since `sn` is initialized to 0 and `x` is incremented by 1 on each iteration, the difference between `x` and `sn` is always non-negative.
