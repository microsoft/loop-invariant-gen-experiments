If `unknown()` returns true, then the lock should be set to 1 and `x` should be equal to `y`. This implies that `x` is now one more than its previous value, and hence `x` is still less than `y`. If `unknown()` returns false, then the lock should be set to 0 and `y` should be incremented by 1. This implies that `x` is still less than `y`, and `x` is still less than `y` since `y` is incremented by 1. \n- After the loop, we know that `x` should be equal to `y - 1` since `y` was incremented by 1 at each iteration until `y` became equal to `x`.

The lock variable can only have the values 0 or 1, as it is assigned either of these values in the loop.\n2. Since `x` is assigned the value of `y` or `y+1` in each iteration, and `y` is always greater than or equal to `x+1`, `x` must always be greater than or equal to 0.\n3. `y` is assigned the value of `y+1` in each iteration, so `y` must always be greater than or equal to `x+1`.\n4. If `lock` is 0, then the else block was executed, which means `y` was incremented by 1, so `x` must be less than `y`.\n5.

Therefore, `lock == 0` and `y == x + 1`. Also, both `x` and `y` are non-negative integers, hence `x >= 0` and `y >= 1`.\n- In every iteration of the loop, `x` is either equal to `y` or less than `y`. If `unknown()` returns true, then `lock` is set to 1 and `x` is set to `y`. Therefore, `lock == 1` and `x == y`. If `unknown()` returns false, then `lock` is set to 0, `x` is set to `y`, and `y` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `lock == 0`, `x < y`, `y >= 1`, and `y == \\old(y) + 1`.\n- After the loop termination, `lock` is expected to be equal to 1, which indicates that the critical section was executed successfully. Therefore, `lock == 1`.\n\nNote that we do not need any implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code as we can use the given ACSL keyword `loop assigns` to handle the non-determinism of the loop.",
