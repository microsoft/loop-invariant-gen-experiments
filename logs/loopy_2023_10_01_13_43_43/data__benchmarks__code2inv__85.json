It holds because `x` starts at `-15000` and is incremented by `y` each iteration. So, if `y` is positive, then `x + y` must be greater than `-15000`.\n- The implication `(y <= 0) ==> (x + y <= -15000)` is true for all iterations where `y` is non-positive. It holds because `x` starts at `-15000` and is incremented by `y` each iteration. So, if `y` is non-positive, then `x + y` must be less than or equal to `-15000`.\n- All the loop invariants hold in every iteration of the loop because:\n  - `x` is always decremented by `y`, which means it can only become more negative or stay the same.\n  - `y` is always incremented by 1, which means it can only become non-negative or stay the same.\n- After the loop terminates, the only guarantee we have is that `x >= 0`, which is not enough to imply the post-condition. However, the implication `(y > 0) ==> (x + y > -15000)` holds, and since `y` is guaranteed to be positive after the loop, this implies that `x + y > -15000`, which is the post-condition. Therefore, the loop invariants together imply the post-condition."
