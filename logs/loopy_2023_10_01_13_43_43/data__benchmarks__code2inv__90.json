This ensures that the values of `x` and `y` remain the same throughout the loop iterations where the lock is not acquired.\n4. `lock = 1 ==> x == y`: If the lock is acquired (`lock = 1`), then the value of `x` is set to the value of `y`. This ensures that the values of `x` and `y` are the same throughout the loop iterations where the lock is acquired.\n5. `(lock == 1) ==> (x == y)`: If the lock is acquired at any point, then `x` and `y` must be equal. This is a direct implication of invariant 4.\n6. `x <= y + 1`: The value of `x` is always less than or equal to the value of `y` plus one. This invariant holds true because in each iteration of the loop, either `y` is incremented by one or `x` is set to `y`, which ensures that `x` remains less than or equal to `y + 1`.\n7. `x != y ==> lock == 0`: If `x` is not equal to `y`, then the lock must not be acquired (`lock = 0`). This is because the only way `x` can become equal to `y` is if the lock is acquired, as per invariant 4. Thus, if `x` is not equal to `y`, then the lock must not be acquired.\n\nThe above loop invariants are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.

The initial values of `x` and `y` satisfy this invariant.\n2. `0 <= y`: The value of `y` is always a non-negative integer. The initial value of `y` satisfies this invariant.\n3. `lock = 0 ==> x == \\old(x) && y == \\old(y)`: If the lock is not acquired (`lock = 0`), then the values of `x` and `y` are not modified. This ensures that the values of `x` and `y` remain the same throughout the loop iterations where the lock is not acquired.\n4. `lock = 1 ==> x == y`: If the lock is acquired (`lock = 1`), then the value of `x` is set to the value of `y`. This ensures that the values of `x` and `y` are the same throughout the loop iterations where the lock is acquired.\n5. `(lock == 1) ==> (x == y)`: If the lock is acquired at any point, then `x` and `y` must be equal. This is a direct implication of invariant 4.\n6. `x <= y + 1`: The value of `x` is always less than or equal to the value of `y` plus one. This invariant holds true because in each iteration of the loop, either `y` is incremented by one or `x` is set to `y`, which ensures that `x` remains less than or equal to `y + 1`.\n7. `x != y ==> lock == 0`: If `x` is not equal to `y`, then the lock must not be acquired (`lock = 0`). This is because the only way `x` can become equal to `y` is if the lock is acquired, as per invariant 4. Thus, if `x` is not equal to `y`, then the lock must not be acquired.\n\nThe above loop invariants are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. These invariants imply the post-condition `lock == 1` at the end of the loop."
