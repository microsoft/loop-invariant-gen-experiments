Therefore, any loop invariants we identify must involve `i`.\n\nSince we do not know how many times the loop will iterate, we cannot simply state that `0 <= i < y` is a loop invariant. Instead, we need to find a property of `i` that remains true throughout the loop, regardless of how many times it iterates.\n\nOne possible loop invariant is that `i` is always greater than or equal to 0. This is because `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop, and is only incremented by 1 inside the loop. Therefore, we can add the following loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= i;\n*/\n```\n\nAnother possible loop invariant is that `i` is always less than or equal to `y`.

This means that the loop may execute any number of times, including zero times.\n\nLoop invariants:\n- `0 <= i <= y` (i.e., `i` is always between 0 and `y`, inclusive). This holds before the loop execution because `i` is initialized to 0, and `y` is non-negative. In every iteration of the loop, `i` either stays the same or increases by 1, but it is guaranteed to never exceed `y`, since the loop condition checks if `i < y`. After the loop termination, `i` is still between 0 and `y` because the only way to exit the loop is if `i` is no longer less than `y`.\n- `x >= 0` and `y >= 0` (i.e., `x` and `y` are non-negative integers).

It holds after the loop termination because nothing in the loop modifies `x` or `y`.\n- `i < y ==> i < \\old(i)` (i.e., if `i` is less than `y` at the beginning of an iteration, then it is strictly less than its previous value). This holds in every iteration of the loop because if `i` is less than `y` at the beginning of an iteration, then `i` is incremented by 1, and therefore, it becomes strictly greater than its previous value. This invariant uses the \\old() notation to refer to the value of `i` at the beginning of the iteration. Note that if `i` is greater than or equal to `y`, then the implication is trivially true. Therefore, the loop invariant is true for all values of `i`.\n\nPutting everything together, the loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= i <= y;\n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n    loop invariant x >= y;\n    loop invariant i < y ==> i < \\old(i);\n*/\n```"
