We do not know the initial value of `n` and `y`, so we cannot assume anything about them.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body:\n- In each iteration of the loop, the value of `x` is incremented by 1.\n- The value of `y` is computed as `n-x`.\n- The loop terminates when `x > n`.\n\nBased on the analysis of the program and loop body, we can propose the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant 1 <= x <= n+1;\n    loop invariant y == n - (x-1);\n    loop invariant y <= n;\n*/\n```\nLet's explain the invariants one by one:\n- The first invariant states that the value of `x` is always between 1 and `n+1`, inclusive. This is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. We start with `x=1` and increment it by 1 in each iteration until `x > n`, so the maximum value of `x` in the loop is `n+1`.\n- The second invariant states that the value of `y` is always equal to `n-(x-1)` in each iteration of the loop. This is true before the loop execution because `x=1` and `y=n-(x-1)=n`. This is also true in every iteration of the loop because we update `y` as `y=n-x+1` and update `x` as `x=x+1`. Therefore, the value of `y` at the end of an iteration is `n-(x-1)`.\n- The third invariant states that the value of `y` is always less than or equal to `n` in each iteration of the loop. This is true before the loop execution because `y` is undefined and the invariant is trivially true. This is also true in every iteration of the loop because we update `y` as `y=n-x+1`, and since `x` is always between 1 and `n+1`, `n-x+1` is always between 1 and `n`, inclusive.\n\nFinally, we need to use implication to take care of the conditional assertion in the program. We can use the guard condition `n > 0` in an implication to rewrite the assertion as `n > 0 ==> y <= n`. Therefore, the final set of loop invariants is:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant 1 <= x <= n+1;\n    loop invariant y == n - (x-1);\n    loop invariant y <= n;\n    loop invariant n > 0 ==> y <= n;\n*/\n```"
