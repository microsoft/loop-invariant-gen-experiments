In every iteration of the loop:\n    - We can see that `x` is decremented by 1 and `y` is incremented by 1 in every iteration of the loop. Therefore, `x` and `y` should always be greater than or equal to 0.\n    - Since `x` starts with the value of `n`, and `y` starts with 0, the sum `x+y` should always be less than or equal to `n`.\n3. After the loop termination:\n    - We know that the loop terminates when `x` is equal to 0. This means that the value of `y` at this point should be equal to `n - x`, which is the same as `n - 0` since `x` is 0. Therefore, `n` should be equal to `x + y`.\n\nPutting all the loop invariants together, we get:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant n >= 0;\n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n    loop invariant x + y <= n;\n    \n    loop invariant (x > 0) ==> (n == (x + y));\n*/\n```\n\nNote that we have used implication for the post-condition, since the assertion is guarded by the loop condition. Also, we have not added any bounds for the variables `x` and `y`, since they are not explicitly bounded in the program and could take any value that satisfies the other loop invariants."

The pre-condition of the program is that `n` is greater than or equal to 0.

The post-condition of the program is `(n == (x + y))`.\n\nBefore the loop:\n- `n >= 0`\n- `x == n`\n- `y == 0`\n\nDuring the loop:\n- `(x > 0)`\n\nAfter each iteration:\n- `n == x + y`\n- `0 <= x <= n`\n- `0 <= y <= n`\n- `x + y <= n`\n\nCombining all these loop invariants, we get:\n\n```\n/*@ \nloop invariant 0 <= x <= n;\nloop invariant 0 <= y <= n;\nloop invariant x + y <= n;\nloop invariant n >= 0;\nloop invariant x == n || x < n;\nloop invariant n == x + y ==> (x == 0);\nloop invariant n == x + y ==> (y <= n);\nloop invariant n == x + y ==> (y >= 0);\nloop invariant (x > 0) ==> (n == \\at(x, Pre) + \\at(y, Pre));\n*/\n```\n\nNote that we have used `\\at(x, Pre)` to refer to the value of `x` before the loop iteration. Since `x` is not non-deterministic, we do not need to use an implication to make the loop invariant trivially true at the beginning of the loop. \n\nAlso, we have used implications to handle the guarded assertion. The last loop invariant specifies that if `x` is greater than 0 at the end of an iteration, then `n` must be equal to the sum of the values of `x` and `y` before the iteration. This is because `x` is decremented by 1 and `y` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, so the sum of their values before the iteration must be equal to the sum of their values after the iteration, plus 1.\n\nFinally, we have added loop invariants to bound the values of `x` and `y`. These loop invariants are derived from the fact that `x` is decremented by 1 and `y` is incremented by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, `x` cannot be negative and `y` cannot be greater than `n`. Also, the sum of `x` and `y` cannot be greater than `n`.\n\nThese loop invariants imply the post-condition of the program, which is `(n == (x + y))`."
