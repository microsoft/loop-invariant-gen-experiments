Also, since `sn` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, `sn` is always equal to or greater than `i - 1`.\n- The loop condition is `i <= size`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, `i` must eventually become greater than `size`.

At this point, `sn` must be less than or equal to `size`.\n- The post-condition states that if `sn` is not equal to `size`, then `sn` must be equal to 0.
