Therefore, `x >= 0` is a loop invariant. Also, since `x` is initialized to `n`, it is always less than or equal to `n`.

Since there are no other assignments to `n` or `x` in the program, `n` and `x` maintain their initial relationship. Therefore, we can use the initialization `x = n` to our advantage and state that `x == 0` implies `n >= 0`.\n\nPutting everything together, the loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant x <= n;\n    loop invariant x == 0 ==> n >= 0;\n*/\n```"
