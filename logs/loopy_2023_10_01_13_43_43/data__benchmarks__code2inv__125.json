This is true before the loop execution because `x` and `y` are assigned values at the beginning of the program, and we assume that these values are non-negative. This is true in every iteration of the loop because `x` and `y` are decremented by 1 in each iteration, and since they are non-negative at the beginning of the loop, they remain non-negative throughout the loop. This is also true after the loop termination because `x` becomes 0 at the end of the loop, and since it is non-negative, `y` must also be non-negative.\n- `x + y == \\at(x, Pre) + \\at(y, Pre)`: This loop invariant ensures that the sum of `x` and `y` is constant throughout the loop. This is true before the loop execution because `x` and `y` are assigned values at the beginning of the program, and the sum of these values is constant. This is true in every iteration of the loop because `x` and `y` are both decremented by 1 in each iteration, and the sum of `x` and `y` remains constant. This is also true after the loop termination because `x` becomes 0 at the end of the loop, and the sum of `x` and `y` must be equal to the sum of their initial values.\n- `i == \\at(x, Pre) && j == \\at(y, Pre)`: This loop invariant ensures that `i` and `j` are initialized to `x` and `y`, respectively, at the beginning of the program. This is true before the loop execution because `i` and `j` are assigned values at the beginning of the program, and we assume that these values are equal to `x` and `y`, respectively. This is true in every iteration of the loop because `i` and `j` are not modified inside the loop. This is also true after the loop termination because `x` becomes 0 at the end of the loop, and we assume that `i` and `j` have not been modified inside the loop, so they must still be equal to their initial values.\n- `(y == 0 || x > 0 ==> i == j)`: This loop invariant ensures that if `y` becomes 0 or `x` becomes negative, then `i` must be equal to `j`. This is true before the loop execution because `i` and `j` are assigned values at the beginning of the program, and we assume that they are equal. This is true in every iteration of the loop because either `y` becomes 0 or `x` becomes negative in each iteration, and if either of these conditions is true, then `i` must be equal to `j`. This is also true after the loop termination because if `y` is not 0, then the assertion is not executed, so it is trivially true. If `y` is 0, then `x` must also be 0, and we assume that `i` and `j` have not been modified inside the loop, so they must still be equal."
