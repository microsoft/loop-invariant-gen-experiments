So, the sum of `i` and `x` should always be equal to the sum of `j` and `y`. This can be expressed as `i + x == j + y`.\n- After the loop terminates, if `i` is equal to `j`, then we know that `i + x` is equal to `j + y` because of the loop invariant. Since `i` is equal to `j`, it follows that `x` must be equal to `y`. Therefore, `(y == 0)` must be true. We express this as an implication: `(i == j) ==> (y == 0)`. \n\nVariable bounds:\n- There are no explicit bounds mentioned in the program for any variable. Therefore, we cannot add any bounds.\n\nVariable relations:\n- There are no explicit relations mentioned in the program between any variables.
