This can be split into two parts:\n        - `x + y <= 3 * i`: This is true because in every iteration of the loop, either `x` or `y` increases by 1, and the other increases by 2, so their sum increases by 3. Therefore, `x + y` is always less than or equal to `3 * i`.\n        - `x + y >= 3 * i`: This is true because if we assume that the assertion holds true before the loop execution (`x = 0`, `y = 0`, `i = 0`), and if it holds true in every iteration of the loop, then it must also hold true after the loop termination. Therefore, we can use this assumption to prove that `x + y` is always greater than or equal to `3 * i`.\n    - If `unknown()` returns 1 (true), then `x` increases by 1 and `y` increases by 2. Therefore, `x` becomes `2 * (i - 1) + 1` and `y` becomes `2 * (i - 1) + 2`.\n    - If `unknown()` returns 0 (false), then `x` increases by 2 and `y` increases by 1. Therefore, `x` becomes `2 * (i - 1) + 2` and `y` becomes `2 * (i - 1) + 1`.\n- After the loop termination:\n    - Since `i` is incremented by 1 in every iteration of the loop, it reaches `n` after `n` iterations of the loop.\n    - The assertion that needs to be verified is `((3 * n) == (x + y))`. If `unknown()` returned 1 (true) for all iterations of the loop, then `x` becomes `2 * n - 1` and `y` becomes `2 * n`. If `unknown()` returned 0 (false) for all iterations of the loop, then `x` becomes `2 * n` and `y` becomes `2 * n - 1`. In both cases, `x + y` is equal to `3 * n`."

This can be split into two parts:\n        - `x + y <= 3 * i`: This is true because in every iteration of the loop, either `x` or `y` increases by 1, and the other increases by 2, so their sum increases by 3. Therefore, `x + y` is always less than or equal to `3 * i`.\n        - `x + y >= 3 * i`: This is true because if we assume that the assertion holds true before the loop execution (`x = 0`, `y = 0`, `i = 0`), and if it holds true in every iteration of the loop, then it must also hold true after the loop termination. Therefore, we can use this assumption to prove that `x + y` is always greater than or equal to `3 * i`.\n    - If `unknown()` returns 1 (true), then `x` increases by 1 and `y` increases by 2. Therefore, `x` becomes `2 * (i - 1) + 1` and `y` becomes `2 * (i - 1) + 2`.\n    - If `unknown()` returns 0 (false), then `x` increases by 2 and `y` increases by 1. Therefore, `x` becomes `2 * (i - 1) + 2` and `y` becomes `2 * (i - 1) + 1`.\n- After the loop termination:\n    - Since `i` is incremented by 1 in every iteration of the loop, it reaches `n` after `n` iterations of the loop.\n    - The assertion that needs to be verified is `((3 * n) == (x + y))`. If `unknown()` returned 1 (true) for all iterations of the loop, then `x` becomes `2 * n - 1` and `y` becomes `2 * n`. If `unknown()` returned 0 (false) for all iterations of the loop, then `x` becomes `2 * n` and `y` becomes `2 * n - 1`. In both cases, `x + y` is equal to `3 * n`.",
