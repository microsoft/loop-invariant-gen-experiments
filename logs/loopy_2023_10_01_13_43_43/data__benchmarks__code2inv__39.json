We start with the loop entry.\n\nBefore the loop, we have the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 1 <= c <= n;\n*/\n```\nThis loop invariant is true before the loop entry because `c` is initialized to `0` and we have `assume(n > 0)`. Therefore, `c` is always greater than or equal to `1` and less than or equal to `n`.\n\nDuring the loop execution, we need to find a loop invariant that holds in every iteration of the loop. We can use the loop condition `unknown()` to help us find such an invariant.\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 1 <= c <= n;\n    loop invariant (c == n) ==> unknown();\n    loop invariant (c < n) ==> unknown();\n*/\n```\nThe first loop invariant is the same as before. \n\nThe second loop invariant states that if `c` is equal to `n`, then the loop must continue (`unknown()` must be true). This is because if `c` is equal to `n`, we set `c` to `1` to start over. If `unknown()` is false, then the loop will terminate and we will have `c <= n`. Therefore, `(c == n) ==> unknown()` is true.\n\nThe third loop invariant states that if `c` is less than `n`, then the loop may continue or terminate (`unknown()` may be true or false). This is because if `c` is less than `n`, we increment `c` by `1`. If `c` becomes equal to `n`, then the second loop invariant applies. Otherwise, we continue the loop and `unknown()` may be true or false. Therefore, `(c < n) ==> unknown()` is true.\n\nAfter the loop execution, we have the following loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 1 <= c <= n;\n    loop invariant (c == n) ==> unknown();\n    loop invariant (c < n) ==> unknown();\n    loop invariant (c == n) ==> (c <= n);\n*/\n```\nThis loop invariant states that if `c` is equal to `n`, then the loop must continue (`unknown()` must be true) and `c` must be less than or equal to `n`. If `c` is less than `n`, then the loop may continue or terminate (`unknown()` may be true or false) and `c` must be less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, `(c == n) ==> (c <= n)` is true.\n\nFinally, we use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the assertion:\n```\nif(c == n) {\n        \n    {;\n//@ assert (unknown() ==> (c <= n));\n}\n}\n```\nThis assertion is only executed if `c` is equal to `n`. Therefore, we use implication to state that if `unknown()` is true, then `c` must be less than or equal to `n`. This is because if `unknown()` is false, then the loop will terminate and we will have `c <= n`."

The loop body contains an if-else statement that updates the value of `c` based on its current value. We can split the loop invariants into three parts:\n\n1. Before loop execution: Since `n` is assumed to be greater than 0, we can use that assumption as a loop invariant before the loop execution.\n\n```\n/*@ loop invariant n > 0; */\n```\n\n2. In every iteration of the loop: We need to find a loop invariant that is preserved by the loop body. The loop body updates the value of `c` based on its current value. We can use the following loop invariant to bound the maximum value that `c` can take:\n\n```\n/*@ loop invariant 1 <= c <= n; */\n```\n\nThe above loop invariant states that `c` is always greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n`.\n\n3.

We can use the following loop invariant:\n\n```\n/*@ loop invariant c <= n; */\n```\n\nThis loop invariant implies the post-condition because it states that `c` is always less than or equal to `n`.\n\nCombining all the loop invariants, we get:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant n > 0;\n    loop invariant 1 <= c <= n;\n    loop invariant c <= n;\n*/\n```\n\nWe also need to handle the non-deterministic behavior of the `unknown()` function.
