Therefore, `y` can have a maximum value of 2.\n- The loop invariant `(x%2 == 0) && (y%2 == 0)` holds before the loop execution since `x` and `y` are initialized with even values and are incremented by even values in every iteration of the loop. Therefore, they remain even throughout the execution of the loop.\n- The loop invariant holds in every iteration of the loop since the loop body only increments `x` and `y` by 2, which preserves the loop invariants.\n- The loop invariant holds after the loop termination since the loop condition only allows the loop to terminate when `unknown()` function returns 0. Therefore, the loop executes a finite number of times and the loop invariants hold at the end of the loop.\n- Since the assertion is guarded by `(x == 4)`, we add an implication in the loop invariant to take care of this condition:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0 && x <= 4;\n    loop invariant y >= 0 && y <= 2;\n    loop invariant (x%2 == 0) && (y%2 == 0);\n    loop invariant (x != 4) ==> (y == 0);\n*/\n```\n- There are no non-deterministic variables in the program.
