This is necessary to ensure that the loop condition `(x > 1)` is eventually false. We also need to ensure that `x` does not exceed `n`. This is because `x` is initialized to `n` before the loop and is decremented by 1 in each iteration. So, we need to make sure that `x` does not become negative during the loop execution.\n- After the loop termination, we need to check the final value of `x`. If `x` is 1, then we know that the loop condition `(x > 1)` is false, which means that the loop has terminated successfully. In this case, we can conclude that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, since `x` has been decremented by 1 in each iteration. If `x` is not 1, then we know that the loop terminated prematurely, which means that `x` became negative during the loop execution. In this case, we can conclude that `n` is less than 0, since `x` started with the value of `n` and was decremented by 1 in each iteration.\n\nNote that since the variables `n` and `x` are not initialized, we cannot make any assumptions about their values at the beginning of the loop. However, we can use the loop invariants to ensure that their values remain within certain bounds during the loop execution. Also, since there are no function calls in the program, we do not need to worry about any non-deterministic behavior."
