Therefore, we cannot make any assumptions about the value of x before the loop starts.\n- In every iteration of the loop, x is decremented by 1, so we can say that 2 <= x <= n+1. The upper bound is n+1 because x is initialized with n, and it can be decremented n times at most.\n- After the loop terminates, the only possible value of x is 1. Therefore, we can say that (x == 1). However, we need to make sure that this implies the post-condition. The post-condition is (n >= 0) ==> (x == 1). We can use implication to ensure that the invariant implies the post-condition: (x == 1) ==> (n >= 1).

This is because initially, `x` is assigned the value of `n`, and in each iteration, it is decremented by 1, so it can never be less than 1 or greater than `n+1`.\n- The third loop invariant is more complex. It states that for all integers `i` such that `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n-x+1`, the value of `x+i` at the loop entry is equal to `n-i`. This invariant ensures that the loop is correctly counting down from `n` to 1. For example, at the beginning of the loop, `x` is equal to `n`, and for `i=0`, the invariant ensures that `x+i` is equal to `n`, which is correct. In the next iteration, `x` is decremented by 1 and becomes `n-1`, and for `i=0`, the invariant ensures that `x+i` is equal to `n-1`, which is again correct. This pattern continues until `x` becomes 1, and for `i=0`, the invariant ensures that `x+i` is equal to `n-x+1`, which is equal to 1. Hence, the invariant ensures that `x` correctly counts down from `n` to 1.\n- The fourth loop invariant is an implication. It states that if `n` is less than 0, then `x` must be equal to `n`. This is because in this case, the loop is not executed at all, and `x` should not be changed from its initial value.\n- The fifth loop invariant is also an implication. It states that if `n` is non-negative and `x` is equal to 1, then the assertion is trivially true. This is because in this case, the loop has successfully counted down from `n` to 1, and the post-condition is satisfied."
