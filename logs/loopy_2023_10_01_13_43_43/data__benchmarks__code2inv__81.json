The initial value of `i` is 0 and it can only be incremented by 1 in each iteration. Since the loop condition is non-deterministic, we cannot determine the exact number of iterations, but we know that `i` cannot exceed the value of `y`.\n2. `i <= y ==> i < y` - This invariant holds true in every iteration of the loop. If `i` is less than or equal to `y`, then `i` must be less than `y`. This is because if `i` is equal to `y`, then the loop will terminate, which means that the condition `i < y` will no longer hold.\n3. `i < y ==> 0 <= i` - This invariant holds true in every iteration of the loop. If `i` is less than `y`, then `i` must be greater than or equal to 0. This is because `i` is initialized to 0 and can only be incremented by 1 in each iteration, which means that it can never be negative.\n4. `x >= 0` - This invariant holds true before the loop execution and after the loop termination. This is because `x` is initialized to some non-negative value and is never modified in the loop.\n5. `y >= 0` - This invariant holds true before the loop execution and after the loop termination. This is because `y` is initialized to some non-negative value and is never modified in the loop.\n6. `x >= y` - This invariant holds true before the loop execution and after the loop termination. This is because `x` is initialized to some value that is greater than or equal to `y` and is never modified in the loop.\n7. `i >= 0 ==> (i < y ==> i >= 0)` - This invariant holds true in every iteration of the loop. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, then if `i` is less than `y`, it must be greater than or equal to 0. This is because `i` is initialized to 0 and can only be incremented by 1 in each iteration, which means that it can never be negative.\n\nUsing these loop invariants, we can verify the post-condition `i >= 0` guarded by the condition `(i < y)` at the end of the loop. Combining loop invariants 1, 2, 3, and 7, we get:\n```\n0 <= i <= y ==> (i < y ==> i >= 0)\n```\nUsing implication, we can rewrite the assertion as:\n```\n(i < y) ==> (i >= 0)\n```\nwhich is the same as the original post-condition guarded by `(i < y)`."
