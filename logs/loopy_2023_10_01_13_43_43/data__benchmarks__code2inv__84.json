Hence, `x` is less than 0. Therefore, we can add the invariant `x <= -50`. Also, `y` is not assigned any value, but it is used in the loop body. Hence, `y` should be greater than or equal to 0. So, we can add the invariant `y >= 0`. Further, we can see that `x + y` is less than or equal to -50 before the loop execution. Hence, we can add the invariant `x + y <= -50`. Also, `y` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. Hence, before the loop execution, `y - 1` should be less than or equal to `x`. So, we can add the invariant `y - 1 <= x`.\n- In every iteration, we can see that `y` is incremented by 1 and `x` is added to it. Hence, we can add the invariant `x + y <= -50`. Also, we already know from the previous invariant that `y - 1` should be less than or equal to `x`. Therefore, we can add the invariant `y - 1 <= x`.\n- After the loop termination, we need to ensure that `y` is greater than 0. However, we can see that the assertion is guarded by a condition `(x < 0)` which implies that `y` is greater than 0. Hence, we can use this condition in an implication to add the invariant `y > 0 ==> y >= 1`.\n\nTherefore, the final loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n    loop invariant x <= -50;\n    loop invariant x + y <= -50;\n    loop invariant y - 1 <= x;\n    loop invariant y >= 1 ==> x + y <= -50;\n    loop invariant y >= 1 ==> y - 1 <= x;\n*/\n```"

We also need to ensure that `y` is always non-negative, since `y` is incremented in every iteration. Additionally, since `x` is incremented by `y` in every iteration, we must ensure that `y <= x + 50` to ensure that `x` eventually becomes non-negative and the loop terminates.\n- After the loop termination, we need to ensure that if `x >= 0`, then `y > 0` to satisfy the post-condition. \n\nBounds on variables:\n- `x` can take any integer value, so we do not have any bounds to impose on it.\n- `y` is incremented by 1 in every iteration, so it must always be non-negative. Thus, we have `y >= 0` as a loop invariant.\n- The maximum value that `y` can take is when `x = -1` and `y = 50`. Therefore, we have `y <= x + 50` as a loop invariant.\n\nUsing implication:\n- Since the assertion `y > 0` is not guarded by any condition, we can directly use it in the loop invariant after the loop termination. However, we need to use implication to account for the conditional nature of the code in the loop invariants.\n- For example, we can use implication to express the relation `y <= x + 50` as `(x < 0) ==> (y <= x + 50)`. This ensures that the relation holds only when `x < 0`, which is the condition for the loop to execute.\n- Similarly, we can use implication to express the relation `x >= 0 ==> y > 0` as `(x >= 0) ==> (y > 0)`. This ensures that the relation holds only when `x >= 0`, which is the condition after the loop termination.\n\nPutting it all together:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x < 0;\n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n    loop invariant (x < 0) ==> (y <= x + 50);\n    loop invariant (x >= 0) ==> (y > 0);\n*/\n```"
