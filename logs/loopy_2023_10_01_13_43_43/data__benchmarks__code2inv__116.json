If `sn` is always equal to `x - 1`, then the loop invariant implies the assertion `sn == -1`. This is because the loop condition `unknown()` ensures that the loop executes at least once. Therefore, if `sn` is equal to `x - 1` when the loop terminates, then `x` must be greater than `sn` by 1, which means that the loop condition `unknown()` must have returned 0 in the last iteration. This in turn implies that `sn` must be equal to -1. If `sn` is not always equal to `x - 1`, then the loop invariant is trivially true and does not affect the correctness of the program."

This is expressed by the formula `sn == x + sn_old`.\n- After the loop termination, if `(sn != x)`, then the assertion `(sn == -1)` must hold. This is because the only way for `sn` to be different from `x` is if the loop is terminated prematurely by `unknown()` returning 0. In that case, `sn` has the value `x - 1`, which is equivalent to the sum of all integers from 1 to `x - 1`. This is expressed by the formula `sn == x - 1`.
