For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values. Do not use variables that have garbage values.**\n- **Do not use keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops.**\n- **Variables that are not explicitly initialized, could have garbage values. Do not make any assumptions about such values.**\n- **Do not use the \\at(x, Pre) notation for any variable x.**\n- **Do not use non-deterministic function calls.**\n"

Before the loop execution, `m >= 1` and `n` is non-negative.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, `1 <= x <= n`.\n3. In every iteration of the loop, if `unknown()` returns true, then `m >= x`.\n4. After the loop termination, `m >= 1`.\n\nNow, let's explain each of these loop invariants:\n\n1. Before the loop execution, `m >= 1` and `n` is non-negative.\n\nWe know that `m` is initialized to 1 and it is never assigned a value smaller than 1. Therefore, `m >= 1` is true before the loop starts. Also, since `n` is uninitialized, we cannot make any assumptions about its value. However, we know that `n` is an integer, so it cannot be negative. Therefore, `n >= 0` is a loop invariant that holds before the loop starts.\n\n2. In every iteration of the loop, `1 <= x <= n`.\n\nWe know that `x` is initialized to 1 and it is incremented by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, `1 <= x` is true before the loop starts. Also, we know that the loop condition is `x < n`, so `x <= n - 1`. Therefore, we can conclude that `1 <= x <= n`.\n\n3. In every iteration of the loop, if `unknown()` returns true, then `m >= x`.\n\nIf `unknown()` returns true, then `m` is assigned the value of `x`. Therefore, `m >= x` is true in that iteration. If `unknown()` returns false, then `m` remains unchanged, so the loop invariant holds trivially. Therefore, we can conclude that `m >= x` is a loop invariant.\n\n4. After the loop termination, `m >= 1`.\n\nWe know that `m` is assigned the value of `x` whenever `unknown()` returns true. Also, we know that `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, `m` is always equal to or greater than the maximum value of `x` in the loop. Since `x <= n` at the end of the loop, we can conclude that `m >= n` at the end of the loop. However, we can make a stronger conclusion based on the loop invariant 3. We know that `m >= x` holds in every iteration of the loop. Therefore, `m` is always equal to or greater than the maximum value of `x` in the loop, regardless of whether `unknown()` returns true or false. Since `x` reaches the maximum value of `n - 1` at the end of the loop, we can conclude that `m >= n - 1`. Therefore, we can conclude that `m >= 1` after the loop termination.\n\nBased on these loop invariants, we can write the following code block:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant m >= 1;\n    loop invariant n >= 0;\n    loop invariant 1 <= x <= n;\n    loop invariant (unknown() == 0 || m >= x);\n*/\n```"

This is because if `m` is greater than 1, then it means that `m` has been updated at least once inside the loop, and hence `x` cannot be equal to `n`.\n- Since the variable `n` is not initialized and contains garbage value, we don't add any invariant related to it. \n- We don't need any implication to make the invariants trivially true, because all variables are initialized with meaningful values.",
