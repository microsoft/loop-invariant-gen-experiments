Since `y >= 1`, `j` can only take non-negative values.\n- `0 <= i`: `i` is initialized to `0`, and it is incremented by `1` in each iteration of the loop. Since `i` cannot take negative values, it is always non-negative.\n- `y >= 1`: `y` is initialized to `1`, and it is not modified inside the loop. Therefore, `y` is always greater than or equal to `1`.\n- `i <= x + 1`: At the beginning of each iteration, `i` is incremented by `1`. Therefore, after `k` iterations, `i` will take the value `k`. Since the loop continues as long as `i <= x`, the loop will terminate after `x+1` iterations. Hence, `i <= x+1`.\n- `(i <= x) ==> (i + 1 <= x + 1)`: If `i` is less than or equal to `x`, it means that the loop has not terminated yet, and `i` will be incremented by `1` in the current iteration. Therefore, `i+1` will be less than or equal to `x+1` after the current iteration.\n- `(i <= x) ==> (j + y <= i*y + 1)`: If `i` is less than or equal to `x`, it means that the loop has not terminated yet, and `j` will be incremented by `y` in the current iteration. Therefore, `j+y` will be less than or equal to `i*y+1` after the current iteration. This is because, for all `k` such that `0 <= k <= i`, we have `y <= y*y^k = y^(k+1) <= i*y+1`, since `y >= 1`.\n- `(i > x) ==> (i == j) ==> (y != 1)`: If `i` is greater than `x`, it means that the loop has terminated, and `i` has taken the value `x+1`. Since `i` is incremented by `1` in each iteration, `i` will be equal to the number of iterations of the loop. Similarly, `j` will be equal to the sum of `y` in each iteration of the loop. Therefore, if `i` is equal to `j`, it means that `j` is equal to the sum of `y` from `0` to `x`, which is equal to `(x*(x+1))/2 + 1`. If `y` is equal to `1`, this sum will be equal to `(x*(x+1))/2 + 1 = (i-1)*i/2 + 1`, which is not equal to `i` for any non-negative integer `i`. Therefore, we can use the implication `(y == 1) ==> (i != j)` to make the invariant trivially true when `y` is equal to `1`."
