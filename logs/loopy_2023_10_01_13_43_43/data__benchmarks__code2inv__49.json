Otherwise, `c` is set to 1. Therefore, `c` must always be greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to `n`.\n- If `unknown()` returns 0, then `c` must be equal to 1 as per the code. Therefore, if `unknown()` returns 0, then `(c == 1)` must be true.\n- If `unknown()` returns a non-zero value, then `c` must be less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, if `unknown()` returns a non-zero value, then `(c <= n)` must be true.\n- After the loop termination, `n` must still be greater than 0. Also, if `n` is less than or equal to -1, then `c` must not be equal to `n`. Therefore, if `(n <= -1)`, then `(c != n)` must be true. Finally, if `n` is greater than -1, then `c` must be less than or equal to `n`.
