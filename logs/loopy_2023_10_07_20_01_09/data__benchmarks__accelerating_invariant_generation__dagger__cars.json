If the assertion is false, label the program False.\n\nRules:\n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values.**\n- **Variables that are not explicitly initialized, could have garbage values. Do not make any assumptions about such values.**\n- **Check if the assertion is reachable, given the pre-conditions and the loop. If it is reachable, check if the assertion evaluates to true.

Since x2 is only updated within the loop, we cannot guarantee that 5 * t + 75 >= x2 in every iteration, so we cannot determine if this assertion is true.\n\n4. The fourth assertion is true because of the precondition v2 <= 5, and the only updates to v2 inside the loop are v2 = v2 - 1 or v2 = v2 + 1. The maximum value of v2 is 6, so the assertion is true.\n\n5. The fifth assertion is true because of the precondition v3 >= 0.\n\n6. The sixth assertion is true because of the precondition v2 + 5 >= 0. Since the maximum value of v2 is 6, v2 + 6 >= 0.\n\n7. The seventh assertion depends on the value of t and x2, which are updated inside the loop. We cannot determine if x2 + 5 * t >= 75 in every iteration, so we cannot determine if this assertion is true.\n\n8. The eighth assertion depends on the values of t, v1, v2, and v3, which are updated inside the loop. We cannot determine if v1 - 2 * v2 + v3 + 2 * t >= 0 in every iteration, so we cannot determine if this assertion is true.\n\n9. The ninth assertion is true because of the precondition v1 - v3 >= 0.\n\nSince we cannot determine the truth value of assertions 3, 7, and 8, we cannot label the program as True.
