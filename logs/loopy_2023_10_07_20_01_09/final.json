If input is set to 0 by unknown_int() during the loop execution.\n- In scenario 1, the loop will not run, and the initial values will be used. In this case, the assertion evaluates to true as x1=0, x2=x3=0, and x4=-1.\n- In scenario 2, the loop will run, and the values of x1, x2, x3, and x4 will be updated according to the if condition inside the loop. However, the if condition inside the loop is the same as the assertion. So if the if condition is true, the assertion will also be true.\n\nBased on the analysis, the assertion will evaluate to true for both scenarios.

Check if the assertion expression is reachable and evaluates to true, for the given pre-conditions and the loop condition:\n   Assertion: x >= y\n\n   The loop will iterate as long as y < 1000. After each iteration, y will increase by 1 and x will increase by the value of y before the increase. When the loop terminates, y will be equal to 1000. \n\n   Let's analyze how x changes during the iterations:\n\n   - Before the first iteration: x = 1\n   - After the first iteration: x = x + y = 1 + 0 = 1, y = 1\n   - After the second iteration: x = x + y = 1 + 1 = 2, y = 2\n   - After the third iteration: x = x + y = 2 + 2 = 4, y = 3\n   ...\n   - After the last iteration: x = x + y = ... + 999, y = 1000\n\n   We can observe a pattern: after each iteration, x is equal to the sum of all integers from 0 to y - 1 (inclusive). Therefore, when the loop terminates, x will be equal to the sum of all integers from 0 to 999, which is (999 * 1000) / 2 = 499500.\n\n   Since x = 499500 and y = 1000, x >= y is true.\n\n4.
