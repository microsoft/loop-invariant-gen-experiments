Do not make any assumptions about such values.**\n- **Check if the assertion is reachable, given the pre-conditions and the loop. If it is reachable, check if the assertion evaluates to true.

Since `j` is incremented inside the loop and is initially set to 0, the assertion `0 <= j` will always evaluate to true.\n2.
