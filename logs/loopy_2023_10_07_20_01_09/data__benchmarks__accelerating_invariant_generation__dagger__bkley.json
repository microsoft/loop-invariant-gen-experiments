For example: \n```\n//@ assert x > 0;\n```\n\nInstructions:\n- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. \n- Check if the assertion expression is reachable and evaluates to true, for the given pre-conditions and the loop condition.\n- If the assertion is true, label the program True.

Assertion: invalid + unowned + exclusive + nonexclusive >= 1\n   - Initially, invalid >= 1, and all other variables are 0. So, the initial value of the expression is >= 1.\n   - Inside the loop, the variables are modified in such a way that their sum remains >= 1.\n     - When invalid is decreased by 1, unowned is increased by 1, maintaining the sum.\n     - When exclusive is increased by 1, invalid is increased by unowned + nonexclusive - 1, maintaining the sum.\n     - When exclusive is set to 1, invalid is increased by unowned + exclusive + nonexclusive - 1, maintaining the sum.\n   - Therefore, the assertion holds true.\n\nSince all assertions are reachable and evaluate to true, we can label the program as:\n\n<label> True </label>"
