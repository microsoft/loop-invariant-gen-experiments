For example: \n```\n//@ assert x > 0;\n```\n\nInstructions:\n- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. \n- Check if the assertion expression is reachable and evaluates to true, for the given pre-conditions and the loop condition.\n- If the assertion is true, label the program True. If the assertion is false, label the program False.\n\nRules:\n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values.**\n- **Variables that are not explicitly initialized, could have garbage values. Do not make any assumptions about such values.**\n- **Check if the assertion is reachable, given the pre-conditions and the loop. If it is reachable, check if the assertion evaluates to true. If it evaluates to true, label the program True. If it evaluates to false, label the program False.**\n- **If the assertion is not reachable, label the program True.**\n- **If the assertion is inside a loop, check if the assertion evaluates to true in every iteration of the loop.**\n- **If the assertion is inside an if-statement and the if-statement is reachable, check if the assertion evaluates to true under the given condition.**\n- Output the final label in the following format: \n<label> True (or False) </label>\n"

When the loop terminates, y will still be positive since it is incremented by 1 in every iteration.

In this case, the assertion is not reachable, and we can consider it true according to the rules.\n\nIf y's initial garbage value is 0, in the first iteration, x will not change, and y will become 1. In the following iterations, y will be positive, and the loop will eventually terminate. In this case, the assertion @(y > 0) will be true.\n\nIn all possible cases, the assertion either evaluates to true or is not reachable. Therefore, we can label the program:\n\n<label> True </label>"
