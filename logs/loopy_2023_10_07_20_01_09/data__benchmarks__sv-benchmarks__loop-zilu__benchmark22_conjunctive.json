For example: \n```\n//@ assert x > 0;\n```\n\nInstructions:\n- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. \n- Check if the assertion expression is reachable and evaluates to true, for the given pre-conditions and the loop condition.\n- If the assertion is true, label the program True. If the assertion is false, label the program False.\n\nRules:\n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values.**\n- **Variables that are not explicitly initialized, could have garbage values. Do not make any assumptions about such values.**\n- **Check if the assertion is reachable, given the pre-conditions and the loop. If it is reachable, check if the assertion evaluates to true.

We need to consider both cases.\n  - Case 1: If the loop does not run, x remains 1 and y remains 0. In this case, x >= y (1 >= 0) and the assertion is true.\n  - Case 2: If the loop runs, x is incremented by y and y is incremented by 1 in each iteration. Since y starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 in each iteration, y will always be non-negative.
