Pre-condition:\nThe pre-condition of the while loop is `i < n`. This means that the loop will execute at least once if `n` is greater than 0.\n2. Loop condition:\nThe loop condition is `i < n`. This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.\n3. Loop body:\nThe loop body consists of three statements:\n* `i++`: This increments the value of `i` by 1.\n* `x++`: This increments the value of `x` by 1.\n* `if(i%2 == 0) y++`: This increments the value of `y` by 1 if `i` is even.\n\nBased on the loop body, we can identify the following loop invariants:\n\n1. `i <= n`: This is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n2. `x <= n`: This is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n3. `y <= n`: This is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nNote that these loop invariants are not conjunctions, so we do not need to split them into parts.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the while loop in the program are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i <= n;\n    loop invariant x <= n;\n    loop invariant y <= n;\n*/\n```"
