We can use these conditions to find the loop invariant that is true after the loop termination.\n\nThe loop invariant that is true after the loop termination is:\n```\nj == n && k == 0\n```\nThis loop invariant tells us that `j` is equal to `n`, and `k` is equal to 0.\n\nNow, we have found all the loop invariants for the loop in the program. The loop invariants are:\n```\nn >= 1 && k >= n && j == 0 // before the loop execution\nj <= n-1 && k >= n-1 // in every iteration of the loop\nj == n && k == 0 // after the loop termination\n```\nThese loop invariants tell us that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, and `j` is equal to 0 before the loop execution. In every iteration of the loop, `j` is less than or equal to `n-1`, and `k` is greater than or equal to `n-1`. After the loop termination, `j` is equal to `n`, and `k` is equal to 0."
