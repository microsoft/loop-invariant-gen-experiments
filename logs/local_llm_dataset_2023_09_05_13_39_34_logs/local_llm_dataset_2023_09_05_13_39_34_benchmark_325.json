A loop invariant is a condition that remains true before, during, and after the loop execution.

Loop Body:\nThe loop body consists of two statements: `j--;` and `k--;`. These statements decrement the values of `j` and `k` by 1 in each iteration of the loop.\n2. Loop Condition:\nThe loop condition is `j>0 && n>0`. This condition checks if `j` is greater than 0 and `n` is greater than 0. If either of these conditions is false, the loop will terminate.\n3. Loop Invariants:\nBased on the analysis of the loop body and the loop condition, we can identify the following loop invariants:\n\n(i) Before the loop execution, `j >= 0` and `k >= 0`. This is because the loop condition checks if `j` and `k` are greater than 0, and the loop body decrements their values by 1 in each iteration.\n\n(ii) In every iteration of the loop, `j >= 0` and `k >= 0`. This is because the loop body decrements the values of `j` and `k` by 1 in each iteration, and the loop condition checks if `j` and `k` are greater than 0.\n\n(iii) After the loop termination, `j == 0` and `k == 0`. This is because the loop condition checks if `j` and `k` are greater than 0, and the loop body decrements their values by 1 in each iteration. If the loop terminates, it means that `j` and `k` are both equal to 0.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the loop in the program are:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant j >= 0 && k >= 0;\n    loop invariant j >= 0 && k >= 0;\n    loop invariant j == 0 && k == 0;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have split the loop invariant into its parts, as requested in the problem statement."
