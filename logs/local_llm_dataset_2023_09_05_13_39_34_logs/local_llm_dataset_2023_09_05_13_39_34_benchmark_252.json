The conditions under which these variables are modified are:\n\n* `x` is incremented by 2 if `y` is even, and decremented by 2 if `y` is odd.\n* `y` is incremented by 2 if `x` is even, and decremented by 2 if `x` is odd.\n\nBased on these conditions, we can identify the following loop invariants:\n\n* Before the loop execution, `x` is 0 and `y` is `unknown_uint()`.\n* In every iteration of the loop, `x` is even if `y` is even, and `x` is odd if `y` is odd.\n* After the loop termination, `x` is equal to `y` modulo 2.\n\nThese loop invariants can be used to verify the post-condition of the loop, which is `(x % 2) == (y % 2)`.\n\nHere is the ACSL annotation for the loop:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x % 2 == y % 2;\n    loop invariant x % 2 == 0 || x % 2 == 1;\n    loop variant y % 2 == 0 || y % 2 == 1;\n*/\n```\nNote that the loop variant `y % 2 == 0 || y % 2 == 1` is not strictly necessary, but it can be useful for Frama-C to prove the loop termination."

To find the loop invariants, we need to analyze the loop body and the loop condition.\n\nHere are the loop invariants that are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination:\n\n1. `x % 2 == 0`\n2. `y % 2 == 0`\n3. `x >= 0`\n4. `y >= 0`\n5. `x < 99`\n6. `y < 99`\n\nThese loop invariants are true before the loop execution because the variables `x` and `y` are initialized to 0 and 1, respectively, and the loop condition `x < 99` is true.\n\nThese loop invariants are true in every iteration of the loop because the loop body updates `x` and `y` in a way that preserves their parity. Specifically, the loop body increments `x` by 2 if `y` is even, and decrements `x` by 2 if `y` is odd. This means that the parity of `x` and `y` remains the same in every iteration of the loop.\n\nFinally, these loop invariants are true after the loop termination because the loop condition `x < 99` is no longer true, so the loop must have terminated. This means that the final values of `x` and `y` must satisfy the loop invariants.\n\nTherefore, the necessary loop invariants for the loop in the program above are:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant x % 2 == 0;\n    loop invariant y % 2 == 0;\n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n    loop invariant x < 99;\n    loop invariant y < 99;\n*/\n```"
