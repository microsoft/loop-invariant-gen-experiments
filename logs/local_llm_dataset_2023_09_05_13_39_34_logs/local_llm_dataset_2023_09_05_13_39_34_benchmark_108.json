We can start by making a note of the properties that are true before the loop execution.\n\n* `n` is greater than 0, so the loop will execute at least once.\n* `f1`, `f2`, `g1`, and `g2` are initialized to 0, 1, 1, and 0, respectively.\n* `h1` and `h2` are initialized to 0 and 1, respectively.\n\nNext, we need to identify the properties that are true in every iteration of the loop. We can start by making a note of the properties that are modified in the loop body.\n\n* `f1`, `f2`, `g1`, and `g2` are modified in the loop body.\n* `h1` and `h2` are modified in the loop body.\n\nNext, we need to identify the properties that are true after the loop termination. We can start by making a note of the properties that are true after the loop termination.\n\n* `n` is equal to 0, so the loop will terminate.\n* `f1`, `f2`, `g1`, and `g2` are equal to 0, 1, 1, and 0, respectively.\n* `h1` and `h2` are equal to 0 and 1, respectively.\n\nFinally, we need to identify the loop invariants that imply the post-condition. The post-condition is `h2==h1+f1`. We can start by making a note of the properties that are true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop.\n\n* `h2` is equal to `h1+f1` before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop.\n* `f1` and `g1` are equal to 0 and 1, respectively, before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop.\n\nBased on the analysis above, we can identify the following loop invariants that imply the post-condition:\n\n* `h2==h1+f1` before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop.\n* `f1` and `g1` are equal to 0 and 1, respectively, before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the while loop in the program are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant h2==h1+f1;\n    loop invariant f1==0 && g1==1;\n*/\n```"
