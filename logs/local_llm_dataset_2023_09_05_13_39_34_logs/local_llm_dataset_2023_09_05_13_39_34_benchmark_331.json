This statement increments the value of `x` by 1 in each iteration of the loop.\n\nThe loop condition is `x<10`. This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as `x` is less than 10.\n\nTo find the loop invariants, we need to identify the values of the variables that remain unchanged throughout the loop execution. In this case, the only variable that is modified in the loop body is `x`. Therefore, the loop invariant should be related to the value of `x`.\n\nThe loop invariant can be expressed as follows:\n```\n/*@\n  loop invariant x >= 0;\n*/\n```\nThis loop invariant states that the value of `x` is greater than or equal to 0 in every iteration of the loop. This is because the loop body only increments the value of `x` by 1, and the loop condition checks whether `x` is less than 10. Therefore, the value of `x` will always be greater than or equal to 0 in every iteration of the loop.\n\nThe loop invariant can be further strengthened by adding the condition that `x` is less than 10. This can be done as follows:\n```\n/*@\n  loop invariant x >= 0 && x < 10;\n*/\n```\nThis loop invariant states that the value of `x` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than 10 in every iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the value of `x` will always be greater than or equal to 0 and less than 10 in every iteration of the loop.\n\nThe loop invariants can be used to verify the post-condition of the loop, which is `x==10`. The post-condition states that the value of `x` is equal to 10 after the loop execution. This can be verified by checking that the loop invariants hold true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nTherefore, the necessary loop invariants for the while loop in the given program are:\n```\n/*@\n  loop invariant x >= 0 && x < 10;\n*/\n```\nThese loop invariants can be used to verify the post-condition of the loop, which is `x==10`."
