Therefore, we can say that `x` is not equal to 0 before and after the loop.\n\nFinally, let's look at the post-condition. The post-condition is `y == -z`. This means that the value of `y` is equal to the negative of the value of `z`. Since `z` is an integer, this means that `y` is an integer as well.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can say that the following loop invariants are true:\n\n1. `x >= 0`: `x` is greater than or equal to 0 before and after the loop.\n2. `y >= 2`: `y` is greater than or equal to 2 before and after the loop.\n3. `z >= 1`: `z` is greater than or equal to 1 before and after the loop.\n4. `x != 0`: `x` is not equal to 0 before and after the loop.\n\nTherefore, we can write the loop invariants as follows:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant y >= 2;\n    loop invariant z >= 1;\n    loop invariant x != 0;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have not used any variables or functions that are not declared in the program, and we have not made any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given. Additionally, we have not used any keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops."

            "content": " To find the loop invariants, we need to analyze the loop body and the loop condition.\n\nThe loop condition is `x != 0`, which means the loop will continue to execute as long as `x` is not equal to 0.\n\nThe loop body contains three statements:\n```scss\nx --;\ny -= 2;\nz ++;\n```\nFrom this, we can see that `x` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, `y` is decremented by 2 in each iteration, and `z` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.\n\nNow, let's think about the loop invariants. A loop invariant is a condition that is true before the loop starts, and remains true after each iteration of the loop. In other words, it is a condition that is true at the beginning and end of each iteration of the loop.\n\nIn this case, we can identify two loop invariants:\n\n1. `x >= 0`: This is true because `x` is initialized to a non-negative value, and is decremented by 1 in each iteration.\n2. `y >= -z`: This is true because `y` is initialized to a non-negative value, and is decremented by 2 in each iteration, while `z` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.\n\nSo, the loop invariants for the loop in the program are:\n```scss\n/*@\n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant y >= -z;\n*/\n```\nNote that these loop invariants do not imply the post-condition `y == -z`, but they are necessary for the post-condition to be true."
