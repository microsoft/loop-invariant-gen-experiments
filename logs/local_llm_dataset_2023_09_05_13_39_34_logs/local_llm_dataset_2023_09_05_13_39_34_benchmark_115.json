Before the loop execution, `i` is equal to 0, `a` is equal to 0, `b` is equal to 0, and `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to `LARGE_INT`.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, `i` is less than `n`, `a` is less than or equal to `n`, `b` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to `LARGE_INT`.\n3. After the loop termination, `i` is equal to `n`, `a` is equal to `n`, `b` is equal to `n`, and `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to `LARGE_INT`.\n\nWe can express these loop invariants using ACSL annotations as follows:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant i == 0 && a == 0 && b == 0 && n >= 0 && n <= LARGE_INT;\n    loop invariant i < n && a <= n && b <= n && n >= 0 && n <= LARGE_INT;\n    loop invariant i == n && a == n && b == n && n >= 0 && n <= LARGE_INT;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used the `loop invariant` keyword to specify the loop invariants, and the `&&` operator to combine multiple conditions. We have also used the `==` operator to check for equality, and the `<=` operator to check for less than or equal to."

            "content": " To find the loop invariants for the while loop in the given program, we need to analyze the loop body and the loop condition.\n\nLoop Body:\nThe loop body contains two if-else statements. In the first if-statement, the variable `a` is incremented by 1, and the variable `b` is incremented by 2. In the else statement, the variable `a` is incremented by 2, and the variable `b` is incremented by 1.\n\nLoop Condition:\nThe loop condition is `i < n`. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop, and it is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. The variable `n` is a user-defined value that is read from the input.\n\nLoop Invariants:\nTo ensure that the loop terminates, we need to specify loop invariants that are true before the loop, during each iteration of the loop, and after the loop. Let's consider each of these cases separately:\n\n1. Before the loop:\nThe variable `i` is initialized to 0, and the variable `a` and `b` are initialized to 0.\n2. During each iteration of the loop:\nThe variable `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, and the variables `a` and `b` are incremented by 1 or 2 depending on the value of `unknown_int()`.\n3. After the loop:\nThe variable `i` is equal to `n`, and the variables `a` and `b` are equal to `3*n`.\n\nLoop Invariants:\nBased on the above analysis, we can specify the following loop invariants:\n\n1. Before the loop:\n`i == 0` and `a == 0` and `b == 0`\n2. During each iteration of the loop:\n`i < n` and `a + b == 3*i`\n3. After the loop:\n`i == n` and `a + b == 3*n`\n\nNote that these loop invariants are not exhaustive, and there may be other loop invariants that can be specified based on the specific requirements of the program. However, these loop invariants should be sufficient to help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program."
