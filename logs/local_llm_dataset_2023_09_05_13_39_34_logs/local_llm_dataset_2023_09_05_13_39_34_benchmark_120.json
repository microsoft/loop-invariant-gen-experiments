Loop Body:\nThe loop body contains several statements that modify the values of `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w`. The statements can be summarized as follows:\n* If `unknown_int()` returns a non-zero value, `x` is incremented by 1 and `y` is incremented by 100.\n* If `unknown_int()` returns a zero value, `x` is incremented by 1 and `y` is incremented by 1.\n* If `y` is greater than 10 times `w` and `z` is greater than 100 times `x`, `y` is set to the negative of its current value.\n* `w` is incremented by 1 and `z` is incremented by 10.\n3. Loop Invariants:\nBased on the loop body and the loop condition, we can identify the following loop invariants:\n* Before the loop execution, `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w` are all initialized to 0.\n* In every iteration of the loop, `x` is incremented by 1 and `y` is incremented by either 100 or 1, depending on the value returned by `unknown_int()`.\n* `w` is incremented by 1 in every iteration of the loop.\n* `z` is incremented by 10 in every iteration of the loop.\n* If `y` is greater than 10 times `w` and `z` is greater than 100 times `x`, `y` is set to the negative of its current value.\n* After the loop termination, `x` is greater than or equal to 4 and `y` is less than or equal to 2.\n\nHere are the loop invariants in ACSL notation:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n    loop invariant i3;\n    loop invariant i4;\n    loop invariant i5;\n    loop invariant i6;\n    loop invariant i7;\n*/\n```\nNote that the loop invariants are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination."

To find the necessary loop invariants for Frama-C to verify the post-condition, we need to analyze the loop body and the loop condition.\n\nFirst, let's identify the pre-conditions and variable assignments in the program:\n\n* The pre-conditions are:\n\t+ `unknown_int()` returns a non-zero value.\n\t+ `unknown_int()` returns a value less than or equal to 10000.\n* The variable assignments are:\n\t+ `x = y = z = w = 0`\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body:\n\n* The loop body has three branches:\n\t+ The first branch increments `x` and `y` by 100 and 1 respectively, when `unknown_int()` returns a non-zero value.\n\t+ The second branch increments `x` and `y` by 1 and 10 respectively, when `unknown_int()` returns a non-zero value and `x >= 4`.\n\t+ The third branch sets `y` to -`y`, when `y > 10*w` and `z >= 100*x`.\n* The loop condition is `unknown_int() && y < 10000`.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can identify the following loop invariants:\n\n* Before the loop execution, we have `x = y = z = w = 0`.\n* In every iteration of the loop, we have `x >= 0` and `y >= 0`.\n* After the loop termination, we have `x >= 4` and `y <= 2`.\n\nThese loop invariants imply the post-condition `x >= 4 && y <= 2`, which is the desired property to be verified by Frama-C.\n\nHere is the ACSL annotation for the loop:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n    loop invariant x >= 4;\n    loop invariant y <= 2;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have not used any variables or functions that are not declared in the program, and we have not made any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.

Loop Invariant (Before Loop Execution):\nThe loop invariant before the loop execution is \"x = 0 && y = 0 && z = 0 && w = 0\". This invariant is true because the variables are initialized to 0 before the loop starts.\n2. Loop Invariant (In Every Iteration):\nThe loop invariant in every iteration is \"y < 10000\". This invariant is true because the loop condition is \"unknown_int() && y < 10000\", and the loop body does not modify the value of y.\n3. Loop Invariant (After Loop Termination):\nThe loop invariant after the loop termination is \"x >= 4 && y <= 2\". This invariant is true because the loop body ensures that x is incremented by at least 4 in every iteration, and y is decremented by at most 2 in every iteration.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the loop in the program are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x = 0 && y = 0 && z = 0 && w = 0;\n    loop invariant y < 10000;\n    loop invariant x >= 4 && y <= 2;\n*/\n```"

To find the loop invariants, we need to analyze the loop body and the loop condition.\n\nStep 1: Identify the loop condition\nThe loop condition is `unknown_int() && y < 10000`. This condition is true while the `unknown_int()` function returns a non-zero value and `y` is less than 10000.\n\nStep 2: Identify the loop body\nThe loop body consists of several if-else statements. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n* `x = x + 1; y = y + 100;` increments `x` by 1 and `y` by 100.\n* `x = x + 1; y = y + 1;` increments `x` by 1 and `y` by 1.\n* `y = -y;` negates `y`.\n* `w = w + 1; z = z + 10;` increments `w` by 1 and `z` by 10.\n\nStep 3: Identify the loop invariants\nBased on the analysis of the loop body, we can identify the following loop invariants:\n\n* `x` is incremented by 1 in every iteration of the loop.\n* `y` is incremented by 100 in every iteration of the loop.\n* `z` is incremented by 10 in every iteration of the loop.\n* `w` is incremented by 1 in every iteration of the loop.\n* `x` is greater than or equal to 4 in every iteration of the loop.\n* `y` is less than or equal to 2 in every iteration of the loop.\n\nStep 4: Verify the post-condition\nThe post-condition is `x >= 4 && y <= 2`. We can verify that this post-condition is satisfied by the loop invariants. Therefore, the loop invariants imply the post-condition.\n\nStep 5: Output the loop invariants\nThe loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x == x + 1;\n    loop invariant y == y + 100;\n    loop invariant z == z + 10;\n    loop invariant w == w + 1;\n    loop invariant x >= 4;\n    loop invariant y <= 2;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have split the conjunction of loop invariants into its parts."
