The loop condition is x < 1000000.\n\nNow, let's think about the loop invariants:\n\n1. Before the loop execution, we can say that x = 0 and y = 500000. These are the initial values of x and y, respectively.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, we can say that x < 1000000 and y = 500000. This is because the loop condition is x < 1000000, and the loop body only increments x by 1 or 2.\n3. After the loop termination, we can say that x = 1000000 and y = 1000000. This is because the loop body increments x and y by 1 or 2, respectively, until x reaches 1000000.\n\nNow, let's write the loop invariants in the ACSL notation:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n    loop invariant i3;\n    loop invariant i4;\n*/\n```\nHere, i1 is the loop invariant that x = 0 and y = 500000 before the loop execution.\ni2 is the loop invariant that x < 1000000 and y = 500000 in every iteration of the loop.\ni3 is the loop invariant that x = 1000000 and y = 1000000 after the loop termination.\ni4 is the loop invariant that y != x after the loop termination.\n\nNote that we have split the loop invariant into four parts to make it easier to understand. However, we can also combine them into a single loop invariant by using a conjunction (e.g., i1 && i2 && i3 && i4)."

Loop Body:\nThe loop body consists of two branches:\n\t* If `x < 500000`, then `x` is incremented by 1.\n\t* Otherwise, `x` is incremented by 1 and `y` is incremented by 1.\n2. Loop Condition:\nThe loop condition is `x < 1000000`.\n\nBased on the loop body and the loop condition, we can identify the following loop invariants:\n\n1. Before the loop execution, the value of `x` is 0 and the value of `y` is 500000.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, the value of `x` is less than 1000000.\n3. After the loop termination, the value of `y` is not equal to the value of `x`.\n\nHere are the loop invariants in ACSL notation:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant x == 0 && y == 500000;\n    loop invariant x < 1000000;\n    loop invariant y != x;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have not used any variables or functions that are not declared in the program, and we have not made any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given. Additionally, we have not used any keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops."
