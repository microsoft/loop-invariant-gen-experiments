Loop Body:\nThe loop body consists of two statements:\n\t* `glob3_dc++;`\n\t* `if(glob3_dc <= -1 || glob3_dc >= MAXPATHLEN + 1)`: This statement checks if `glob3_dc` is less than or equal to -1 or greater than or equal to `MAXPATHLEN + 1`.

This condition checks if the sum of `glob3_pathend_off` and `glob3_dc` is greater than or equal to `glob3_pathlim_off`. If this condition is true, the loop will continue.\n\nTo ensure that the loop terminates, we need to ensure that the loop condition becomes false eventually. We can do this by ensuring that `glob3_pathend_off` and `glob3_pathlim_off` are not equal, and that `glob3_dc` is not equal to -1 or `MAXPATHLEN + 1`.\n\nTherefore, the necessary loop invariants are:\n\n1. `glob3_pathend_off != glob3_pathlim_off`\n2. `glob3_dc != -1`\n3. `glob3_dc != MAXPATHLEN + 1`\n\nThese loop invariants ensure that the loop condition becomes false eventually, which in turn ensures that the loop terminates.\n\nHere is the complete loop invariant code block:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant glob3_pathend_off != glob3_pathlim_off;\n    loop invariant glob3_dc != -1;\n    loop invariant glob3_dc != MAXPATHLEN + 1;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have not used any variables or functions that are not declared in the program, and we have not made any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given. We have also ensured that all undefined variables contain garbage values, and we have not used any keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops."
