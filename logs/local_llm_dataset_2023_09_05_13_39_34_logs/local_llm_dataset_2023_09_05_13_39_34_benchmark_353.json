The loop body contains two conditional statements:\n\t* If `x < 0`, then `x = x + 7`.\n\t* Else, `x = x + 10`.\n\t* If `y < 0`, then `y = y - 10`.\n\t* Else, `y = y + 3`.\n3. The loop invariants must be true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nBased on the analysis above, we can identify the following loop invariants:\n\n1. `x < y`: This is the loop condition, and it must be true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n2. `x >= 0` and `y >= 0`: These are the conditions for the two conditional statements in the loop body. They must be true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n3. `x <= y + 16`: This is the post-condition of the loop, and it must be true after the loop termination.\n\nHere are the loop invariants in ACSL notation:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x < y;\n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n    loop invariant x <= y + 16;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have not used any variables or functions that are not declared in the program, and we have not made any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given. Additionally, we have not used any non-deterministic function calls or the `\\at(x, Pre)` notation."

Pre-condition:\nThe pre-condition for the loop is `x < y`. This means that the loop will iterate while `x` is less than `y`.\n2. Loop condition:\nThe loop condition is `x < y`. This means that the loop will continue to iterate as long as `x` is less than `y`.\n3. Loop body:\nThe loop body consists of two if-else statements. The first if-else statement checks if `x` is less than 0, and if so, it adds 7 to `x`. Otherwise, it adds 10 to `x`. The second if-else statement checks if `y` is less than 0, and if so, it subtracts 10 from `y`. Otherwise, it adds 3 to `y`.\n4. Post-condition:\nThe post-condition for the loop is `x >= y && x <= y + 16`. This means that after the loop terminates, `x` must be greater than or equal to `y`, and `x` must be less than or equal to `y` plus 16.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can identify the following loop invariants:\n\n1. Loop invariant 1: `x < y`\nThis loop invariant is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. It ensures that the loop will continue to iterate as long as `x` is less than `y`.\n2. Loop invariant 2: `x >= y`\nThis loop invariant is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. It ensures that `x` will always be greater than or equal to `y` after the loop terminates.\n3. Loop invariant 3: `x <= y + 16`\nThis loop invariant is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. It ensures that `x` will always be less than or equal to `y` plus 16 after the loop terminates.\n\nTherefore, the necessary loop invariants for the while loop to help Frama-C verify the post-condition are:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant x < y;\n    loop invariant x >= y;\n    loop invariant x <= y + 16;\n*/\n```"

The loop body consists of two if-else statements. The first if-else statement checks if `x` is less than 0, and if so, sets `x` to `x + 7`. The second if-else statement checks if `y` is less than 0, and if so, sets `y` to `y - 10`.\n2. The loop condition checks if `x` is less than `y`.\n3. The loop body modifies the values of `x` and `y`.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can identify the following loop invariants:\n\n1. Before the loop execution, `x` and `y` are initialized to some values.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, `x` and `y` are modified based on the if-else statements in the loop body.\n3. After the loop termination, `x` and `y` have specific values that satisfy the post-condition.\n\nHere are the loop invariants in ACSL notation:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant x >= 0 && y >= 0;\n    loop invariant x < y || x >= y + 16;\n    loop invariant x + y >= 0 && x + y <= 26;\n@*/\n```\nNote that the first loop invariant ensures that `x` and `y` are non-negative, which is necessary for the post-condition to hold. The second loop invariant ensures that `x` is less than `y` or `x` is greater than or equal to `y + 16`, which is necessary for the post-condition to hold. The third loop invariant ensures that `x + y` is non-negative and less than or equal to 26, which is necessary for the post-condition to hold."
