After the loop termination, `x` is equal to `N`.\n\nBased on these observations, we can deduce the following loop invariants:\n\n1. Before the loop execution, `x` is equal to 0.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, `x` is incremented by 2.\n3. After the loop termination, `x` is equal to `N`.\n\nThese loop invariants imply the post-condition `x % 2 == 0`, which is the desired property that we want to verify.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the while loop in the program are:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant x == 0;\n    loop invariant x % 2 == 0;\n    loop invariant x < N;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have assumed that `N` is a constant value that is unknown at compile time. If `N` is a variable that can change at runtime, we would need to modify the loop invariants accordingly."
