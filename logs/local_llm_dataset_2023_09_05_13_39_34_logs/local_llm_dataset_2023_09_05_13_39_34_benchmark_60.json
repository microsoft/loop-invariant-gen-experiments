To find the loop invariants, we need to analyze the loop body and the loop condition.\n\nLoop Body:\nThe loop body contains several statements, including variable assignments and a call to `__BLAST_NONDET`. We can ignore the call to `__BLAST_NONDET` for now, as it is not relevant to the loop invariants.\n\nThe variable assignments in the loop body are:\n\n* `glob3_dc = 0`\n* `glob3_dc++`\n\nThe loop condition is `glob3_pathend_off + glob3_dc >= glob3_pathlim_off`.\n\nLoop Invariants:\nBased on the analysis of the loop body and the loop condition, we can identify the following loop invariants:\n\n1. `glob3_dc` is a non-negative integer.\n2. `glob3_dc` is less than or equal to `MAXPATHLEN + 1`.\n3. `glob3_pathend_off + glob3_dc` is less than or equal to `glob3_pathlim_off`.\n\nTo prove that these loop invariants imply the post-condition, we need to show that the post-condition is true whenever the loop invariants are true.\n\nPost-Condition:\nThe post-condition is `glob3_pathend_off + glob3_dc >= glob3_pathlim_off`.\n\nImplication:\nIf the loop invariants are true, then we can conclude that `glob3_pathend_off + glob3_dc` is less than or equal to `glob3_pathlim_off`. Therefore, the post-condition is true, and the loop invariants imply the post-condition.\n\nOutput:\nThe loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant 1 <= glob3_dc;\n    loop invariant glob3_dc <= MAXPATHLEN + 1;\n    loop invariant glob3_pathend_off + glob3_dc <= glob3_pathlim_off;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have split the conjunction of the loop invariants into its individual parts, as required by the instructions."
