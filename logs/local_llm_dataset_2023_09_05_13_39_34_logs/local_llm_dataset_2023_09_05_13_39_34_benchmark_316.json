Loop Body:\nThe loop body contains three statements:\n* `c=c+i;`\n* `i=i+1;`\n* `if (i<=0) break;`\n\nThe first two statements update the values of `c` and `i`, respectively. The third statement checks if `i` is less than or equal to 0 and breaks the loop if it is.\n\n1. Loop Condition:\nThe loop condition is `i<100`.\n\nNow, let's find the loop invariants:\n\n1. Loop Invariant (Before Loop Execution):\nBefore the loop is executed, the following conditions are true:\n* `i` is a non-negative integer (since it is initialized to `unknown_int()`)\n* `c` is a non-negative integer (since it is initialized to `unknown_int()`)\n\n2. Loop Invariant (In Every Iteration of the Loop):\nIn every iteration of the loop, the following conditions are true:\n* `i` is less than or equal to 100 (since the loop condition is `i<100`)\n* `c` is greater than or equal to 0 (since it is initialized to `unknown_int()` and the loop body updates it with `c=c+i`, which is always non-negative)\n\n3. Loop Invariant (After Loop Termination):\nAfter the loop is terminated, the following conditions are true:\n* `i` is greater than or equal to 0 (since the loop condition is `i<100` and the loop body updates `i` with `i=i+1`, which is always non-negative)\n* `c` is greater than or equal to 0 (since it is initialized to `unknown_int()` and the loop body updates it with `c=c+i`, which is always non-negative)\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the loop in the program are:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant i>=0;\n    loop invariant c>=0;\n    loop invariant i<=100;\n    loop invariant c+i>=0;\n*/\n```\nThese loop invariants imply the post-condition `c>=0`, since `c` is initialized to `unknown_int()` and the loop body updates it with `c=c+i`, which is always non-negative."
