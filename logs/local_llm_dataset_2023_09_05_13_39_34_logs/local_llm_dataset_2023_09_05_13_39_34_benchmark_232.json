Also, the loop invariants do not make any assumptions about the behavior of the function `unknown()`."

Pre-condition:\nThe pre-condition for the loop is \"unknown()\". This means that the loop will execute as long as the function \"unknown()\" returns a non-zero value.\n2. Loop body:\nThe loop body consists of several if-else statements that check the value of the variable \"s\". Depending on the value of \"s\", the loop either sets \"e\" to a specific value or increments \"s\".\n3. Loop condition:\nThe loop condition is \"unknown()\". This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as the function \"unknown()\" returns a non-zero value.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can identify the following loop invariants:\n\n1. Before the loop execution:\nThe variable \"e\" is initialized to 0, and the variable \"s\" is initialized to 2.\n2. In every iteration of the loop:\nThe variable \"s\" is either 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n3. After the loop termination:\nThe variable \"e\" is either 1, 2, or 3.\n\nThese loop invariants imply the post-condition \"e == 3\" because if the loop terminates, then \"e\" must be equal to 3.\n\nHere are the loop invariants in ACSL notation:\n```\n/*@\n  loop invariant e == 0 \\/ e == 1 \\/ e == 2;\n  loop invariant s == 2 \\/ s == 3 \\/ s == 4 \\/ s == 5;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used the \"\\/\" operator to represent the \"or\" relationship between the loop invariants."
