Loop Body:\nThe loop body consists of two if-else statements. The first if-else statement updates the values of `a` and `b` based on the result of `unknown_int()`. The second if-else statement updates the value of `i` by adding 1 to it.\n2. Loop Condition:\nThe loop condition is `i < n`. This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.\n3. Loop Invariants:\nBased on the analysis of the loop body and the loop condition, we can identify the following loop invariants:\n\na. `a` and `b` are both non-negative integers.\nb. `i` is a non-negative integer that is less than `n`.\nc. `a + b` is equal to `3 * n`.\n\nThese loop invariants are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. The loop invariants imply the post-condition, which is `a + b == 3 * n`.\n\nHere is the loop invariant code block:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant a >= 0 && b >= 0;\n    loop invariant i >= 0 && i < n;\n    loop invariant a + b == 3 * n;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used the `assume` macro to check for the pre-conditions and the loop invariants. We have also used the `assert` macro to check for the post-condition. The `assume` and `assert` macros are defined in the ACSL annotations for loops."
