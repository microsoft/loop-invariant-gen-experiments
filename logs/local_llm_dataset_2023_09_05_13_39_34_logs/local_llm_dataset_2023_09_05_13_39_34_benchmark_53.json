So, the loop invariant that is true in every iteration of the loop is:\n```\nx == y * 2\n```\nFinally, let's think about the loop invariant that is true after the loop termination. We can see that the loop terminates when `__BLAST_NONDET` is false. So, the loop invariant that is true after the loop termination is:\n```\n__BLAST_NONDET == false\n```\nPutting it all together, we have the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x == 0 && y == 0;\n    loop invariant x == y * 2;\n    loop invariant __BLAST_NONDET == false;\n*/\n```\nThese loop invariants imply the post-condition `x < 4`, since the loop terminates when `x` is greater than or equal to 4."

            "content": " To find the loop invariants for the while loop in the given program, we need to analyze the loop body and the loop condition.\n\nLoop Body:\nThe loop body consists of two statements: `x += 2;` and `y += 2;`. These statements increment `x` and `y` by 2 in each iteration of the loop.\n\nLoop Condition:\nThe loop condition is `__BLAST_NONDET`, which is a non-deterministic function call. This means that the loop can terminate at any point, and the value of `__BLAST_NONDET` is not known beforehand.\n\nLoop Invariants:\nTo verify the post-condition of the loop, we need to find loop invariants that are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nBefore the loop execution, the loop invariants should include the pre-conditions of the program, which are `0 <= x` and `x <= 2`, and `0 <= y` and `y <= 2`. These pre-conditions ensure that `x` and `y` are within the valid range of values before the loop starts.\n\nIn every iteration of the loop, the loop invariants should include the loop condition `__BLAST_NONDET`, which ensures that the loop can terminate at any point. Additionally, the loop invariants should include the statements in the loop body, which are `x += 2;` and `y += 2;`. These statements ensure that `x` and `y` are incremented by 2 in each iteration of the loop.\n\nAfter the loop termination, the loop invariants should include the post-condition of the loop, which is `x < 4`. This post-condition ensures that `x` is less than 4 after the loop terminates.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the while loop in the given program are:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant 0 <= x;\n    loop invariant x <= 2;\n    loop invariant 0 <= y;\n    loop invariant y <= 2;\n    loop invariant __BLAST_NONDET;\n    loop invariant x += 2;\n    loop invariant y += 2;\n    loop invariant x < 4;\n@*/\n```\nThese loop invariants are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. They ensure that the loop executes correctly and verifies the post-condition of the loop."
