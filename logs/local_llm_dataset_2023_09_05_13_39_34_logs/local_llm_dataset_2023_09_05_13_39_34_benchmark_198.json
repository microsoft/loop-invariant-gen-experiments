Before the loop execution:\nThe loop invariant before the loop execution is that `input` is non-zero.\n2. In every iteration of the loop:\nThe loop invariant in every iteration of the loop is that `x1p`, `x2p`, and `x3p` are assigned values, and `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` are updated accordingly.\n3. After the loop termination:\nThe loop invariant after the loop termination is that `x1` is less than or equal to `x2`, and `x2` is greater than or equal to 0, or `x2 - x3` is less than or equal to 2.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the while loop in the program are:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant input != 0;\n    loop invariant x1p = unknown_int();\n    loop invariant x2p = unknown_int();\n    loop invariant x3p = unknown_int();\n    loop invariant x1 = x1p;\n    loop invariant x2 = x2p;\n    loop invariant x3 = x3p;\n    loop invariant x1 <= x2 && (x2 >= 0 || x2 - x3 <= 2);\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used the `unknown_int()` function to represent the values of `x1p`, `x2p`, and `x3p`, as their values are unknown before the loop execution."

A loop invariant is a condition that is true before the loop starts, is maintained during the loop iterations, and is true after the loop terminates.\n\nLet's start by looking at the pre-conditions of the loop. The pre-conditions are the conditions that are true before the loop starts. In this case, the pre-conditions are:\n\n* `input` is not equal to 0\n* `x1` is equal to 0\n* `x2` is equal to 0\n* `x3` is equal to 0\n\nNext, let's look at the loop condition. The loop condition is the condition that is checked at the beginning of each loop iteration. In this case, the loop condition is:\n\n* `input` is not equal to 0\n\nNow, let's look at the loop body. The loop body is the code that is executed during each loop iteration. In this case, the loop body is:\n\n```\nx1p = unknown_int();\nx2p = unknown_int();\nx3p = unknown_int();\n\nif (x1p <= x2p && (x2p >= 0 || x2p - x3p <= 2))\n{\n    x1 = x1p;\n    x2 = x2p;\n    x3 = x3p;\n}\ninput = unknown_int();\n```\nThe loop body assigns new values to `x1p`, `x2p`, and `x3p`, and then checks if the condition `x1p <= x2p && (x2p >= 0 || x2p - x3p <= 2)` is true. If the condition is true, the loop body assigns the new values to `x1`, `x2`, and `x3`.\n\nNow, let's look at the loop invariants. The loop invariants are the conditions that are true before the loop starts, are maintained during the loop iterations, and are true after the loop terminates. In this case, the loop invariants are:\n\n* `input` is not equal to 0\n* `x1` is equal to 0\n* `x2` is equal to 0\n* `x3` is equal to 0\n\nWe can see that the loop invariants are the same as the pre-conditions, which means that the loop invariants are also the post-conditions. This means that the loop is guaranteed to terminate, and the final values of `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` are guaranteed to be equal to 0.\n\nFinally, let's look at the post-condition.

In this case, the post-condition is:\n\n* `x1` is equal to 0\n* `x2` is equal to 0\n* `x3` is equal to 0\n\nWe can see that the post-condition is the same as the loop invariants, which means that the post-condition is also the loop invariants.
