            "content": " To find the loop invariants for the loop in the given C program, we need to follow the steps outlined in the instructions.\n\nStep 1: Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n\nIn this case, the pre-conditions are the following:\n\n* `x`, `y`, and `z` are all initialized to `unknown_int()` values.\n* `x`, `y`, and `z` are all different from each other.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition.\n\nThe loop body increments `x`, `y`, and `z` by 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The loop condition is `unknown_bool()`.\n\nStep 3: Output loop invariants that are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination, such that the loop invariants imply the post condition.\n\nThe loop invariants for this loop are:\n\n* `x` is equal to `y` before the loop execution.\n* `x` is greater than or equal to 0 before the loop execution.\n* `x` plus `y` plus `z` is equal to 0 before the loop execution.\n* `x` is equal to `y` in every iteration of the loop.\n* `x` is greater than or equal to 0 in every iteration of the loop.\n* `x` plus `y` plus `z` is equal to 0 in every iteration of the loop.\n* `x` is equal to `y` after the loop termination.\n* `x` is greater than or equal to 0 after the loop termination.\n* `x` plus `y` plus `z` is equal to 0 after the loop termination.\n\nNote that these loop invariants are conjunctions of the following conditions:\n\n* `x` is equal to `y`\n* `x` is greater than or equal to 0\n* `x` plus `y` plus `z` is equal to 0\n\nWe can split these conjunctions into their parts to get the individual loop invariants.\n\nHere is the output code block with the loop invariants:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant x == y;\n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant x + y + z == 0;\n*/\n```\nNote that we are using the `@` symbol to indicate that the following code is an ACSL annotation. The `loop invariant` keyword is used to specify the loop invariant condition. The `x == y`, `x >= 0`, and `x + y + z == 0` conditions are the loop invariants that we have derived from the program."
