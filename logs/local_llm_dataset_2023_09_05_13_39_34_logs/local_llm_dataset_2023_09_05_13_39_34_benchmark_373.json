            "content": " To find the loop invariants for the while loop in the program, we need to analyze the loop body and the loop condition.\n\nLoop Body:\nThe loop body consists of two if-else statements. The first if-else statement increments x by 1 if the condition is true, and the second if-else statement decrements x by 1 and z by 1 if the condition is false.\n\nLoop Condition:\nThe loop condition is x < 100 && 100 < z. This condition is true when x is less than 100 and z is greater than 100.\n\nLoop Invariants:\nThe loop invariants are the conditions that are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nBefore the loop execution:\n\n* x is initialized to a value between 0 and 99 (inclusive).\n* y is initialized to a value between 0 and 99 (inclusive).\n* z is initialized to a value between 100 and 199 (inclusive).\n\nIn every iteration of the loop:\n\n* x is less than 100.\n* z is greater than 100.\n* The difference between x and z is less than or equal to the difference between x and y.\n\nAfter the loop termination:\n\n* x is equal to 100.\n* z is equal to 100.\n\nHere are the loop invariants in ACSL notation:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant x < 100;\n    loop invariant z > 100;\n    loop invariant x - z <= y - z;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used the variable y in the loop invariants, but it is not declared in the program. We have also used the assume() function to check if the loop condition is true, but the assume() function is not defined in the program. Therefore, we cannot use these loop invariants to verify the post-condition."
