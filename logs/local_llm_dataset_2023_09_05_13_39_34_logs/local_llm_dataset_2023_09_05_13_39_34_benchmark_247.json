The tenth loop invariant `i10` states that `y` is never equal to `19` or `20` in the loop body.\n\nThese loop invariants imply that `y` is equal to `6` after the loop terminates, which is the desired post-condition. Therefore, we have successfully found the loop invariants that imply the post-condition for the loop in the given program."
