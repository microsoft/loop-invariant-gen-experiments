A loop invariant is a condition that remains true before, during, and after the loop execution. In this case, we can identify two loop invariants:\n\n1. `sn` is equal to the sum of `a` and the previous value of `sn`. This is because the loop body updates `sn` by adding `a` to it, and the loop condition ensures that the loop will execute until `i` is greater than or equal to `n`.\n2. `i` is less than or equal to `n`. This is because the loop condition ensures that the loop will execute until `i` is greater than or equal to `n`.\n\nIn ACSL notation, we can express these loop invariants as follows:\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant sn == (sn + a);\n  loop invariant i <= n;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used the `loop invariant` keyword to indicate that these are loop invariants. We have also used the `==` operator to indicate that the left-hand side is equal to the right-hand side.\n\nFinally, we can use these loop invariants to verify the post-condition of the program. The post-condition is that `sn` is equal to `n*a` or `0`. We can use the loop invariants to prove that this post-condition is true.\n\nFor example, if `sn` is equal to `n*a`, then the loop body will execute until `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, and the loop condition will be true. Therefore, the post-condition is true.\n\nOn the other hand, if `sn` is equal to `0`, then the loop body will not execute, and the post-condition is still true.\n\nIn summary, the loop invariants for the loop in the program above are:\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant sn == (sn + a);\n  loop invariant i <= n;\n*/\n```\nThese loop invariants can be used to verify the post-condition of the program, which is that `sn` is equal to `n*a` or `0`."
