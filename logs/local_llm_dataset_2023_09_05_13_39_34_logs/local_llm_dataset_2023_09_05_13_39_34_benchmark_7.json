The first if-else statement increments x by 1 and y by 2 if the condition is true. The second if-else statement increments x by 1, y by 3, and z by 10, and w by 10 if the condition is true and x >= 4. The third if-else statement sets x to -x and y to -y if the condition is true and x >= z and w >= y+1.\n\nThe loop condition is unknown_int().\n\nBased on the loop body and the loop condition, we can identify the following loop invariants:\n\n1. x >= 0: This is true because x is initialized to 0, and the loop body only increments x by 1 or -x, which keeps it non-negative.\n2. y >= 0: This is true because y is initialized to 0, and the loop body only increments y by 2 or -y, which keeps it non-negative.\n3. z >= 0: This is true because z is initialized to 0, and the loop body only increments z by 10, which keeps it non-negative.\n4. w >= 0: This is true because w is initialized to 0, and the loop body only increments w by 10, which keeps it non-negative.\n5. x + y >= 3: This is true because the loop body only increments x by 1 or -x, and y by 2 or -y, which keeps the sum x + y non-negative.\n6. x + y <= 3: This is true because the loop body only increments x by 1 or -x, and y by 2 or -y, which keeps the sum x + y non-negative.\n7. z + w >= 0: This is true because the loop body only increments z by 10 and w by 10, which keeps the sum z + w non-negative.\n\nThese loop invariants are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination, which implies that the loop will terminate and the post-condition will be satisfied.\n\nNote that we have used the fact that unknown_int() is a non-deterministic function, which means that it can return any value between 0 and 1. This allows us to conclude that the loop will terminate with probability 1, and the post-condition will be satisfied."
