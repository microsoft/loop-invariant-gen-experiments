Loop Invariant 3:\nAfter the loop termination, the variable `x` is greater than or equal to 100.\n\n4. Loop Invariant 4:\nIn every iteration of the loop, the variable `z` is greater than or equal to 100.\n\n5. Loop Invariant 5:\nAfter the loop termination, the variable `z` is less than or equal to 100.\n\nThe loop invariants can be written as:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant x < 100;\n    loop invariant x < 100;\n    loop invariant x >= 100;\n    loop invariant z >= 100;\n    loop invariant z <= 100;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have split the loop invariant 1 into two parts, as it is a conjunction of two conditions.\n\nAlso, note that we have used the ACSL annotations for loops, which are supported by Frama-C. We have also followed the rules specified in the instructions, such as not using variables or functions that are not declared in the program, not making any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given, and not using keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops."

This condition checks if `x` is less than 100 and `z` is greater than 100.\n\nLoop Invariants:\nBased on the loop body and the loop condition, we can identify the following loop invariants:\n\n1. `x` is less than or equal to 100.\n2. `z` is greater than or equal to 100.\n3. `x` and `z` are both integers.\n\nNote that these loop invariants are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nHere's the code block with the loop invariants:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant x <= 100;\n    loop invariant z >= 100;\n    loop invariant x == z;\n@*/\n```\nThe first two loop invariants ensure that `x` and `z` are within the required range. The third loop invariant ensures that `x` and `z` are equal, which is necessary for the loop to terminate."
