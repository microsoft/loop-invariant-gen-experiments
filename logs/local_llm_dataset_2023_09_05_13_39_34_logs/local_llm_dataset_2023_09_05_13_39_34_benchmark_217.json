In this case, the loop condition uses `x1`, `x2`, and `x3`. Therefore, we can infer that `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` are loop invariants.\n\nAdditionally, we can also infer that `d1`, `d2`, and `d3` are loop invariants, as they are not modified in the loop body.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the given program are:\n\n* `x1`\n* `x2`\n* `x3`\n* `d1`\n* `d2`\n* `d3`\n\nNote that we have not used any variables or functions that are not declared in the program, and we have not made any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given. Also, we have not used any non-deterministic function calls or the `@` notation for any variable."
