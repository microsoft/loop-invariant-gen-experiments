During each iteration of the loop, the variable `unowned` must be greater than or equal to 0. This is ensured by the condition `if (! (unowned >= 0)) return 0;`.\n4. During each iteration of the loop, the variable `nonexclusive` must be greater than or equal to 0. This is ensured by the condition `if (! (nonexclusive >= 0)) return 0;`.\n5.

The first if-else statement checks if the variable `invalid` is greater than or equal to 1. If it is, it executes the code block that increments the `nonexclusive` variable, sets the `exclusive` variable to 0, and decrements the `invalid` variable. The second if-else statement checks if the variable `nonexclusive` is greater than or equal to 1. If it is, it executes the code block that increments the `exclusive` variable, sets the `nonexclusive` variable to 0, and decrements the `invalid` variable.

If it is, it executes the code block that increments the `exclusive` variable, sets the `unowned` variable to 0, and decrements the `invalid` variable.\n\nLoop Condition:\nThe loop condition is the expression `unknown_int()` at the beginning of the while loop.

After the loop termination, the variable `invalid` is greater than or equal to 1.\n\nNote that the loop invariants are not necessarily the only possible loop invariants, and the specific loop invariants used may depend on the specific requirements of the program."
