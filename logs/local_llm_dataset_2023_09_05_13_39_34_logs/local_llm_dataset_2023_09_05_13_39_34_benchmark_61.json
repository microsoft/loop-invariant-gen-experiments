The loop condition is `__BLAST_NONDET`, which is a non-deterministic function that returns either 0 or 1.\n\nFrom the loop body, we can see that the value of `x` is incremented by 1 in the first `if` statement, and the value of `y` is updated to be 100 more than its current value. In the second `if` statement, the value of `x` is incremented by 1 if it is greater than or equal to 4, and the value of `y` is updated to be 1 more than its current value. In the third `if` statement, the value of `z` is updated to be 100 more than its current value.\n\nThe loop condition is `__BLAST_NONDET`, which means that the loop may or may not terminate depending on the value of `__BLAST_NONDET`.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can identify the following loop invariants:\n\n1. Before the loop execution, the value of `x` is 0, the value of `y` is 0, the value of `z` is 0, and the value of `w` is 0.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, the value of `x` is incremented by 1, the value of `y` is updated to be 100 more than its current value, the value of `z` is updated to be 100 more than its current value, and the value of `w` is incremented by 1.\n3. After the loop termination, the value of `x` is greater than or equal to 4, the value of `y` is greater than or equal to 2, and the value of `z` is greater than or equal to 100.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the given program are:\n\n* Before the loop execution: `x == 0 && y == 0 && z == 0 && w == 0`\n* In every iteration of the loop: `x' == x + 1 && y' == y + 100 && z' == z + 100 && w' == w + 1`\n* After the loop termination: `x >= 4 && y >= 2 && z >= 100`\n\nNote that we have used the prime symbol (`'`) to indicate the updated value of the variables in the loop invariants."

It is a non-deterministic function call, and its value is not known beforehand.\n3. Loop body:\nThe loop body consists of four conditional statements:\n\t* `if (__BLAST_NONDET) { x++; y = y + 100; }`\n\t* `else if (__BLAST_NONDET) { if (x >= 4) { x = x + 1; y = y + 1; } }`\n\t* `else if (y > 10 * w) { if (z >= 100 * x) { y = -y; } }`\n\t* `w = w + 1; z = z + 10;`\n4.

Loop invariant (before loop execution):\nThere is no loop invariant before the loop execution.\n2. Loop invariant (in every iteration of the loop):\nThe loop invariant in every iteration of the loop is `y >= 100 * x`. It is because the loop body increments `y` by `100` if `x` is less than or equal to `4`, and it does not change `y` otherwise.\n3. Loop invariant (after loop termination):\nThe loop invariant after loop termination is `y > 2`. It is because the loop body increments `y` by `100` if `x` is less than or equal to `4`, and it does not change `y` otherwise. Therefore, if the loop terminates with `x >= 4`, then `y > 2`.\n\nHere are the loop invariants in ACSL annotations:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n    loop invariant i3;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have split the conjunction of loop invariants into its parts."
