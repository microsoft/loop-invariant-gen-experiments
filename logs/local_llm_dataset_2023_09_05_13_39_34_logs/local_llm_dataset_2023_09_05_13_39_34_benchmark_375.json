These loop invariants imply the post-condition `y <= 0 || (y < 0 && x >= 100)`, as we have `y > 0` and `x <= 100` in the loop invariants, which implies that `y` is non-negative, and `x` is less than or equal to 100.

We can write this as `x = x + y && x < 100`.\n\nThe loop invariant is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination, so we can use it to verify the post-condition. The post-condition is `y <= 0 || (y < 0 && x >= 100)`, which is true if `y` is less than or equal to 0, or if `y` is less than 0 and `x` is greater than or equal to 100.\n\nHere is the loop invariant in ACSL notation:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant x = x + y && x < 100;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used the `&&` operator to combine the two conditions of the loop invariant. This is because the loop invariant is a conjunction of the two conditions, and we want to express it in a way that is easy to understand and verify.\n\nAlso, note that we have not used any variables or functions that are not declared in the program, and we have not made any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given. We have also avoided using keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops."
