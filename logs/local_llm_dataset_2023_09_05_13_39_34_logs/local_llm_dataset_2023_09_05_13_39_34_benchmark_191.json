Pre-condition:\nThe pre-condition of the while loop is `x <= N`.\n2. Loop condition:\nThe loop condition is `x <= N`.\n3. Loop body:\nThe loop body consists of three statements: `y = N - x;`, `x++;`, and `v1 = v2; v2 = v3; v3 = v1;`.\n4. Post-condition:\nThe post-condition of the while loop is `v1 == v3`.\n\nNow, let's find the loop invariants that are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination, such that the loop invariants imply the post-condition.\n\n1. Loop invariant before loop execution:\nThere is no loop invariant before the loop execution.\n2. Loop invariant in every iteration of the loop:\nThe loop invariant in every iteration of the loop is `v1 == v3`. This is because the loop body assigns `v1 = v2;` and `v2 = v3;`, so `v1` and `v3` have the same value in every iteration.\n3. Loop invariant after loop termination:\nThe loop invariant after loop termination is `v1 == v3`. This is because the loop terminates when `x > N`, so `v1` and `v3` have the same value after the loop terminates.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the while loop in the given program are:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant v1 == v3;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have not used any variables or functions that are not declared in the program, and we have not made any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given. Additionally, we have not used any keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops."
