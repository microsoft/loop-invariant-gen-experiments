The new value of `y` is returned by the `unknown_int()` function.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop condition. The loop condition is `i<n`, where `n` is a variable that is assigned a value by the `unknown_int()` function. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.\n\nBased on the analysis of the loop body and the loop condition, we can identify the following loop invariants:\n\n1. `x` is always equal to `0` before the loop execution.\n2. `x` is always equal to `0` in every iteration of the loop.\n3. `x` is always equal to `0` after the loop termination.\n4. `y` is always equal to `0` before the loop execution.\n5. `y` is always equal to `0` in every iteration of the loop.\n6. `y` is always equal to `0` after the loop termination.\n\nThese loop invariants imply the post-condition of the loop, which is that `x` and `y` are both equal to `0` after the loop execution.\n\nTherefore, the necessary loop invariants for the loop in the program are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x==0;\n    loop invariant y==0;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have not used any variables or functions that are not declared in the program. We have also not made any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given. All undefined variables contain garbage values, and we have not used any variables that have garbage values. Finally, we have not used any keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops."
