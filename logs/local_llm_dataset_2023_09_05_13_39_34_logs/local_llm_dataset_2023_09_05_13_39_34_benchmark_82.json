Before the loop execution, `x` and `z` are initialized to some values, and `y` is unchanged.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, if `tmp` is true, then `x` is incremented by 1, otherwise `x` is decremented by 1 and `z` is decremented by 1.\n3. After the loop termination, `x` and `z` are updated according to the loop body, and `y` is unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the while loop in the program are:\n\n1. `x` and `z` are initialized to some values before the loop execution.\n2. `x` and `z` are updated according to the loop body in every iteration of the loop.\n3. `y` is unchanged after the loop termination.\n\nHere are the loop invariants in ACSL notation:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x = x0 && z = z0;\n    loop invariant x = x0 + (tmp ? 1 : -1) && z = z0 - (tmp ? 0 : 1);\n    loop invariant y = y0;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have assumed that `x0`, `z0`, and `y0` are the initial values of `x`, `z`, and `y`, respectively. These values are not explicitly initialized in the program, so we have to make an assumption about their values."
