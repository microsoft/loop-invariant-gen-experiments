If the assertion is false, label the program False.\n\nRules:\n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values.**\n- **Variables that are not explicitly initialized, could have garbage values. Do not make any assumptions about such values.**\n- **Check if the assertion is reachable, given the pre-conditions and the loop. If it is reachable, check if the assertion evaluates to true.

The program can take any combination of the branches during the loop execution. Let's analyze the branches:\n     - First branch: `(c > n)` then `(c = c + 1)`. This branch increments `c` if `c > n`.\n     - Second branch: `(c == n)` then `(c = 1)`. This branch sets `c` to 1 if `c == n`.\n\n4.
