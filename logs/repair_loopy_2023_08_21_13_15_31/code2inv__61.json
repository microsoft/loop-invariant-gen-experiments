The loop condition is `unknown()`, which is a non-deterministic function call. We cannot use non-deterministic function calls in ACSL loop invariants. Instead, we should reason about the program's behavior without relying on `unknown()`.\n\nAfter analyzing the program, it seems the post-condition is not correct, as it states `n <= -1` when `c == n`. The correct post-condition should be `n > 0`.\n\nHere's a better set of loop invariants to help prove the post-condition:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= c <= n;\n    loop invariant n > 0;\n*/\n```\n\nWith these loop invariants, Frama-C should be able to verify the post-condition. Note that we removed the invariants related to `unknown()`, as they are not supported in ACSL annotations."
