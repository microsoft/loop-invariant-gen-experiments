For example: \n```\n//@ assert x > 0;\n```\n\nInstructions:\n- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. \n- Check if the assertion expression is reachable and evaluates to true, for the given pre-conditions and the loop condition.\n- If the assertion is true, label the program True. If the assertion is false, label the program False.\n\nRules:\n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values.**\n- **Variables that are not explicitly initialized, could have garbage values. Do not make any assumptions about such values.**\n- **Check if the assertion is reachable, given the pre-conditions and the loop. If it is reachable, check if the assertion evaluates to true. If it evaluates to true, label the program True.

The assertion expression is: `sn==SIZE*a || sn == 0`\n\nWe know that `a` is defined as 1, so the assertion expression becomes: `sn==SIZE || sn == 0`\n\nInside the loop, the value of `sn` is updated as `sn = sn + a`. Since `a` is 1, `sn` will be incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. At the end of the loop, the value of `sn` will be equal to the number of iterations (which is `SIZE`).\n\nTherefore, the assertion `sn==SIZE || sn == 0` will evaluate to true in the following cases:\n\n- When `SIZE` is a positive integer, `sn` will be equal to `SIZE`.\n- When `SIZE` is 0 or a negative integer, the loop will not execute, and `sn` will remain 0.\n\nSince the function `unknown_int()` is not defined, we cannot make any assumptions about the value of `SIZE`.
