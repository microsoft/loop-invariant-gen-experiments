The loop may run zero or more times depending on the value of `__BLAST_NONDET`. Since it is an undefined variable, we have to consider both cases.\n2. If the loop doesn't run (`__BLAST_NONDET` evaluates to false), then `x` and `y` remain unchanged and the values of `x` and `y` will still be within the range `0 <= x <= 2` and `0 <= y <= 2`.\n3. If the loop runs, `x` and `y` will be incremented by 2 in each iteration. This means that the values of `x` and `y` will be even numbers, but we don't know how many times they will be incremented.\n4. After the loop, the first `if` statement checks if `y >= 0`. This is always true, given the pre-conditions and the loop body.\n5. The second `if` statement checks if `y <= 0`. This will be true only if `y` is 0, which is possible given the pre-conditions and the loop body.\n6. The third `if` statement checks if `4 <= x`. This is possible only if the loop has run at least once, since the initial value of `x` is within the range `0 <= x <= 2`.\n7. If all three `if` statements are true, the assertion `x < 4` will be evaluated.
