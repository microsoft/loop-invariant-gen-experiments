Since in starts at 0 and is always incremented, the first assertion is always true. The second assertion is true as long as in is less than inlen, which is guaranteed by the condition \"inlen > 0\" and the fact that the loop can break when buf reaches buflim.\n\n- The assertions after the loop are:\n```\n//@ assert(0<=buf);\n//@ assert(buf<bufferlen);\n```\nThese assertions are similar to the first two assertions inside the loop and hold true for the same reasons.\n\n- Finally, there are two more assertions after incrementing buf:\n```\n//@ assert(0<=buf);\n//@ assert(buf<bufferlen);\n```\nThe first assertion is true because buf is always non-negative. The second assertion is true because buf is incremented by 1, and it was already less than bufferlen, so it cannot exceed bufferlen in a single increment.\n\n4.
