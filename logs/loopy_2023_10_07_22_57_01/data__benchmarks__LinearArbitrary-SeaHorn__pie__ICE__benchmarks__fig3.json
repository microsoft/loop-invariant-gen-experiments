For example: \n```\n//@ assert x > 0;\n```\n\nInstructions:\n- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. \n- Check if the assertion expression is reachable and evaluates to true, for the given pre-conditions and the loop condition.\n- If the assertion is true, label the program True. If the assertion is false, label the program False.\n\nRules:\n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values.**\n- **Variables that are not explicitly initialized, could have garbage values. Do not make any assumptions about such values.**\n- **Check if the assertion is reachable, given the pre-conditions and the loop. If it is reachable, check if the assertion evaluates to true.

When x == y, the loop will exit. At this point, the value of lock depends on the value of 'input' in the last iteration of the loop. If 'input' was non-zero, lock would be set to 0, and y would be incremented. If 'input' was zero, lock would remain 1.\n\nSince 'input' is assigned with a call to unknown_int(), we cannot make any assumptions about its value.
