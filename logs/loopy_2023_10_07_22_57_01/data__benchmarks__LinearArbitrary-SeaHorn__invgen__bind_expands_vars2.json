Additionally, mc_i < n2 and n2 <= MAXDATA * 2 - n1, so mc_i < MAXDATA * 2 - n1.\n\nAdding these inequalities, we get:\n- cp1_off + mc_i < MAXDATA * 2 + (MAXDATA * 2 - n1)\n\nSince n1 <= MAXDATA * 2, we can say that MAXDATA * 2 >= n1. So, the sum of the two inequalities will be less than 2 * (MAXDATA * 2), which is equal to MAXDATA * 4.\n\nSo, the assertion cp1_off + mc_i < MAXDATA * 2 holds in every iteration of the loop, given the pre-conditions.\n\n4.
