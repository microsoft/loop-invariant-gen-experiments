This invariant is true before the loop starts, since j is initialized to 0. It is also preserved during the loop, as j is incremented in each iteration. Thus, this invariant is correct.\n\n2. `loop invariant j == 0 || j <= idBitLength / 8` is partially proven to be inductive. This invariant is true before the loop starts, since j is initialized to 0. It is also preserved during the loop, as the loop condition `(j < idBitLength / 8) && (j < material_length)` ensures that j is always less than `idBitLength / 8`. Thus, this invariant is correct.\n\n3. `loop invariant j == 0 || j <= material_length` is partially proven to be inductive. This invariant is true before the loop starts, since j is initialized to 0. It is also preserved during the loop, as the loop condition `(j < idBitLength / 8) && (j < material_length)` ensures that j is always less than `material_length`. Thus, this invariant is correct.\n\n4. `loop invariant 0 <= j / 4` is partially proven to be inductive. This invariant is true before the loop starts, since j is initialized to 0. It is also preserved during the loop, as j is incremented in each iteration and j is always non-negative. Thus, this invariant is correct.\n\n5. `loop invariant j == 0 || j * 8 <= idBitLength` is partially proven to be inductive. This invariant is true before the loop starts, since j is initialized to 0. It is also preserved during the loop, as the loop condition `(j < idBitLength / 8) && (j < material_length)` ensures that j is always less than `idBitLength / 8`. Multiplying both sides of the inequality by 8, we get `j * 8 < idBitLength`. Thus, this invariant is correct.\n\n6. `loop invariant nlen == idBitLength / 32` is partially proven to be inductive. This invariant is true before the loop starts, as it is given in the precondition. Since nlen and idBitLength are not modified during the loop, this invariant is preserved.
