It is established (i.e., holds before the loop) because x is initialized to 0. However, it is not preserved (i.e., doesn't hold after the loop). Since x is incremented by 4 in each iteration of the loop, the invariant should hold after the loop as well. We don't need to add or modify this invariant.\n\nThus, we can remove the second invariant, and the corrected loop invariants are:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x % 4 == 0;\n*/\n```"
