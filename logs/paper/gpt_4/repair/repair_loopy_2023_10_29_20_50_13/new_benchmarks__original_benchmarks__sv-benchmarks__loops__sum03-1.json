Thus, we need to find loop invariants that hold in each iteration of the loop.\n\nThe loop has three invariants:\n1. `i1: 0 <= sn <= x * a`\n2. `i2: x <= 10 ==> sn == x * a`\n3. `i3: x > 10 ==> sn == 10 * a`\n\nInvariant `i1` seems correct because it states that `sn` is always between `0` and `x * a` (inclusive), which can be seen from the loop body.\n\nInvariant `i2` states that if `x <= 10`, then `sn == x * a`. This is also correct, as when `x <= 10`, `sn` is updated by adding `a` in each iteration, so the relationship between `sn` and `x` is preserved.\n\nInvariant `i3` states that if `x > 10`, then `sn == 10 * a`. This is also correct because once `x` goes beyond 10, `sn` stops updating and remains at `10 * a`.\n\nHowever, since the loop does not terminate, the loop invariants do not help to prove the assertion inside the loop. Instead, we need an invariant that is always true for every iteration of the loop. We can rewrite the assertion as `sn == x * a || (sn == 0 && x == 1)` and use it as a loop invariant:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= sn <= x * a;\n    loop invariant x <= 10 ==> sn == x * a;\n    loop invariant x > 10 ==> sn == 10 * a;\n    loop invariant sn == x * a || (sn == 0 && x == 1);\n*/\n```\n\nWith these invariants, we can verify the assertion for every iteration of the loop."
