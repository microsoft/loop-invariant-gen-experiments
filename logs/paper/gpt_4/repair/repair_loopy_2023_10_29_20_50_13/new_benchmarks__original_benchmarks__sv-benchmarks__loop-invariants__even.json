To fix this, we can use the maximum value of an unsigned int, which is 2^32 - 1.\n\nNext, we analyze the loop condition, which is unknown_int(). Since the function unknown_int() is not defined, we cannot make any assumptions about its return value. Therefore, the loop can run any number of times, including zero.\n\nNow, let's check the loop invariants i1 and i2.\n\nInvariant i1: x <= 2^32 - 1\nThis invariant is true before the loop execution, as x is initialized to 0.

Finally, it holds after the loop termination.\n\nInvariant i2: x % 2 == 0\nThis invariant is true before the loop execution since x is initialized to 0. It is also preserved in every iteration of the loop, as x is incremented by 2 in each iteration, and therefore remains even.
