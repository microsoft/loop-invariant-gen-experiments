But some of the other invariants are not inductive.\nIf an invariant is established, it means that the verifier is able to prove that the invariant holds before the loop.\nIf an invariant is preserved, it means that the verifier is able to prove that the invariant holds after the loop, assuming that it holds before the loop.\n\nTo fix the non-inductive invariants, try the following:\nIf an invariant is partially proven to be inductive, make sure it is actually inductive. If it is not, remove it or replace it with a different inductive invariant. If it is, then fix the other non-inductive invariants.\nIf an invariant is preserved but not established, add a clause to the invariant to make it established (a clause that makes the invariant hold before the loop begins).\nIf an invariant is established but not preserved, add a clause to the invariant to make it preserved (a clause that makes the invariant hold after the loop ends, assuming that it holds before the loop begins).\nIf an invariant is neither established nor preserved, remove it or replace it with a different inductive invariant.\n\nIf none of the above is possible, add a new loop invariant to strengthen the existing invariants.\n\nPlease fix all the above-mentioned errors, and provide the corrected loop invariants for the program that are sufficient to verify the assertions in the program.\nUse the ACSL syntax to specify the invariants. Output only one code block in the end, with the fixed invariants. **Do not output any other code blocks**.\nLet's think step by step."
