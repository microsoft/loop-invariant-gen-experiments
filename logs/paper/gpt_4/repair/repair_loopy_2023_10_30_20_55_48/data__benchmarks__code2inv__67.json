The value of y is also unknown (it could contain a garbage value). \n\nIn the loop, the value of x is incremented by 1 in each iteration, and the value of y is set to n - x in each iteration. The loop continues as long as x is less than or equal to n.\n\nNow, let's analyze each invariant:\n\n- `i1: x >= 1;` This is true before the loop, and after each iteration of the loop, because x is initialized to 1 and is only incremented in the loop. So, this invariant is correct. \n\n- `i2: x <= n + 1;` This is not necessarily true before the loop, because n could contain a garbage value. However, if we add a precondition that n is non-negative, it will be true before the loop and preserved by the loop. \n\n- `i3: y == n - x + 1;` This is not necessarily true before the loop, because y could contain a garbage value. But it is established in the first iteration of the loop and preserved by the loop. \n\n- `i4: x <= n+1;` This is a repetition of i2, we do not need this invariant.\n\n- `i5: y == n - x + 1 ==> n > 0;` This is preserved by the loop, but not necessarily established before the loop, because y could contain a garbage value. We can remove this invariant because it is a weaker version of i3.\n\n- `i6: 1 <= x;` This is a repetition of i1, we do not need this invariant.\n\n- `i7: y >= 0 ==> n >= x-1;` This is not necessarily true before the loop, because y could contain a garbage value. But it is established in the first iteration of the loop and preserved by the loop.\n\n- `i8: n >= 0 ==> x <= n + 1;` This is a weaker version of i2, we do not need this invariant.\n\n- `i9: n < 0 ==> x == 1;` This is not necessarily true before the loop, because n could contain a garbage value. But, if we add a precondition that n is non-negative, it will be true before the loop and preserved by the loop.\n\n- `i10: y == n - (x - 1);` This is a stronger version of i3, we can replace i3 with this invariant.\n\n- `i11: y == n - x + 1 ==> x >= 1 && x <= n;` This is established by the loop, but not necessarily preserved by the loop.
