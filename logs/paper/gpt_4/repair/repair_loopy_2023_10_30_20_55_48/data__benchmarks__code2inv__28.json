This is also true since `x` is assigned the value of `n` at the beginning of the program, and the loop only decreases the value of `x`.\n3. `n - x >= 0`: This invariant states that the difference between `n` and `x` is always non-negative.

The loop is decrementing the value of 'x' until it reaches 0. The unproven assertion checks whether 'n' is less than 0 after the loop. The invariants i1, i2, i3, and i4 are all correct, but they do not help in proving the assertion. The invariant i5 is incorrect because it states that 'n' is equal to the value of 'x' at the beginning of the loop, which is not always the case after the first iteration.\n\nA new loop invariant can be added to connect 'x' and 'n'. At the beginning of the loop, 'x' is equal to 'n'. Every time the loop runs, 'x' is decremented by 1. Therefore, 'n' is always equal to the value of 'x' plus the number of times the loop has run, which is 'n - x'. Therefore, the correct loop invariant is 'n == x + \\at(n - x, LoopEntry)'.\n\nSo, the corrected loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1: x >= 0 ==> n >= 0;\n    loop invariant i2: x <= n;\n    loop invariant i3: n - x >= 0;\n    loop invariant i4: x > 0 ==> n > 0;\n    loop invariant i6: n == x + \\at(n - x, LoopEntry);\n*/\n```"
