However, Frama-C says it is partially proven to be inductive. This is likely because of the dependencies on the other invariants that are not correctly established.\n\n2. `i2: i <= size + 1;`: This invariant is preserved but not established. This means that it holds after the loop, but is not necessarily true before the loop. This is because `i` starts from 1, so the invariant should be `i <= size`. \n\n3. `i3: sn <= size;`: This invariant is partially proven to be inductive. Again, the issue seems to be the dependencies on the other invariants. As `sn` increments by 1 in each loop iteration and starts from 0, `sn` should always be less than or equal to `size` during the loop execution. \n\nThe assertion `sn == size` is partially proven. The reason for this is likely the issues with the loop invariants. \n\nBased on the above analysis, the second invariant `i2` should be corrected to `i <= size`. The other two invariants `i1` and `i3` should be correct, but they depend on the correct establishment of `i2`.\n\nSo, the corrected loop invariants are:\n\n```c\n/*@ \n  loop invariant i1: sn == i - 1;\n  loop invariant i2: i <= size;\n  loop invariant i3: sn <= size;\n*/\n```"
