                    "Firstly, notice that the variables `n` and `x` are not initialized and could contain any garbage values. The assignment `(x = n)` does not ensure that `x` is greater than or equal to 1, which is a precondition for our loop invariant `i1: x >= 1`. This is why Frama-C is saying this invariant is not established.\n\nSecondly, the invariant `i2: x <= n` is partially proven to be inductive, which means that it holds for some iterations of the loop but not for all. This is because the value of `x` is continuously decreasing in the loop, but there is no lower bound on `x`. Therefore, it is possible that `x` will eventually become less than 1 and hence less than `n`, violating the invariant.\n\nLastly, the invariant `i3: n == \\at(n, LoopEntry)` is partially proven to be inductive. This is because the value of `n` does not change during the loop, so this invariant should always hold. However, since `n` could be a garbage value, this invariant is only established if `n` is not a garbage value.\n\nTo fix these issues, we need to add appropriate preconditions and modify our loop invariants:\n\n- We can add a precondition to ensure that `n` and `x` are initialized to non-negative integers. This will ensure that `x` is always greater than or equal to 1 and `n` is not a garbage value.\n- We can modify `i1` to `x >= 1 && x <= n`, which will ensure that `x` is always in the range [1, `n`].\n- We can keep `i2` as it is, because it is correct and useful for proving the assertion after the loop.\n- We can keep `i3` as it is, because it is correct and helps to establish that the value of `n` does not change during the loop.\n\nHere are the corrected loop invariants:\n\n```c\n/*@ requires n >= 1;\n    requires x == n;\n\n    loop invariant x >= 1 && x <= n;\n    loop invariant n == \\at(n, LoopEntry);\n*/\nwhile ((x > 1)) {\n    (x  = (x - 1));\n}\n```\nThese invariants ensure that `x` decreases by 1 in each iteration of the loop and eventually reaches 1, which is exactly the condition for the assertion `x == 1`."

Therefore, the loop invariant `x >= 1 && x <= n && x == \\at(x, LoopEntry)` is not established as `x` can be less than 1 or greater than `n` before entering the loop.\n- The loop invariant `x >= 0 && x <= \\at(x, LoopEntry)` is partially proven to be inductive. It is established as `x` is always greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to its initial value before entering the loop. It is not preserved because `x` is decremented in the loop body, which means that `x` can become less than 0. However, this cannot happen because of the loop condition `x > 1`, so this invariant is actually preserved.\n- The assertion `x == 1` is partially proven. This is because if `n >= 0`, then `x` will be decremented until it becomes 1. However, since `n` can be less than 0, `x` can be less than 1 when the loop terminates.\n\nTo fix these issues, we need to add a precondition that `n >= 1`. This will ensure that `x`, which is equal to `n` before the loop, is always greater than or equal to 1.
