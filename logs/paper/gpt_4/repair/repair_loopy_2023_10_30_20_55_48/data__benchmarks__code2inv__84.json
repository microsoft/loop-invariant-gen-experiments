The integer `x` is initialized to `-50` and `y` is not initialized before the loop.\n\nSecondly, we analyze the loop body. In each iteration, `x` is incremented by `y` and `y` is incremented by `1`. The loop continues until `x` is less than `0`.\n\nThe loop invariant `i1: y == \\at(y, LoopEntry) + (x - \\at(x, LoopEntry) + 50)` is preserved but not established. It says that in each iteration of the loop, the value of `y` is equal to the value of `y` at the loop entry, plus the difference between the current value of `x` and the value of `x` at the loop entry, plus `50`. This invariant is not established because `y` is not initialized and could contain a garbage value before the loop.\n\nSince `y` is incremented by `1` in each iteration, a correct invariant would be `i1: y == \\at(y, LoopEntry) + (x - \\at(x, LoopEntry)) / -1`. However, since `y` is not initialized, we should initialize `y` to `0` before the loop.\n\nThe assertion `y > 0` is partially proven. It says that after the loop, `y` should be greater than `0`.
