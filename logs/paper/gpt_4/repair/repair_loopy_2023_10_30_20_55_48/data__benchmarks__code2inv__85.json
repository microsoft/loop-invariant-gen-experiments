                    "- The program declares five integer variables: x, y, z1, z2, z3. Only x is initialized, with the value -15000. The other variables are not initialized, and may contain garbage values. Let's ignore z1, z2, z3 as they are not used in the program.\n- The loop condition is `x < 0`.\n- The loop body increments y and adds the value of y to x.\n- The post-condition is `y > 0`.\n\nLet's analyze the loop invariants:\n- i1: `x <= 0` is partially inductive. The loop condition guarantees that x will be less than 0 during loop iterations, but it doesn't guarantee that x is less than or equal to 0 after the loop. To make this invariant hold after the loop, we should change it to `x >= 0`.\n- i2: `y >= 0` is established but not preserved. y is not initialized before the loop. We can't guarantee that y is nonnegative before the loop starts. Let's initialize y to 0 before the loop to establish this invariant.\n- i3, i4, i5: `x + y * (y + 1) / 2 == -15000`, `x + (y * (y - 1)) / 2 == -15000`, `x + (y * (y + 1)) / 2 == -15000` are neither established nor preserved. They are not inductive because they don't hold before the loop or after each iteration. These invariants are incorrect and should be removed.\n- i6, i7, i8: `x + y * (y + 1) / 2 >= -15000`, `x + y * (y - 1) / 2 >= -15000`, `x + y * y / 2 >= -15000` are partially inductive. They are not established because they don't hold before the loop starts. These invariants are incorrect and should be removed.\n\nLet's add an invariant `y == \\at(y, LoopEntry) + \\at(x, LoopEntry) + 15000` to ensure that the sum of y and x is always -15000. This is consistent with the loop body, where y is incremented and x is decreased by the same amount in each iteration. This invariant is established before the loop and preserved after each iteration.\n\nHere are the fixed invariants:\n```\nint main() {\n  \n  int x;\n  int y = 0;\n  \n  (x = -15000);\n  \n  /*@\n  loop invariant i1: x >= 0;\n  loop invariant i2: y >= 0;\n  loop invariant i3: y == \\at(y, LoopEntry) + \\at(x, LoopEntry) + 15000;\n  */\n  while ((x < 0)) {\n    {\n    (x  = (x + y));\n    (y  = (y + 1));\n    }\n\n  }\n  \n  {;\n  //@ assert( (y > 0) );\n  }\n}\n```"
