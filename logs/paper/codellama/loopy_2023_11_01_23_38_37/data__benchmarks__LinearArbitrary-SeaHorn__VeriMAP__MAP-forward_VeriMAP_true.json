The pre-conditions are:\n\n* `n >= 0` (from the `assume` statement)\n* `i = 0` (from the initialization of `i`)\n* `a = 0` (from the initialization of `a`)\n* `b = 0` (from the initialization of `b`)\n\nNext, we need to analyze the loop body.

Otherwise, `a = a+2` and `b = b+1`.\n\nWe can see that in both branches, `a` and `b` are updated based on their previous values. Therefore, we can infer that the following loop invariants hold:\n\n* `a >= 0` (since `a` is initialized to 0 and only increased by 1 or 2 in each iteration)\n* `b >= 0` (since `b` is initialized to 0 and only increased by 1 or 2 in each iteration)\n\nNow, we need to check the loop condition. The loop condition is `i < n`. Since `n` is a constant, we can infer that the following loop invariant holds:\n\n* `i <= n` (since `i` is initialized to 0 and only increased by 1 in each iteration)\n\nFinally, we need to check the post-condition. The post-condition is `a+b == 3*n`. We can infer that the following loop invariant holds:\n\n* `a+b <= 3*n` (since `a` and `b` are non-negative integers and `n` is a constant)\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the while loop in the given program are:\n\n* `a >= 0`\n* `b >= 0`\n* `i <= n`\n* `a+b <= 3*n`\n\nNote that we have not used any variables or functions that are not declared in the program, and we have not made any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.
