The loop condition is `1`, which means the loop will run indefinitely until a `break` statement is encountered.\n\nNext, let's identify the loop invariants. A loop invariant is a condition that remains true before, during, and after the loop execution. In this case, we need to find the loop invariants that imply the post-condition `result >= exp`.\n\nFrom the loop body, we can identify the following loop invariants:\n\n1. `term` is a floating-point number that is initially set to `1.0` and is multiplied by `x/count` in each iteration.\n2. `exp` is a floating-point number that is initially set to `1.0` and is increased by `term` in each iteration.\n3. `count` is an unsigned integer that is initially set to `1` and is increased by `1` in each iteration.\n4. `result` is a floating-point number that is initially set to `2*(1/(1-x))` and is increased by `term` in each iteration.\n\nWe can now use these loop invariants to prove the post-condition `result >= exp`.\n\nFirst, we can prove that `result >= exp` before the loop execution. This is because `result` is initially set to `2*(1/(1-x))`, which is greater than or equal to `exp` (which is initially set to `1.0`).\n\nNext, we can prove that `result >= exp` in every iteration of the loop. This is because in each iteration, `term` is multiplied by `x/count`, which means that `term` is always positive. Therefore, `exp` is always increased by a positive value, which means that `exp` is always greater than or equal to `result`.\n\nFinally, we can prove that `result >= exp` after the loop termination. This is because the loop will terminate when `temp` is equal to `0`, which means that `exp` will be increased by `term` one last time before the loop terminates. Since `term` is always positive, `exp` will be greater than or equal to `result` after the loop terminates.\n\nTherefore, we have proven that the loop invariants `term`, `exp`, `count`, and `result` imply the post-condition `result >= exp`.
