After the loop termination, `x` is equal to 100000000.\n\nNote that the loop invariants are based on the loop body and the loop condition, and they are used to verify the post-condition of the program. The loop invariants are necessary but not sufficient conditions for the post-condition to hold.\n\nIn ACSL annotations, we can specify the loop invariants as follows:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant x == 0;\n    loop invariant x < 100000000;\n    loop invariant x == 100000000;\n@*/\n```\nThe first loop invariant `x == 0` is true before the loop execution, and it remains true in every iteration of the loop. The second loop invariant `x < 100000000` is true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop, and it is used to ensure that the loop terminates. The third loop invariant `x == 100000000` is true after the loop termination, and it is used to verify the post-condition of the program.\n\nBy using these loop invariants, Frama-C can verify the post-condition of the program, which is `x == 100000000`."
