We can start by identifying the variables that are modified inside the loop body, which are `x`, `y`, `w`, and `z`.\n\n1. Before the loop execution, the variable `x` is initialized to 0, and the variable `y` is also initialized to 0. Therefore, we can say that the loop invariant is true before the loop execution.\n2.

Therefore, we can say that the loop invariant is true in every iteration of the loop.\n3. After the loop termination, the variable `x` is equal to the variable `y`, which is the post-condition of the loop.
