Before the loop execution, `i` is greater than or equal to 0. This is because the loop condition is `i > 0`, which means `i` must be positive or 0 before the loop starts.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, `i` is greater than or equal to 0. This is because the loop body decreases the value of `i` by 1 in each iteration, so `i` will always be positive or 0 within the loop.\n3. After the loop termination, `i` is equal to 0. This is because the loop condition is `i > 0`, which means the loop will continue executing as long as `i` is positive. When the loop terminates, `i` must be equal to 0, because the loop body decreases the value of `i` by 1 in each iteration, and the loop condition is no longer satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the while loop in the given C program are:\n\n* `i >= 0` before the loop execution\n* `i >= 0` in every iteration of the loop\n* `i == 0` after the loop termination\n\nNote that these loop invariants are necessary conditions for the post-condition `i >= 0` to be true.
