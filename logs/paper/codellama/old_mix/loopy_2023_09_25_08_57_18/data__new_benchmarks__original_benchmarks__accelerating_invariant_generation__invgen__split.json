This implies that the loop invariant should be true for all values of `n` between `0` and `2*k-1`.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body. The loop body consists of two statements: `i++` and `j++`.

The loop body swaps the values of i and j, and the loop condition is b, which is initially set to 0.\n\nTo find the loop invariants, we need to analyze the loop body and the loop condition.\n\n1. Before the loop execution, the loop condition is b, which is initially set to 0. So, the loop invariant before the loop execution is \"b == 0\".\n2. In every iteration of the loop, the loop condition is b, which alternates between 0 and 1. So, the loop invariant in every iteration is \"b == 0 || b == 1\".\n3. After the loop termination, the loop condition is b, which is equal to 0. So, the loop invariant after the loop termination is \"b == 0\".\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the loop in the program above are:\n\n* \"b == 0\" before the loop execution\n* \"b == 0 || b == 1\" in every iteration of the loop\n* \"b == 0\" after the loop termination\n\nNote that these loop invariants imply the post-condition \"i == j\", which is the desired property that we want to verify using Frama-C.",
