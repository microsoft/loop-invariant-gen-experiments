The variable assignments are `x = 0` and `x = x + 1` in the loop body.\n\nNext, let's analyze the loop condition. The loop condition is `x < n`. This means that the loop will terminate when `x` is equal to `n`.\n\nNow, let's identify the loop invariants. A loop invariant is a condition that remains true before, during, and after each iteration of the loop. To find the loop invariants, we need to analyze the loop body and the loop condition.\n\nThe loop invariant that is true before the loop execution is `x == 0`. This is because the variable `x` is initialized to `0` before the loop starts.\n\nThe loop invariant that is true in every iteration of the loop is `x < n`. This is because the loop condition is `x < n`, and the loop body increments `x` by `1` in each iteration.\n\nThe loop invariant that is true after the loop termination is `x == n`. This is because the loop terminates when `x` is equal to `n`.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the while loop in the program are:\n\n* `x == 0` (before the loop execution)\n* `x < n` (in every iteration of the loop)\n* `x == n` (after the loop termination)\n\nNote that these loop invariants are necessary and sufficient to verify the post-condition `x == n` of the program.",

            "ERROR: Output does not contain at least 1 code block\nOutput:\n To find the loop invariants for the while loop in the given program, we need to analyze the loop body and the loop condition.\n\nFirst, we note that the loop condition is `x < n`. This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as `x` is less than `n`.\n\nNext, we analyze the loop body. The loop body consists of a single statement: `x = x + 1;`. This statement increments the value of `x` by 1 in each iteration of the loop.\n\nNow, we can identify three loop invariants for the while loop:\n\n1. Before the loop execution, `x` is equal to 0. This is because the variable `x` is initialized to 0 just before the loop.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, `x` is less than `n`. This is because the loop condition is `x < n`, and the loop body increments `x` by 1 in each iteration.\n3. After the loop termination, `x` is equal to `n`. This is because the loop terminates when `x` is equal to `n`, and the loop body increments `x` by 1 in each iteration.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the while loop are:\n\n* `x == 0` before the loop execution\n* `x < n` in every iteration of the loop\n* `x == n` after the loop termination\n\nNote that we have not used any variables or functions that are not declared in the program, and we have not made any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.
