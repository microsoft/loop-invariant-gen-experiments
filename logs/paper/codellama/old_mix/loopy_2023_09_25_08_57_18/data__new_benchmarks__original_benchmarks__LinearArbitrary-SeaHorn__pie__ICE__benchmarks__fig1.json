The second statement increments the value of `y` by 1.\n\nLoop Condition:\nThe loop condition is `x < 0`. This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as `x` is less than 0.\n\nLoop Invariants:\nTo ensure that the loop terminates, we need to find loop invariants that are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nBefore the loop execution:\nThere are no loop invariants that are true before the loop execution.\n\nIn every iteration of the loop:\nWe can infer that `x` is always less than 0, since the loop condition is `x < 0`.\n\nAfter the loop termination:\nWe can infer that `y` is greater than 0, since the loop will terminate when `x` becomes greater than or equal to 0.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the while loop are:\n```scss\n/*@\n    loop invariant x < 0;\n    loop invariant y > 0;\n*/\n```\nThese loop invariants are sufficient to ensure that the loop terminates, and that `y` is greater than 0 after the loop termination."
