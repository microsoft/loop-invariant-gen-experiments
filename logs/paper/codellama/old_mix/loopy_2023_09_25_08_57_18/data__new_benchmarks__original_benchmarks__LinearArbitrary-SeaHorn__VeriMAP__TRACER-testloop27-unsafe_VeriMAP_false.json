So, the loop invariant in every iteration is `i == 0 && x == 0`.\n\n(iii) After the loop termination:\nThe loop invariant should be true after the loop terminates. In this case, we can say that the loop terminates when `i` becomes greater than 1. So, the loop invariant after the loop termination is `i > 1`.\n\nHere are the loop invariants in one code block:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant i == 0 && x == 0;\n    loop invariant i > 1;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have not used any variables or functions that are not declared in the program, and we have not made any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.
