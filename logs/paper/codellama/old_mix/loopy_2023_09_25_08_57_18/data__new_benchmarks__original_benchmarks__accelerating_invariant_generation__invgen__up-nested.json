Pre-condition:\nThe pre-condition for the loop is `j <= n`.\n2. Loop condition:\nThe loop condition is `j <= n`.\n3. Loop body:\nThe loop body consists of two statements:\n* `i++`\n* `j++`\n4. Post-condition:\nThe post-condition for the loop is `i >= 0`.\n\nNow, let's find the loop invariants:\n\n1. Loop invariant before the loop execution:\nBefore the loop execution, the variable `i` is initialized to 0, so the loop invariant before the loop execution is `i == 0`.\n2. Loop invariant in every iteration of the loop:\nDuring each iteration of the loop, the variable `i` is incremented by 1, so the loop invariant in every iteration of the loop is `i == j - n`.\n3. Loop invariant after the loop termination:\nAfter the loop termination, the variable `i` is still equal to `j - n`, so the loop invariant after the loop termination is `i == j - n`.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the while loop in the program are:\n\n* `i == 0` before the loop execution\n* `i == j - n` in every iteration of the loop\n* `i == j - n` after the loop termination\n\nNote that these loop invariants imply the post-condition `i >= 0`.",
