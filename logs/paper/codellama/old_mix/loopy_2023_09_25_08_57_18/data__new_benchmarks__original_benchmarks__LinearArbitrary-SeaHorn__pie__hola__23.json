            "ERROR: Output does not contain at least 1 code block\nOutput:\n The given program has a loop that iterates from 0 to n-1, and the loop body consists of a single statement that updates the value of the variable \"sum\" by adding the value of \"i\" to it.\n\nTo find the loop invariants of the loop, we need to analyze the loop body and the loop condition.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the loop body. The loop body updates the value of \"sum\" by adding \"i\" to it. Therefore, we can say that the loop body preserves the value of \"sum\" in the sense that the value of \"sum\" before the loop body execution is equal to the value of \"sum\" after the loop body execution.\n\nNext, let's analyze the loop condition. The loop condition is \"i < n\". Therefore, we can say that the loop invariant \"i <= n\" is true before the loop execution, and it is true in every iteration of the loop.\n\nNow, let's combine these two loop invariants to get the overall loop invariant. We can say that the loop invariant \"i <= n\" and \"sum >= 0\" is true before the loop execution, and it is true in every iteration of the loop.\n\nFinally, we can say that the loop invariant \"sum >= 0\" is true after the loop termination, since the loop body preserves the value of \"sum\" and the loop condition ensures that the loop terminates when \"i\" reaches \"n\".\n\nTherefore, the necessary loop invariants of the while loop to help Frama-C verify the post-condition are:\n\n* \"i <= n\"\n* \"sum >= 0\"\n\nNote that we have not used any variables or functions that are not declared in the program, and we have not made any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given. We have also followed the rules specified in the instructions, such as not using variables that have garbage values, not using non-deterministic function calls, and not using the \\at(x, Pre) notation.",
