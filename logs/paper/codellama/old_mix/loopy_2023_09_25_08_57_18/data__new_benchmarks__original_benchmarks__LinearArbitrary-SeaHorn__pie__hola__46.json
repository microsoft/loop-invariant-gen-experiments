The first if statement checks if `w` is odd, and if so, it increments `x` and `w`. The second if statement checks if `z` is even, and if so, it increments `y` and `z`.\n* The loop condition is `unknown2()`, which is a function that returns a boolean value.\n\nNow, let's find the loop invariants:\n\n* Before the loop starts, the variable `w` is assigned the value `1`, and the variable `z` is assigned the value `0`. These values are not modified inside the loop, so they are loop invariants.\n* In every iteration of the loop, the variables `x` and `y` are incremented by `1` if certain conditions are met. These increments are not dependent on the previous value of `x` or `y`, so they are loop invariants.\n* After the loop terminates, the variables `x` and `y` have values that are at most `1` greater than their initial values. This is because the loop may terminate early if `unknown2()` returns `false`.\n\nHere are the loop invariants that can be used to verify the post-condition:\n\n* Before the loop starts, `w = 1` and `z = 0`.\n* In every iteration of the loop, `x <= 1` and `y <= 1`.\n* After the loop terminates, `x <= 1` and `y <= 1`.\n\nHere is the code block with the loop invariants:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant w == 1;\n    loop invariant z == 0;\n    loop invariant x <= 1;\n    loop invariant y <= 1;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have not used any variables or functions that are not declared in the program, and we have not made any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.
