Specifically, `w` and `x` are incremented, while `y` and `z` are decremented.\n\nTo find the loop invariants, we need to identify the conditions that are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nLet's consider the loop invariant `I1`:\n```\nI1: w >= x\n```\nThis invariant is true before the loop execution because `w` and `x` are initialized to the same value `unknown_uint()`.\n\nIn every iteration of the loop, `w` and `x` are incremented or decremented by the same amount, so the invariant is preserved.\n\nAfter the loop termination, `w` and `x` are equal because the loop terminates when `unknown_uint()` is false. Therefore, `w` and `x` are equal, and `I1` is true.\n\nNow, let's consider the loop invariant `I2`:\n```\nI2: y >= z\n```\nThis invariant is true before the loop execution because `y` and `z` are initialized to the same value `unknown_uint()`.\n\nIn every iteration of the loop, `y` and `z` are incremented or decremented by the same amount, so the invariant is preserved.\n\nAfter the loop termination, `y` and `z` are equal because the loop terminates when `unknown_uint()` is false. Therefore, `y` and `z` are equal, and `I2` is true.\n\nFinally, let's consider the loop invariant `I3`:\n```\nI3: w == x && y == z\n```\nThis invariant is true before the loop execution because `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` are all initialized to the same value `unknown_uint()`.\n\nIn every iteration of the loop, `w` and `x` are incremented or decremented by the same amount, and `y` and `z` are incremented or decremented by the same amount. Therefore, `I3` is preserved.\n\nAfter the loop termination, `w` and `x` are equal because the loop terminates when `unknown_uint()` is false. Similarly, `y` and `z` are equal. Therefore, `I3` is true.\n\nBased on the analysis above, the loop invariants for the loop in the given program are `I1`, `I2`, and `I3`. These loop invariants can be used to verify the post-condition `w == x && y == z` of the loop."
