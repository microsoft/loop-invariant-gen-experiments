We have:\n\n* `n = unknown_uint()`: `n` is a random unsigned integer.\n* `sn = 0`: `sn` is initialized to 0.\n* `i = 1`: `i` is initialized to 1.\n\nNext, let's analyze the loop body. The loop body consists of two statements:\n\n* `sn = sn + a`: This statement adds `a` to `sn`.\n* `if (i == 4) sn = -10`: This statement checks if `i` is equal to 4, and if so, sets `sn` to -10.\n\nNow, let's make a note of the loop condition. The loop condition is `i <= n`. This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.\n\nTo find the loop invariants, we need to identify the conditions that are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nHere are the loop invariants for the loop in the program:\n\n* Before the loop execution: `sn == 0`\n* In every iteration of the loop: `sn + a >= 0`\n* After the loop termination: `sn == n * a || sn == 0`\n\nThe first loop invariant, `sn == 0`, is true before the loop execution because `sn` is initialized to 0.\n\nThe second loop invariant, `sn + a >= 0`, is true in every iteration of the loop because `sn` is always greater than or equal to 0, and `a` is a positive integer.\n\nThe third loop invariant, `sn == n * a || sn == 0`, is true after the loop termination because `sn` is either equal to `n * a` or 0. If `i` is equal to 4, then `sn` is set to -10, which means that `sn` is not equal to `n * a`. However, if `i` is not equal to 4, then `sn` is set to `sn + a`, which means that `sn` is equal to `n * a`. Therefore, the third loop invariant is true after the loop termination.\n\nIn summary, the loop invariants for the loop in the program are:\n\n* `sn == 0` (before the loop execution)\n* `sn + a >= 0` (in every iteration of the loop)\n* `sn == n * a || sn == 0` (after the loop termination)\n\nThese loop invariants can be used to verify the post-condition of the program, which is `sn == n * a || sn == 0`.",
