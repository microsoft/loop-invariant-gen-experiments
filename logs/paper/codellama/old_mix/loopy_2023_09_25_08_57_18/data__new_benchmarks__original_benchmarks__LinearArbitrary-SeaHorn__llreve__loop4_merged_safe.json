The loop invariant is a condition that is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. The loop invariant is used to verify the post-condition of the loop.\n\nTo find the loop invariant, we need to analyze the loop body and the loop condition. The loop body consists of two if statements. The first if statement checks if i1 is less than n + n, and if it is, it increments j1 and i1. The second if statement checks if i2 is less than n, and if it is, it increments j2 and i2.\n\nThe loop condition is 1. The loop continues to execute as long as the condition is true.\n\nBased on the analysis of the loop body and the loop condition, we can identify the following loop invariants:\n\n1. j1 == i1 - n\n2. j2 == i2 - n\n3. i1 <= n + n\n4. i2 <= n\n5. j1 <= j2\n\nThe first invariant states that the difference between j1 and i1 is equal to n. This invariant is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nThe second invariant states that the difference between j2 and i2 is equal to n. This invariant is also true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nThe third invariant states that i1 is less than or equal to n + n. This invariant is true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop.\n\nThe fourth invariant states that i2 is less than or equal to n. This invariant is true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop.\n\nThe fifth invariant states that j1 is less than or equal to j2. This invariant is true after the loop termination.\n\nBased on the loop invariants, we can verify the post-condition of the loop. The post-condition is that j1 is equal to j2. This can be proven by using the loop invariants.\n\nThe loop invariants imply that j1 is equal to i1 - n, and j2 is equal to i2 - n. Therefore, j1 - j2 is equal to i1 - i2. Since i1 - i2 is less than or equal to n, we can conclude that j1 - j2 is less than or equal to n.\n\nTherefore, the post-condition of the loop is true. The loop invariants imply that the post-condition is true, and the loop terminates when the post-condition is true.\n\nIn summary, the loop invariants for the loop in the program above are:\n\n1. j1 == i1 - n\n2. j2 == i2 - n\n3. i1 <= n + n\n4. i2 <= n\n5. j1 <= j2",
