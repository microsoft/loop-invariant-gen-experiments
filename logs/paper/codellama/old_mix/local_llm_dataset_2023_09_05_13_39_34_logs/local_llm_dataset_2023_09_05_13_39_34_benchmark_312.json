If it is not, then the variables `y` and `x` are incremented or decremented depending on the value of `j`.\n2. Loop Condition:\nThe loop condition is `unknown_bool()`, which is a function that returns a boolean value. The loop continues to execute as long as this function returns true.\n\nNow, let's find the loop invariants:\n\n1. Before the loop execution:\nThe loop invariant before the loop execution is `x + y == k`, which is the condition for the loop to terminate.\n2. In every iteration of the loop:\nThe loop invariant in every iteration of the loop is `x + y == k`, which is the condition for the loop to terminate.\n3. After the loop termination:\nThe loop invariant after the loop termination is `x + y == k`, which is the condition for the loop to terminate.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the while loop in the given program are:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant x + y == k;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have only one loop invariant, which is `x + y == k`, and it is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination."
