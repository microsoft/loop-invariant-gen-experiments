The variable `i` is incremented by `1` in each iteration of the loop.\n\nTo find the loop invariants, we need to identify the properties that are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nBefore the loop execution, the variable `i` is equal to `0`, and the variable `j` is equal to `0`.\n\nIn every iteration of the loop, the variable `k` is assigned the value `1` if `i` is less than `1`, and the value `0` otherwise. The variable `j` is incremented by `1` in each iteration of the loop. The variable `i` is incremented by `1` in each iteration of the loop.\n\nAfter the loop termination, the variable `i` is equal to `N`, and the variable `j` is equal to `N-1`.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclude that the loop invariants for the loop in the program are:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant i >= 0;\n    loop invariant j >= 0;\n    loop invariant k == 1 if i < 1 else k == 0;\n*/\n```\nNote that the loop invariant `k == 1 if i < 1 else k == 0` is a conditional expression that is true if `i` is less than `1`, and false otherwise."
