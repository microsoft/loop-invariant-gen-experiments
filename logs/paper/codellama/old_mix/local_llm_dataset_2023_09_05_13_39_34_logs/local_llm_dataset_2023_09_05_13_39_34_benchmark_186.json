The second statement checks if the value of `input` is non-zero, and if so, assigns the value of `x` to `m`. The third statement increments the value of `x` by 1.\n\nLoop Condition:\nThe loop condition is `x < N`, where `N` is a random integer value assigned to the variable `N` at the beginning of the program.\n\nLoop Invariants:\n\n1. `x` is a non-negative integer.\n2. `m` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to `N`.\n3. `input` is a non-negative integer.\n4. `x` is less than or equal to `N`.\n\nThe first loop invariant is trivially true before the loop execution, and is maintained in every iteration of the loop. The second loop invariant is true before the loop execution, and is maintained in every iteration of the loop, since `m` is assigned the value of `x` if `input` is non-zero, and `x` is incremented by 1 in every iteration. The third loop invariant is true before the loop execution, and is maintained in every iteration of the loop, since `input` is assigned a random integer value at the beginning of the program, and the loop condition checks if `input` is non-zero. The fourth loop invariant is true before the loop execution, and is maintained in every iteration of the loop, since `x` is incremented by 1 in every iteration, and the loop condition checks if `x` is less than or equal to `N`.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the while loop in the given program are:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant m <= N;\n    loop invariant input >= 0;\n    loop invariant x <= N;\n*/\n```"
