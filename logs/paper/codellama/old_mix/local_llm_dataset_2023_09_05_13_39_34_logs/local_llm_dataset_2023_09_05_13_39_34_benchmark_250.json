This function is not defined in the program, so we cannot use it in the loop invariants. Instead, we have used the `unknown()` function, which returns a garbage value. We have also used the `==` operator to compare the values of `x` and `y`, which is not allowed in ACSL. However, we can use the `==` operator to compare the values of `x` and 99, which is allowed in ACSL."
