This is because the loop body only decrements `y` by 1 in each iteration, and `y` is initialized to a value greater than or equal to 0.\n\nHere are the loop invariants in a code block format:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n    loop invariant x == 0;\n    loop invariant y == 0;\n*/\n```\nNote that these loop invariants are necessary but not sufficient conditions for the post-condition `y >= 0`. The post-condition is a stronger condition that requires `y` to be greater than or equal to 0, not just equal to 0. To prove the post-condition, we would need to show that the loop invariants imply the post-condition, which is not the case in this example."
