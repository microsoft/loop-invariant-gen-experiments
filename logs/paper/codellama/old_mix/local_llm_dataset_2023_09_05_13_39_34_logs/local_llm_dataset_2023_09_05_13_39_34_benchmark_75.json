In every iteration of the loop, the statement `sn = sn + a;` increments the value of `sn` by `a`. Therefore, the loop invariant `sn == sn + a` is true in every iteration of the loop.\n3. After the loop termination, the variable `sn` is equal to the sum of `a` and the number of times the loop body is executed. Therefore, the loop invariant `sn == n*a || sn == 0` is true after the loop termination.\n\nHere are the loop invariants for the given program:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant sn == 0;\n    loop invariant sn == sn + a;\n    loop invariant sn == n*a || sn == 0;\n*/\n```\nNote that the loop invariant `sn == n*a || sn == 0` is a conjunction of two conditions: `sn == n*a` and `sn == 0`. We have split the conjunction into its parts to make it easier to understand."
