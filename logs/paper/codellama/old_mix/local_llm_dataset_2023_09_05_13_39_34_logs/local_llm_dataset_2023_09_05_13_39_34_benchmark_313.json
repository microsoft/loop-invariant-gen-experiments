The second statement increments the value of `k` by either 4000 or 2000, depending on the value of `flag`.\n\nLoop Condition:\nThe loop condition is `i<n`. This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.\n\nNow, let's find the loop invariants.\n\nLoop Invariants:\n\n1. Before the loop execution, the value of `i` is 0.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, the value of `i` is less than `n`.\n3. After the loop termination, the value of `k` is greater than `n`.\n\nHere are the loop invariants in code block format:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n    loop invariant i3;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have split the loop invariant into three parts, as requested in the instructions. Also, we have used the `@` symbol to indicate that these are ACSL annotations."
