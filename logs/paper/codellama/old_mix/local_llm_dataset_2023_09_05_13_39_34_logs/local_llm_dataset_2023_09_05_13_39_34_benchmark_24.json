The loop body consists of two if-else statements. The first if-statement checks if `x` is less than `0xfff1`, and if so, it increments `x` by 1. The else-statement checks if `x` is greater than or equal to `0xfff1`, and if so, it increments `x` by 2.\n\nNow, let's identify the loop invariant. The loop invariant is a condition that must be true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. In this case, the loop invariant is:\n\n* `x` is an unsigned integer\n* `x` is less than `0x0fffffff`\n\nThis loop invariant is true before the loop execution because `x` is initialized to 0, which is less than `0x0fffffff`. It is also true in every iteration of the loop because the loop body only increments `x` by 1 or 2, which keeps `x` less than `0x0fffffff`. Finally, it is true after the loop termination because the loop terminates when `x` reaches `0x0fffffff`, which means that `x` is less than `0x0fffffff`.\n\nTo output the loop invariants, we can use the following code block:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant x < 0x0fffffff;\n*/\n```\nThis code block specifies the loop invariant using the ACSL annotation syntax. The `loop invariant` keyword indicates that the following expression is a loop invariant, and the expression `x < 0x0fffffff` specifies the invariant condition."
