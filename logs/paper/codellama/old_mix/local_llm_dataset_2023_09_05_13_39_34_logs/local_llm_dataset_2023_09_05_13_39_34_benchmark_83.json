The loop body contains a single if-else statement that modifies the values of `x` and `z`. If the condition `tmp` is true, then `x` is incremented by 1. If the condition `tmp` is false, then `x` is decremented by 1 and `z` is decremented by 1.\n\nNow, let's identify the loop invariants. A loop invariant is a condition that is true before the loop starts, remains true throughout the loop execution, and is true after the loop terminates. To find the loop invariants, we need to analyze the loop condition and the loop body.\n\nThe first loop invariant is \\begin{code}\nx<100\n\\end{code}, which is true before the loop starts and remains true throughout the loop execution.

This is because the loop body ensures that `x` is never decremented below 0.\n\nThe fourth loop invariant is `z>=0`, which is true before the loop starts and remains true throughout the loop execution. This is because the loop body ensures that `z` is never decremented below 0.\n\nFinally, the fifth loop invariant is `x>=100 || z<=100`, which is true after the loop terminates. This is because the loop condition \\begin{code}\nx<100 && 100<z\n\\end{code} ensures that the loop terminates when either `x` is greater than or equal to 100 or `z` is less than or equal to 100.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the loop in the given program are:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant x<100;\n    loop invariant z>100;\n    loop invariant x>=0;\n    loop invariant z>=0;\n    loop invariant x>=100 || z<=100;\n*/\n```\nNote that these loop invariants can be used to verify the post-condition of the loop, which is `x>=100 || z<=100`."

The loop body updates `x` and `z` based on the value of `tmp`, which is a boolean value returned by `unknown_bool()`.\n\nTo find the loop invariants, we need to analyze the loop body and the loop condition. We can start by identifying the variables that are modified within the loop body: `x` and `z`.\n\nNext, we need to identify the loop invariants that are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nHere are the loop invariants for the given program:\n\n1. Before the loop execution: `x < 100 && z < 100`\n2. In every iteration of the loop: `x < 100 && z < 100`\n3. After the loop termination: `x >= 100 || z <= 100`\n\nThese loop invariants are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination, respectively. They imply the post-condition `x >= 100 || z <= 100`, which is the desired property that we want to verify.\n\nNote that we have used the `assume` statement to ensure that the pre-conditions are satisfied before the loop execution. We have also used the `assert` statement to check the post-condition after the loop termination."
