The loop invariants are the conditions that are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can identify the following loop invariants:\n\n1. Before the loop execution, `sn` is initialized to `0`.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, `sn` is equal to `x * a` or `0`.\n3. After the loop termination, `sn` is equal to `x * a` or `0`.\n\nHere are the loop invariants in ACSL notation:\n```\n/*@\n  loop invariant sn == 0 || sn == x * a;\n  loop invariant x >= 0;\n  loop invariant x <= n1;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used the `x` variable to represent the number of iterations of the loop, and `n1` to represent the number of iterations of the loop. These variables are not explicitly declared in the program, but we can assume that they are defined and initialized to appropriate values.\n\nAlso, we have used the `assume` keyword to specify the loop invariants. The `assume` keyword is used to specify a condition that is assumed to be true in a particular context. In this case, we are assuming that the loop invariants are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination."
