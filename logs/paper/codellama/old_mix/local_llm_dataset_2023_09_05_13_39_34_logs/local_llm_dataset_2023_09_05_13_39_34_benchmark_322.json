These assignments update the values of `i` and `k` in each iteration of the loop.\n\nNext, let's analyze the loop condition:\n```\nwhile (unknown_bool()) {\n  ...\n}\n```\nThe loop condition is a call to the `unknown_bool()` function, which returns a boolean value. The loop continues to execute as long as the function returns `true`.\n\nNow, let's find the loop invariants:\n\n(i) Before the loop execution:\n\n* `i` is not equal to `k`\n* `i` is not equal to `1`\n\nThese invariants are true before the loop execution because `i` and `k` are initialized to different values, and `i` is not equal to `1`.\n\n(ii) In every iteration of the loop:\n\n* `i` is not equal to `k`\n* `i` is not equal to `1`\n* `k` is not equal to `0`\n\nThese invariants are true in every iteration of the loop because `i` and `k` are updated in each iteration, and `k` is not equal to `0`.\n\n(iii) After the loop termination:\n\n* `i` is not equal to `k`\n* `i` is not equal to `1`\n* `k` is equal to `0`\n\nThese invariants are true after the loop termination because `i` and `k` are updated in each iteration, and `k` is equal to `0` after the loop terminates.\n\nFinally, we can output the loop invariants in one code block:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant i != k;\n    loop invariant i != 1;\n    loop invariant k != 0;\n*/\n```\nNote that we do not use any variables or functions that are not declared in the program, and we do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given. We also do not use keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops."

A loop invariant is a condition that remains true before the loop, during each iteration of the loop, and after the loop.\n\nFrom the loop body, we can see that the value of `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, and the value of `k` is decremented by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, we can say that the loop invariant is:\n```\ni = i + 1;\nk = k - 1;\n```\nThis loop invariant is true before the loop, during each iteration of the loop, and after the loop.\n\nHowever, we also need to consider the loop condition. In this case, the loop condition is `unknown_bool()`, which is a function that returns a boolean value. We don't know the definition of this function, so we can't make any assumptions about its behavior.\n\nTherefore, the final loop invariants for the loop in the given C program are:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant i = i + 1;\n    loop invariant k = k - 1;\n@*/\n```\nNote that these loop invariants are true before the loop, during each iteration of the loop, and after the loop, but they don't imply the post-condition `1 <= i + k && i + k <= 2 && i >= 1`. To prove the post-condition, we need to use other techniques, such as mathematical induction or bounded model checking."
