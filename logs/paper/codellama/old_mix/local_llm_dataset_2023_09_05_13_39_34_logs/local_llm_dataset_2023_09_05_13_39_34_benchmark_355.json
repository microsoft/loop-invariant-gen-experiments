This means that the loop will iterate as long as `i` is greater than 0.\n\nNext, let's analyze the loop body:\n```\ni = i - 1;\nj = j + 1;\n```\nThis loop body decrements `i` by 1 and increments `j` by 1.\n\nNow, let's think about the loop invariants that we need to establish to verify the post-condition `r > i + j`. We need to ensure that the following conditions are true:\n\n1. Before the loop execution, `i` is greater than 0.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, `i` is greater than 0.\n3. After the loop termination, `r` is greater than `i + j`.\n\nBased on the loop body and the loop condition, we can establish the following loop invariants:\n\n1. Before the loop execution, `i` is greater than 0.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, `i` is greater than 0.\n3. After the loop termination, `r` is greater than `i + j`.\n\nHere are the loop invariants in ACSL format:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i > 0;\n    loop invariant i > 0;\n    loop invariant r > i + j;\n*/\n```\nNote that we are not using any variables or functions that are not declared in the program. We are also not making any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given. All undefined variables contain garbage values, so we are not using variables that have garbage values. Finally, we are not using keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops."

Loop Body:\nThe loop body consists of two statements:\n```scss\ni = i - 1;\nj = j + 1;\n```\nThese statements can be simplified to:\n```scss\ni = i - 1;\nj = j + 1;\n```\n2. Loop Condition:\nThe loop condition is given by the expression `i > 0`.\n\n3. Loop Invariants:\nA loop invariant is a condition that is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nTo find the loop invariants, we can use the following steps:\n\n* Identify the variables that are modified in the loop body. In this case, the variables `i` and `j` are modified.\n* For each modified variable, we need to find a loop invariant that ensures the variable is always greater than or equal to 0.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the loop invariants for the loop in the program are:\n```scss\n/*@\n    loop invariant i >= 0;\n    loop invariant j >= 0;\n*/\n```\nThese loop invariants ensure that the variables `i` and `j` are always greater than or equal to 0, which is necessary to satisfy the post-condition `r > i + j`."
