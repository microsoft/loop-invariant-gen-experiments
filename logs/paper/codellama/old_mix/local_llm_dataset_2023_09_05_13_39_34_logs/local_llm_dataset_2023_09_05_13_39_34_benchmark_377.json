The second if-else statement checks if `c2` is true, and if so, it subtracts `d2` from `x2`. The third if-else statement subtracts `d3` from `x3` regardless of the value of `c1` or `c2`.\n2. Loop Condition:\nThe loop condition is `x1>0 && x2>0 && x3>0`. This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` are all greater than 0.\n\nNow, let's find the loop invariants:\n\n1. Before the loop execution:\nThere are no loop invariants that are true before the loop execution.\n2. In every iteration of the loop:\nWe can say that the following loop invariants are true in every iteration of the loop:\n* `x1 >= 0`\n* `x2 >= 0`\n* `x3 >= 0`\n* `d1 > 0`\n* `d2 > 0`\n* `d3 > 0`\n* `c1` is a Boolean value\n* `c2` is a Boolean value\n\nThese loop invariants are true because the loop body only modifies `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` by subtracting `d1`, `d2`, or `d3` from them, and the loop condition checks if `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` are all greater than 0.\n\n3. After the loop termination:\nWe can say that the following loop invariant is true after the loop termination:\n* `x1 == 0 && x2 == 0 && x3 == 0`\n\nThis loop invariant is true because the loop terminates when `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` are all equal to 0.\n\nTherefore, the necessary loop invariants for the while loop in the program are:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant x1 >= 0;\n    loop invariant x2 >= 0;\n    loop invariant x3 >= 0;\n    loop invariant d1 > 0;\n    loop invariant d2 > 0;\n    loop invariant d3 > 0;\n    loop invariant c1 is a Boolean value;\n    loop invariant c2 is a Boolean value;\n    loop invariant x1 == 0 && x2 == 0 && x3 == 0;\n*/\n```\nThese loop invariants imply the post-condition `x1 == 0 && x2 == 0 && x3 == 0`, which is the desired property of the program."
