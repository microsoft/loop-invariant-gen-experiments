After the loop termination, the loop condition `j < n` is false.\n4. Before the loop execution, the value of `x` is equal to the value of `y`.\n5. In every iteration of the loop, the value of `x` is equal to the value of `y`.\n6. After the loop termination, the value of `x` is equal to the value of `y`.\n\nThese loop invariants imply the post-condition that the value of `x + y` is equal to `k`.\n\nACSL Annotations:\nWe can annotate the loop with the following ACSL annotations to specify the loop invariants:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant j < n;\n    loop invariant x == y;\n    loop invariant j < n ==> x == y;\n*/\n```\nThe first annotation specifies that the loop condition `j < n` is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nThe second annotation specifies that the value of `x` is equal to the value of `y` before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nThe third annotation specifies that if the loop condition `j < n` is true, then the value of `x` is equal to the value of `y`. This annotation is necessary because the loop body may modify the value of `x` and `y` in certain cases.\n\nNote that we have not used any variables or functions that are not declared in the program, and we have not made any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given. We have also not used any keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops."

            "content": " To find the necessary loop invariants for the while loop in the program, we need to analyze the loop body and the loop condition.\n\n1. Loop Body:\nThe loop body consists of two conditional statements:\n```scss\nif(j==i) {\n    x++;\n    y--;\n} else {\n    y++;\n    x--;\n}\n```\nThese statements update the values of `x` and `y` based on the value of `j` and `i`.\n2. Loop Condition:\nThe loop condition is `j < n`. This means that the loop will continue executing until `j` is greater than or equal to `n`.\n\nNow, let's identify the necessary loop invariants to help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program:\n\n1. Loop Invariant (1):\nBefore the loop execution, we can assume that `x + y == k`. This is because the loop condition is based on the value of `j`, which is initialized to 0, and the loop body updates `x` and `y` based on the value of `j`. Therefore, we can assume that `x + y == k` before the loop execution.\n2. Loop Invariant (2):\nIn every iteration of the loop, we can assume that `x + y == k`. This is because the loop body updates `x` and `y` based on the value of `j`, which is updated in each iteration of the loop. Therefore, we can assume that `x + y == k` in every iteration of the loop.\n3. Loop Invariant (3):\nAfter the loop termination, we can assume that `x + y == k`. This is because the loop condition is based on the value of `j`, which is updated in each iteration of the loop, and the loop body updates `x` and `y` based on the value of `j`. Therefore, we can assume that `x + y == k` after the loop termination.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the necessary loop invariants for the while loop in the program are:\n```scss\n/*@\n    loop invariant (1): x + y == k;\n    loop invariant (2): x + y == k;\n    loop invariant (3): x + y == k;\n*/\n```\nNote that these loop invariants are necessary to help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program, which is `x + y == k`."
