A loop invariant is a condition that is true before the loop, and remains true after each iteration of the loop.\n\nFrom the loop body, we can see that `i` is incremented by 2 in each iteration, and `j` is decremented by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, we can conclude that `i` is always even, and `j` is always odd.\n\nWe can also see that `j` is always greater than or equal to `i`. Therefore, we can conclude that `j - i` is always positive.\n\nNow, let's find the necessary loop invariants to help Frama-C verify the post-condition. The post-condition is `(j == 13)`.\n\nFrom the loop invariants we found, we can see that `j - i` is always positive, and `j` is always odd. Therefore, we can conclude that `j` is always greater than or equal to `i`.\n\nSo, the necessary loop invariants to help Frama-C verify the post-condition are:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant (j - i >= 0);\n    loop invariant (j % 2 == 1);\n*/\n```\nThese loop invariants imply that `j` is always greater than or equal to `i`, and `j` is always odd. Therefore, we can conclude that `j == 13` is true."

The loop will terminate when `j` becomes less than or equal to `i`.\n\nTo find the loop invariants, we need to identify the necessary conditions that must be true before the loop execution, during each iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nHere are the loop invariants for the while loop in the program:\n```scss\n/*@\n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nThe first loop invariant `i1` is that the variable `i` must always be greater than or equal to 1. This is because the loop starts with `i = 1`, and the loop body increments `i` by 2 in each iteration. Therefore, `i` will always be greater than or equal to 1.\n\nThe second loop invariant `i2` is that the variable `j` must always be greater than or equal to 1. This is because the loop starts with `j = 20`, and the loop body decrements `j` by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, `j` will always be greater than or equal to 1.\n\nThe third loop invariant `i3` is that the variable `i` must always be less than or equal to `j`. This is because the loop condition is `j >= i`, and the loop body increments `i` by 2 in each iteration. Therefore, `i` will always be less than or equal to `j`.\n\nThe fourth loop invariant `i4` is that the variable `j` must always be less than or equal to 20. This is because the loop starts with `j = 20`, and the loop body decrements `j` by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, `j` will always be less than or equal to 20.\n\nThe fifth loop invariant `i5` is that the variable `i` must always be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `j`. This is because the loop starts with `i = 1`, and the loop body increments `i` by 2 in each iteration. Therefore, `i` will always be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `j`.\n\nThe sixth loop invariant `i6` is that the variable `j` must always be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 20. This is because the loop starts with `j = 20`, and the loop body decrements `j` by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, `j` will always be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 20.\n\nThe seventh loop invariant `i7` is that the variable `i` must always be less than or equal to `j` and greater than or equal to 1. This is because the loop condition is `j >= i`, and the loop body increments `i` by 2 in each iteration. Therefore, `i` will always be less than or equal to `j` and greater than or equal to 1.\n\nThe eighth loop invariant `i8` is that the variable `j` must always be less than or equal to 20 and greater than or equal to 1. This is because the loop starts with `j = 20`, and the loop body decrements `j` by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, `j` will always be less than or equal to 20 and greater than or equal to 1.\n\nThe ninth loop invariant `i9` is that the variable `i` must always be less than or equal to `j` and greater than or equal to 1, and the variable `j` must always be less than or equal to 20 and greater than or equal to 1. This is because the loop condition is `j >= i`, and the loop body increments `i` by 2 in each iteration. Therefore, `i` will always be less than or equal to `j` and greater than or equal to 1, and `j` will always be less than or equal to 20 and greater"

The post-condition is `j == 13`.\n\nTo find the loop invariants, we need to analyze the loop body and the loop condition. We can start by analyzing the loop body.\n\nThe loop body has two statements: `i = i + 2` and `j = j - 1`. These statements can be simplified as `i = i + 2` and `j = j - 1`.\n\nNext, we need to analyze the loop condition. The loop condition is `j >= i`. This condition can be simplified as `j - i >= 0`.\n\nNow, we can start finding the loop invariants. A loop invariant is a condition that is true before the loop execution, during every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nBefore the loop execution, the loop invariant is `j - i >= 0`. During every iteration of the loop, the loop invariant is `j - i >= 0` and `i <= j`. After the loop termination, the loop invariant is `j - i >= 0` and `i == j`.\n\nWe can combine these loop invariants into a single loop invariant that is true before the loop execution, during every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. The loop invariant is `j - i >= 0` and `i <= j` and `i == j`.\n\nWe can simplify this loop invariant as `j - i >= 0` and `i <= j`. This loop invariant implies the post-condition `j == 13`.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the while loop in the program are `j - i >= 0` and `i <= j`.",

The post-condition is `j == 13`.\n\nTo find the loop invariants, we need to analyze the loop body and the loop condition. We can start by analyzing the loop body.\n\nThe loop body has two statements: `i = i + 2` and `j = j - 1`. These statements can be simplified as `i = i + 2` and `j = j - 1`.\n\nNext, we need to analyze the loop condition. The loop condition is `j >= i`. This condition can be simplified as `j - i >= 0`.\n\nNow, we can start finding the loop invariants. A loop invariant is a condition that is true before the loop execution, during every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nBefore the loop execution, the loop invariant is `j - i >= 0`. During every iteration of the loop, the loop invariant is `j - i >= 0` and `i <= j`. After the loop termination, the loop invariant is `j - i >= 0` and `i == j`.\n\nWe can combine these loop invariants into a single loop invariant that is true before the loop execution, during every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. The loop invariant is `j - i >= 0` and `i <= j` and `i == j`.\n\nWe can simplify this loop invariant as `j - i >= 0` and `i <= j`. This loop invariant implies the post-condition `j == 13`.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the while loop in the program are `j - i >= 0` and `i <= j`.",
