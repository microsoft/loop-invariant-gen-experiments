The loop continues to execute as long as `unknown()` returns a non-zero value.\n\nLoop Body:\nThe loop body consists of a single if statement. If the condition `i < y` is true, the loop increments `i` by 1.\n\nAssumptions:\nThe program makes the following assumptions:\n\n* `x >= 0`\n* `y >= 0`\n* `x >= y`\n\nInvariants:\nBased on the loop body and the assumptions, we can derive the following invariants:\n\n* `i >= 0` (from the loop condition)\n* `x >= 0` (from the assumption)\n* `y >= 0` (from the assumption)\n* `i < y` (from the loop body)\n* `i + 1 >= 0` (from the loop body)\n* `i + 1 < y` (from the loop body)\n\nWe can combine these invariants to form a single loop invariant that is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination:\n\n* `i >= 0 && x >= 0 && y >= 0 && i < y && i + 1 >= 0 && i + 1 < y`\n\nThis loop invariant implies that `i >= y`, which is the post-condition that we want to verify.\n\nNote that we have used implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code, and we have added conjunctions that bound the maximum and minimum values that the variables can take.

The loop increments the variable `i` if `i < y`, and the loop body also has some `assume` statements that provide bounds on the variables `x`, `y`, and `i`. The program also has a post-condition `assert` statement that checks if `i >= y`.\n\nTo find the loop invariants for this loop, we need to identify the conditions that are true before the loop starts, during each iteration of the loop, and after the loop terminates.\n\n1. Before the loop starts:\nThe loop starts with `i = 0`, and the `assume` statements provide bounds on `x`, `y`, and `i`. Therefore, we can say that before the loop starts, the following conditions are true:\n* `i == 0`\n* `x >= 0`\n* `y >= 0`\n* `i <= x` (since `i` is initialized to 0 and `x` is non-negative)\n* `i <= y` (since `i` is initialized to 0 and `y` is non-negative)\n* `i < y` (since `i` is initialized to 0 and `y` is non-negative)\n1. During each iteration of the loop:\nThe loop body increments `i` if `i < y`, and the loop condition is `unknown()`. Therefore, during each iteration of the loop, we can say that the following conditions are true:\n* `i < y` (since `i` is incremented by 1 if `i < y`)\n* `x >= 0` (since `x` is non-negative)\n* `y >= 0` (since `y` is non-negative)\n* `i <= x` (since `i` is incremented by 1 if `i < y`)\n* `i <= y` (since `i` is incremented by 1 if `i < y`)\n1. After the loop terminates:\nThe loop terminates when the condition `unknown()` is true. Therefore, after the loop terminates, we can say that the following conditions are true:\n* `i >= x` (since the loop body increments `i` by 1 if `i < y`, and `x` is non-negative)\n* `0 > i` (since the loop body increments `i` by 1 if `i < y`, and `i` is initialized to 0)\n* `i >= y` (since the loop body increments `i` by 1 if `i < y`, and `y` is non-negative)\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the while loop in the program are:\n\n1. Before the loop starts:\n`i == 0`\n`x >= 0`\n`y >= 0`\n`i <= x`\n`i <= y`\n`i < y`\n1. During each iteration of the loop:\n`i < y`\n`x >= 0`\n`y >= 0`\n`i <= x`\n`i <= y`\n1. After the loop terminates:\n`i >= x`\n`0 > i`\n`i >= y`\n\nNote that the loop invariants are conjunctions of the conditions that are true before the loop starts, during each iteration of the loop, and after the loop terminates. We can use these loop invariants to verify the post-condition `assert(i >= y)` using Frama-C.",
