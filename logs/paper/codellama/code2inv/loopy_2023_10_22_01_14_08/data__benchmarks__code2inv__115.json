We can use implication to make the loop invariants trivially true when `unknown()` is false, which is the case when the loop is not executed.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can define the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant (x == sn);\n    loop invariant (x >= 0);\n    loop invariant (sn >= 0);\n    loop invariant (x <= sn);\n    loop invariant (sn <= x);\n*/\n```\nThese loop invariants ensure that the values of `x` and `sn` are equal, and that they are both non-negative.

However, we can use implication to make the loop invariants imply the post-condition.\n\nFor example, we can add the following implication to the loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant (x == sn) ==> (sn == x);\n    loop invariant (x >= 0) ==> (x <= sn);\n    loop invariant (sn >= 0) ==> (sn <= x);\n    loop invariant (x <= sn) ==> (x == sn);\n    loop invariant (sn <= x) ==> (sn == x);\n*/\n```\nThese implications ensure that the loop invariants imply the post-condition of the program."

To find the necessary loop invariants for this loop, we need to analyze the loop body and the loop condition.\n\nLoop Body:\nThe loop body consists of two statements:\n\n* `x = x + 1`\n* `sn = sn + 1`\n\nBoth of these statements are simple assignments, and they do not introduce any new variables or functions.\n\nLoop Condition:\nThe loop condition is `unknown()`, which is a function that returns an integer. We do not know the implementation of this function, so we cannot make any assumptions about its behavior. However, we can assume that it returns a non-zero value if the loop should continue executing, and it returns 0 if the loop should terminate.\n\nLoop Invariants:\nTo find the necessary loop invariants, we need to analyze the loop body and the loop condition. We can start by identifying the variables that are modified in the loop body, which are `x` and `sn`. We can then use these variables to find the necessary loop invariants.\n\n1. Before the loop execution, the value of `x` is 0, and the value of `sn` is also 0.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, the value of `x` is incremented by 1, and the value of `sn` is also incremented by 1.\n3. After the loop termination, the value of `x` is equal to the value of `sn`.\n\nWe can express these loop invariants using ACSL annotations as follows:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant x == 0;\n    loop invariant sn == 0;\n    loop invariant x == sn;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used the `==` operator to compare the values of `x` and `sn`, which is the equality operator in ACSL. We have also used the `;` character to separate the loop invariants.\n\nIf we want to use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code, we can modify the loop invariants as follows:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant x == 0;\n    loop invariant sn == 0;\n    loop invariant x == sn ==> sn != -1;\n*/\n```\nThis code uses the implication operator (`==>`) to express the relationship between the loop invariants and the condition `sn != -1`. If the condition is true, then the loop invariants are also true. If the condition is false, then the loop invariants may or may not be true.\n\nFinally, we can add conjunctions to bound the maximum and minimum values that the variables `x` and `sn` can take. For example:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant x <= 10;\n    loop invariant sn >= 0;\n    loop invariant sn <= 10;\n    loop invariant x == sn ==> sn != -1;\n*/\n```\nThis code adds conjunctions to bound the values of `x` and `sn` between 0 and 10. We have also used the implication operator to express the relationship between the loop invariants and the condition `sn != -1`."
