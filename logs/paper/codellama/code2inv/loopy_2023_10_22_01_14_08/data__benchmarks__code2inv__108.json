If it is, then `m` is assigned the value of `a`.\n* The loop condition is `k < c`.\n\nNow, let's find the loop invariants:\n\n1. Before the loop execution, the loop invariant is:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= a <= m;\n*/\n```\nThis invariant is true before the loop execution because `a` is assigned the value `0` and `m` is assigned the value `0`, which means `0 <= a <= m` is true.\n\n2. In every iteration of the loop, the loop invariant is:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= a <= m;\n    loop invariant k < c;\n*/\n```\nThis invariant is true in every iteration of the loop because `a` and `m` are not modified in the loop body, and `k` is incremented by `1` in each iteration, which means `0 <= a <= m` and `k < c` are true in every iteration.\n\n3. After the loop termination, the loop invariant is:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= a <= m;\n    loop invariant k < c;\n    loop invariant m <= a;\n*/\n```\nThis invariant is true after the loop termination because `m` is assigned the value of `a` in the loop body if `m` is less than `a`, which means `m <= a` is true after the loop termination.\n\nNote that the loop invariants are conjunctions of the form `P ==> Q`, where `P` is the pre-condition and `Q` is the post-condition. The loop invariants are used to verify the post-condition of the loop."
