The loop invariant is a property that is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nFrom the program, we can see that the loop invariant for the while loop is:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant 1 <= x <= n; @*/\n```\nThis loop invariant states that the value of x is always between 1 and n, inclusive.\n\nNow, let's think about the post-condition of the program. The post-condition is the property that is true after the program terminates. From the program, we can see that the post-condition is:\n```\n/*@ assert(y <= n); @*/\n```\nThis post-condition states that the value of y is less than or equal to n.\n\nNow, let's think about how we can use the loop invariant to verify the post-condition. We can use the loop invariant to imply the post-condition by using implication. The implication is a logical operator that states that if the loop invariant is true, then the post-condition is true.\n\nSo, we can write the loop invariant and post-condition in the following way:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant 1 <= x <= n; @*/\n/*@ assert(y <= n); @*/\n```\nThis implies that if the loop invariant is true, then the post-condition is true.\n\nNow, let's think about the conditional nature of the code. The loop is guarded by a condition, which is `x <= n`. We can use this condition to make the loop invariant and post-condition more specific.\n\nFor example, we can write the loop invariant and post-condition in the following way:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant 1 <= x <= n and x <= n; @*/\n/*@ assert(y <= n and x <= n); @*/\n```\nThis implies that if the loop invariant is true and the condition `x <= n` is true, then the post-condition is true.\n\nFinally, let's think about the maximum and minimum values that the variables can take. We can use conjunctions to bound the maximum and minimum values that the variables can take.\n\nFor example, we can write the loop invariant and post-condition in the following way:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant 1 <= x <= n and x <= n and 0 <= y <= n; @*/\n/*@ assert(y <= n and x <= n); @*/\n```\nThis implies that if the loop invariant is true, the condition `x <= n` is true, and the values of x and y are within the bounds of 0 and n, then the post-condition is true.\n\nIn summary, the loop invariants for the while loop in the program are:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant 1 <= x <= n and x <= n and 0 <= y <= n; @*/\n/*@ assert(y <= n and x <= n); @*/\n```\nThese loop invariants imply the post-condition of the program, which is that the value of y is less than or equal to n."

We can write the loop invariants as:\n\n* `x = 1 ==> x <= n`\n* `x <= n ==> y = n - x`\n* `y = n - x ==> x > n`\n* `x > n ==> y <= n`\n\nWe can also add conjunctions that bound the maximum and minimum values that `x` and `y` can take:\n\n* `x >= 1` and `x <= n`\n* `y >= n - x` and `y <= n`\n\nFinally, we can use the loop invariants to verify the post-condition `y <= n`:\n\n* `x = 1 ==> x <= n`\n* `x <= n ==> y = n - x`\n* `y = n - x ==> x > n`\n* `x > n ==> y <= n`\n\nTherefore, the necessary loop invariants for the while loop in the given program are:\n\n* `x = 1 ==> x <= n`\n* `x <= n ==> y = n - x`\n* `y = n - x ==> x > n`\n* `x > n ==> y <= n`\n\nNote that we have used implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code, and we have added conjunctions that bound the maximum and minimum values that `x` and `y` can take.",
