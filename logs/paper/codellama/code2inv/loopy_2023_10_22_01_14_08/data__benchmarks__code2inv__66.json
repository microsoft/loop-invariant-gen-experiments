Loop Body:\nThe loop body consists of two statements: `y = 100 - x;` and `x = x + 1;`.\nFrom these statements, we can infer the following loop invariants:\n* `x` is always less than or equal to 100.\n* `y` is always greater than or equal to 0.\n* `y` is always less than or equal to 100.\n2. Post-Condition:\nThe post-condition is `assert(y < 100);`.\nFrom this post-condition, we can infer the following loop invariant:\n* `y` is always less than 100.\n\nNow, we can combine these loop invariants to form the final loop invariants for the while loop:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant x <= 100;\n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n    loop invariant y <= 100;\n    loop invariant y < 100;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used implication (==>) instead of using if-then to take care of the conditional nature of the code.

We also need to consider the pre-conditions and variable assignments in the program.\n\nFirst, let's identify the variables that are involved in the loop:\n\n* `x`: the loop variable, initialized to 1 and incremented by 1 in each iteration\n* `y`: the variable that stores the result of `100 - x` in each iteration\n\nNext, let's analyze the loop body:\n```\ny = 100 - x;\nx = x + 1;\n```\nThe loop body consists of two statements:\n\n1. `y = 100 - x`: This statement assigns the result of `100 - x` to `y`. Since `x` is initialized to 1 and incremented by 1 in each iteration, the value of `x` will be between 1 and 100 (inclusive). Therefore, the value of `y` will be between -100 and 1 (inclusive).\n2. `x = x + 1`: This statement increments `x` by 1 in each iteration. Since `x` is initialized to 1 and incremented by 1 in each iteration, the value of `x` will be between 1 and 100 (inclusive).\n\nNow, let's consider the loop condition:\n```\nwhile (x <= 100)\n```\nThe loop condition states that the loop will continue to execute as long as `x` is less than or equal to 100. Since `x` is initialized to 1 and incremented by 1 in each iteration, the loop will terminate when `x` reaches 100.\n\nFinally, let's consider the post-condition:\n```\n{;\n//@ assert(y < 100);\n}\n```\nThe post-condition states that `y` is less than 100. Since `y` is assigned the result of `100 - x` in each iteration, and `x` is initialized to 1 and incremented by 1 in each iteration, `y` will be less than 100 when the loop terminates.\n\nNow that we have analyzed the loop body, loop condition, and post-condition, we can identify the necessary loop invariants for the while loop. The loop invariants are the conditions that must be true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nHere are the loop invariants for the while loop in the program:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 1;\n    loop invariant x <= 100;\n    loop invariant y >= -100;\n    loop invariant y <= 1;\n    loop invariant y < 100;\n*/\n```\nThe first three loop invariants ensure that `x` is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `y` is between -100 and 1 (inclusive), and `y` is less than 100. The last two loop invariants ensure that `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration and that `y` is assigned the result of `100 - x` in each iteration.\n\nNote that we have used implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. We have also added conjunctions that bound the maximum and minimum values that `x` and `y` can take, and have added a conjunction for their relation. Finally, we have used the guard condition in an implication to make the invariant trivially true at the beginning and end of the loop."

We can also assume that `y` is equal to 100 - 1 = 99, since it is updated in the loop body before the first iteration.\n\nIn every iteration of the loop, we can assume that `x` is less than or equal to 100, since the loop condition checks for this condition. We can also assume that `y` is equal to 100 - `x`, since it is updated in the loop body at the end of each iteration.\n\nAfter the loop termination, we can assume that `x` is equal to 100, since the loop terminates when `x` is greater than 100. We can also assume that `y` is equal to 100 - 100 = 0, since it is updated in the loop body at the end of the last iteration.\n\nTo summarize, the loop invariants for the while loop in the program are:\n\n* Before the loop execution, `x` is equal to 1 and `y` is equal to 99.\n* In every iteration of the loop, `x` is less than or equal to 100 and `y` is equal to 100 - `x`.\n* After the loop termination, `x` is equal to 100 and `y` is equal to 0.\n\nWe can express these loop invariants using ACSL annotations as follows:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nNote that we are using implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code, and we are adding conjunctions that bound the maximum and minimum values that `x` and `y` can take. We are also adding a conjunction for the relation between `x` and `y`."
