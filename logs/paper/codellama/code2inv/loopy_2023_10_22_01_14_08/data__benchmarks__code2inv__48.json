To find the loop invariants, we need to analyze the loop body and the loop condition.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the loop body:\n\nThe loop body has two if statements, each with a nested if statement. The first if statement checks if `c != n`, and if it is, it increments `c` by 1. The second if statement checks if `c == n`, and if it is, it sets `c` to 1.\n\nBased on the loop body, we can infer the following loop invariants:\n\n* `c` is always less than or equal to `n`\n* `c` is always greater than or equal to 1\n* If `c == n`, then `c` is equal to 1\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop condition:\n\nThe loop condition is `unknown()`, which is a function that returns a non-deterministic value. We cannot make any assumptions about the value returned by this function. However, we can use the implication operator (==>) to take care of the conditional nature of the code.\n\nBased on the loop condition, we can infer the following loop invariant:\n\n* If `unknown()` returns a value that is not equal to 0, then `c` is less than or equal to `n`\n\nFinally, let's consider the post-condition:\n\nThe post-condition is `c == n`. We can use the loop invariants we derived earlier to prove this post-condition.\n\nTo prove the post-condition, we can use the following loop invariant:\n\n* If `c == n`, then `c` is equal to 1\n\nThis loop invariant implies that if `c == n`, then `c` is equal to 1, which in turn implies that `c` is less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, we can conclude that if `c == n`, then `c` is less than or equal to `n`, which is the desired post-condition.\n\nHere are the loop invariants for the while loop in the program:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant c <= n;\n    loop invariant c >= 1;\n    loop invariant if c == n then c == 1;\n    loop invariant if unknown() != 0 then c <= n;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used implication (==>) to take care of the conditional nature of the code. We have also used conjunctions to bound the maximum and minimum values that the variables `c` and `n` can take, and to express the relation between `c` and `n`."

The loop condition is also an unknown function call.\n\nTo find the loop invariants, we need to reason about the behavior of the loop.

We can do this by adding an implication to the loop invariants that takes into account the post-condition.
