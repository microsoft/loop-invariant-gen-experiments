We can use these pre-conditions to help us find the loop invariants.\n\nThe post-condition of the loop is that `c` is equal to `n`.\n\nBased on the loop body and the pre-conditions, we can find the following loop invariants:\n\n1. Before the loop execution, `c` is initialized to 0, so the loop invariant `c == 0` is true.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, if `c` is not equal to `n`, then `c` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the loop invariant `c <= n` is true in every iteration of the loop.\n3. If `c` is equal to `n`, then the loop terminates and `c` is set to 1.

The loop also checks the condition `c == n` and sets `c` to 1 if that condition is true.\n\nThe loop invariants are the conditions that must be true before, during, and after the loop execution. To find the loop invariants, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Identify the variables that are modified in the loop body. In this case, the variable `c` is modified.\n2. Identify the conditions that are checked in the loop body. In this case, the conditions `c != n` and `c == n` are checked.\n3. Use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. For example, if the loop body sets `c` to 1 if `c == n`, then we can use the implication `(c == n) ==> (c = 1)` to express the loop invariant.\n4. Add conjunctions that bound the maximum and minimum values that the modified variables can take, if such bounds exist. In this case, we can add the conjunction `0 <= c <= n` to bound the value of `c`.\n5. If a variable is always equal to or smaller or larger than another variable, add a conjunction for their relation. In this case, we can add the conjunction `c <= n` to express the relationship between `c` and `n`.\n6. If the assertion is guarded by a condition, use the guard condition in an implication. In this case, we can use the implication `c < 0 ==> (c == n)` to express the loop invariant.\n7. If certain variables are non-deterministic at the beginning or end of the loop, use an implication to make the invariant trivially true at that location. In this case, we can use the implication `c == n ==> (c == n)` to make the invariant trivially true at the end of the loop.\n\nUsing this approach, we can find the loop invariants for the loop in the program as follows:\n```\n/*@\n  loop invariant 0 <= c <= n;\n  loop invariant c <= n;\n  loop invariant c == n ==> (c == n);\n  loop invariant c < 0 ==> (c == n);\n*/\n```\nThese loop invariants express the necessary conditions for the loop to terminate with `c` equal to `n`."
