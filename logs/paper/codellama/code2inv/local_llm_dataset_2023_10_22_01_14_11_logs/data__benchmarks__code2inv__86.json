In this case, the only variable that is modified in the loop body is `x`, and the only variable that is used in the loop condition is `x`.\n\nWe can start by identifying the loop invariant that is true before the loop execution. Since `x` is initialized to `-50`, we can assume that `x` is less than 0 before the loop execution. Therefore, a loop invariant that is true before the loop execution is:\n```scss\n/*@ loop invariant x < 0; @*/\n```\nNext, we can identify the loop invariant that is true in every iteration of the loop. Since `x` is incremented by `y` in the loop body, we can assume that `x` is less than or equal to `y` in every iteration of the loop. Therefore, a loop invariant that is true in every iteration of the loop is:\n```scss\n/*@ loop invariant x <= y; @*/\n```\nFinally, we can identify the loop invariant that is true after the loop termination. Since `y` is incremented by 1 in the loop body, we can assume that `y` is greater than or equal to 1 after the loop termination. Therefore, a loop invariant that is true after the loop termination is:\n```scss\n/*@ loop invariant y >= 1; @*/\n```\nTo make the loop invariants imply the post-condition, we can use implication to combine the loop invariants with the post-condition. For example, we can use the following implication to make the loop invariants imply the post-condition:\n```scss\n/*@ loop invariant x < 0 ==> y > 0; @*/\n```\nThis implication states that if `x` is less than 0, then `y` is greater than 0.

To find the necessary loop invariants for this loop, we need to analyze the loop body and the loop condition.\n\nThe loop body consists of two statements:\n```\nx  = (x + y);\ny  = (y + 1);\n```\nThe loop condition is `x < 0`.\n\nFrom the loop body, we can see that the value of `x` is being incremented by `y` in each iteration, and the value of `y` is being incremented by 1. Therefore, we can infer that the loop invariants should include the following:\n\n* `x` is always smaller than or equal to `y`\n* `y` is always greater than or equal to 1\n* `x` is always smaller than or equal to -50\n\nFrom the loop condition, we can see that the loop will terminate when `x` is greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, we can infer that the loop invariants should also include the following:\n\n* `x` is always greater than or equal to 0\n\nNow, let's combine these loop invariants into one code block:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x <= y;\n    loop invariant y >= 1;\n    loop invariant x <= -50;\n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used the ACSL notation to specify the loop invariants. The `loop invariant` keyword is used to specify the invariant, and the `;` character is used to separate each invariant.\n\nFinally, we can use the loop invariants to prove the post-condition of the loop, which is `y > 0`. We can do this by using the implication operator (`==>`) to state that if the loop invariants hold, then the post-condition holds. The post-condition is stated using the `assert` keyword. Therefore, we can prove the post-condition by writing the following code:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x <= y;\n    loop invariant y >= 1;\n    loop invariant x <= -50;\n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    assert(y > 0) ==> (x <= y && y >= 1 && x <= -50 && x >= 0);\n*/\n```\nThis code specifies the loop invariants and the post-condition, and it uses the implication operator to prove that the post-condition holds if the loop invariants hold."

We can start by identifying the variables that are modified within the loop body, which are `x`, `y`, and `z1`, `z2`, `z3`.\n\nNext, we need to identify the loop condition, which is `x < 0`. This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as `x` is less than 0.\n\nNow, we can start thinking about the loop invariants. A loop invariant is a condition that is true before the loop starts, is true after each iteration of the loop, and is true after the loop terminates. In this case, we need to find loop invariants that imply the post-condition `(y > 0)`.\n\nOne possible loop invariant is `y >= 0`. This invariant is true before the loop starts, as `y` is initialized to 0. It is also true after each iteration of the loop, as `y` is incremented by 1 in each iteration. And it is true after the loop terminates, as `x` is always less than 0, which means `y` will always be greater than or equal to 0.\n\nAnother possible loop invariant is `x <= 0`. This invariant is true before the loop starts, as `x` is initialized to -50. It is also true after each iteration of the loop, as `x` is incremented by `y` in each iteration, which means `x` will always be less than or equal to 0. And it is true after the loop terminates, as `x` is always less than 0, which means it will always be less than or equal to 0.\n\nWe can also add conjunctions to bound the maximum and minimum values that `x`, `y`, and `z1`, `z2`, `z3` can take. For example, we can add the conjunction `x >= -50` to bound the minimum value of `x`, and `y >= 0` to bound the minimum value of `y`.\n\nFinally, we can use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. For example, we can add the implication `(x < 0) ==> (y > 0)` to the loop invariant `y >= 0`, which means that if `x` is less than 0, then `y` is greater than 0.\n\nHere are the loop invariants for the given program:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x <= 0;\n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n    loop invariant x >= -50;\n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n    loop invariant (x < 0) ==> (y > 0);\n*/\n```\nThese loop invariants imply the post-condition `(y > 0)`, which means that the loop will terminate with `y` being greater than 0."
