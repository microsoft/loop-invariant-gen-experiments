After the loop termination:\n\nThe loop invariants should be true after the loop termination. Since the loop condition is `(i <= size)`, we can use the following loop invariant:\n```scss\ni <= size;\n```\nThis loop invariant is true after the loop termination.\n\nNow, we need to make sure that the loop invariants imply the post-condition. The post-condition is `(sn == size)`, which is guarded by the condition `(sn != size)`. We can use the following implication to make the loop invariants imply the post-condition:\n```scss\n(sn = 0) ==> (sn == size)\n```\nThis implication is true if `sn` is initialized to 0, which is the case before the loop execution.\n\nTherefore, the necessary loop invariants for the given program are:\n```scss\n/*@ \n    loop invariant sn = 0;\n    loop invariant i = 1;\n    loop invariant sn = sn + 1;\n    loop invariant i = i + 1;\n    loop invariant i <= size;\n*/\n```\nThese loop invariants are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination, such that the loop invariants imply the post-condition."

After the loop termination, `sn = size`.\n\nWe can express these loop invariants in ACSL annotations as follows:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant sn = 0 && i = 1;\n    loop invariant i <= size && sn = sn + 1;\n    loop invariant sn = size;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used the conjunction operator (`&&`) to combine the loop invariants. Also, we have used the `loop invariant` keyword to indicate that these are loop invariants.\n\nNow, we can use these loop invariants to verify the post-condition. We can use the `assert` keyword to make the post-condition true.\n\nFor example, we can use the following ACSL annotation to verify the post-condition:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant sn = 0 && i = 1;\n    loop invariant i <= size && sn = sn + 1;\n    loop invariant sn = size;\n    assert(sn == size);\n*/\n```\nThis will ensure that the post-condition is true if the loop terminates successfully."
