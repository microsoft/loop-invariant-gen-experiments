Therefore, the loop invariant for the loop condition is `unknown() == 0`.\n\nThe loop invariants for the while loop are `c == n`, `c != n`, and `unknown() == 0`.

For example, we can add the conjunction `0 <= c <= n` to the loop invariant `c == n` to ensure that `c` is non-negative and less than or equal to `n`.\n\nFinally, we can add an implication to the loop invariant `c != n` to make it trivially true at the beginning of the loop, since `c` is initialized to 0.

The loop body modifies the variable `c` based on the value of `n`. The program also has an assertion `assert( c >= 0)` that is guarded by the condition `c == n`.\n\nTo find the loop invariants, we need to analyze the loop body and the assertion. The loop body modifies the variable `c` in two ways:\n\n1. If `c == n`, then `c` is set to 1.\n2. Otherwise, `c` is incremented by 1.\n\nWe can represent the loop body as follows:\n```\nc = (c == n ? 1 : c + 1)\n```\nThe assertion `assert( c >= 0)` is guarded by the condition `c == n`. We can represent this as follows:\n```\nif (c == n) {\n    assert(c >= 0);\n}\n```\nNow, let's find the loop invariants.\n\n(i) Before the loop execution, the variable `c` is not initialized. Therefore, we cannot make any assumptions about its value. However, we can add a conjunction that bounds the maximum value that `c` can take.\n```\nc <= n\n```\n(ii) In every iteration of the loop, the variable `c` is modified based on the value of `n`. We can represent this as follows:\n```\nc = (c == n ? 1 : c + 1)\n```\n(iii) After the loop termination, the variable `c` is equal to `n` if the assertion is true. We can represent this as follows:\n```\nif (c == n) {\n    assert(c >= 0);\n}\n```\nNow, let's combine the loop invariants. We can represent the loop invariants as follows:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant c <= n;\n    loop invariant c = (c == n ? 1 : c + 1);\n    loop invariant if (c == n) { assert(c >= 0); };\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. We have also added conjunctions that bound the maximum and minimum values that the variables can take, if such bounds exist. Finally, we have used the guard condition in an implication to make the invariant trivially true at the beginning and end of the loop."
