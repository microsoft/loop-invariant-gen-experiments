Before the loop execution, the value of `x` is 0, and the value of `sn` is also 0.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, the value of `x` is incremented by 1, and the value of `sn` is also incremented by 1.\n3. After the loop termination, the value of `x` is equal to the value of `sn`.\n\nWe can express these loop invariants using ACSL annotations as follows:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant x == 0;\n    loop invariant sn == 0;\n    loop invariant x == sn;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used the `==` operator to compare the values of `x` and `sn`, which is the equality operator in ACSL. We have also used the `;` character to separate the loop invariants.\n\nIf we want to use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code, we can modify the loop invariants as follows:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant x == 0;\n    loop invariant sn == 0;\n    loop invariant x == sn ==> sn != -1;\n*/\n```\nThis code uses the implication operator (`==>`) to express the relationship between the loop invariants and the condition `sn != -1`. If the condition is true, then the loop invariants are also true. If the condition is false, then the loop invariants may or may not be true.\n\nFinally, we can add conjunctions to bound the maximum and minimum values that the variables `x` and `sn` can take. For example:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant x <= 10;\n    loop invariant sn >= 0;\n    loop invariant sn <= 10;\n    loop invariant x == sn ==> sn != -1;\n*/\n```\nThis code adds conjunctions to bound the values of `x` and `sn` between 0 and 10. We have also used the implication operator to express the relationship between the loop invariants and the condition `sn != -1`."
