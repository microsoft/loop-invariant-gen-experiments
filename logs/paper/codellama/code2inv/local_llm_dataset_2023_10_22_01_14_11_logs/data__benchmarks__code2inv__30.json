This means that `x` is always greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to `INT_MAX` in each iteration of the loop.\n* `x` is equal to 0 after the loop terminates, and `x` is less than or equal to `INT_MAX`. This means that `x` is equal to 0 when the loop condition becomes false, and `x` is less than or equal to `INT_MAX` after the loop terminates.\n\nNow, let's add conjunctions for the relation between `x` and other variables. We know that `x` is always greater than or equal to 0, so we can add the conjunction `x >= 0` to the loop invariants.\n\nThe loop invariants with conjunctions for the relation between `x` and other variables are:\n\n* `x` is a non-negative integer before the loop starts, and `x` is less than or equal to `INT_MAX`, and `x >= 0`. This means that `x` is always greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to `INT_MAX` before the loop starts.\n* `x` is a non-negative integer in every iteration of the loop, and `x` is less than or equal to `INT_MAX`, and `x >= 0`. This means that `x` is always greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to `INT_MAX` in each iteration of the loop.\n* `x` is equal to 0 after the loop terminates, and `x` is less than or equal to `INT_MAX`, and `x >= 0`. This means that `x` is equal to 0 when the loop condition becomes false, and `x` is less than or equal to `INT_MAX` after the loop terminates.\n\nNow, let's use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. We can use implication instead of using if-then statements.\n\nThe loop invariants with implication are:\n\n* `x` is a non-negative integer before the loop starts, and `"

For example, we can use the `==>` operator to indicate that the loop invariant is true if the loop condition is true.\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant (x >= 0 ==> x = x - 1);\n    loop invariant (x > 0 ==> x == 0);\n*/\n```\nThis way, we have expressed the loop invariants in a way that is compatible with ACSL annotations and can be used by Frama-C to verify the post-condition."
