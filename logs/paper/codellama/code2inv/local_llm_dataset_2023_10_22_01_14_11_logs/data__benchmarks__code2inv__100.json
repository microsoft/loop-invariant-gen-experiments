The loop body increments `y` and decrements `x`.\n\nTo find the loop invariants, we need to identify the variables that are modified within the loop and the variables that are used to control the loop. In this case, `x` and `y` are modified within the loop, and `n` is used to control the loop.\n\nWe can start by identifying the pre-conditions of the loop. The pre-conditions are the conditions that must be true before the loop is executed. In this case, the pre-condition is `n >= 0`.\n\nNext, we can identify the loop invariants. A loop invariant is a condition that must be true before, during, and after each iteration of the loop. In this case, the loop invariant is `y <= n`.\n\nTo prove that `y <= n` is a loop invariant, we can use the following argument:\n\n1. Before the loop is executed, `y` is equal to 0, so `y <= n` is true.\n2. During each iteration of the loop, `y` is incremented by 1, but `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, `y <= n` is still true.\n3. After the loop terminates, `y` is equal to `n`, so `y <= n` is true.\n\nTherefore, `y <= n` is a loop invariant for the loop in the program.\n\nTo make the loop invariant more precise, we can add conjunctions that bound the maximum and minimum values that `y` and `n` can take. For example, we can add the conjunction `0 <= y <= n` to bound the minimum and maximum values of `y`, and the conjunction `n >= 0` to bound the minimum value of `n`.\n\nFinally, we can use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. For example, we can use the implication `n >= 0 ==> y <= n` to make the loop invariant trivially true when `n` is negative.\n\nThe final loop invariants for the loop in the program are:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant 0 <= y <= n;\n    loop invariant n >= 0 ==> y <= n;\n*/\n```"

Therefore, `y` is always less than or equal to `n`.\n\nThe loop invariant `y == n` is true after the loop termination because the loop terminates when `x` becomes 0, and `y` is incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop. Therefore, `y` is equal to `n` after the loop termination.\n\nNote that we have used implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code, and we have added conjunctions that bound the maximum and minimum values that the variables can take. We have also added conjunctions for the relations between the variables.
