Use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code: The assertion `assert(c >= 0)` is guarded by the condition `(c != n)`. We can use implication to make the invariant trivially true at the beginning of the loop and at the end of the loop. For example, we can add the invariant `c >= 0` to the loop header and the invariant `c < n` to the loop footer.\n\nHere are the loop invariants for the loop in the program:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant c >= 0;\n    loop invariant c < n;\n    loop invariant n > 0;\n    loop invariant n < MAX_INT;\n    loop invariant c <= n;\n*/\n```\nNote that the loop invariants are expressed as conjunctions of conditions that are always true before, during, and after the loop. The `assume` statements are used to make the loop invariants true at the beginning of the loop, and the `assert` statement is used to make the loop invariants true at the end of the loop."

            "content": " In this program, there is only one loop, which is the while loop. The loop body is executed zero or more times, depending on the value of the `unknown()` function. The loop invariant should be true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nTo find the loop invariant, we need to analyze the loop body and the condition of the loop. The loop body has two if-else statements, which are executed in every iteration of the loop. The first if-else statement checks whether `c` is not equal to `n`, and if it is not, it increments `c` by 1. The second if-else statement checks whether `c` is equal to `n`, and if it is, it sets `c` to 1.\n\nBased on the loop body, we can see that the loop invariant should be true in every iteration of the loop, and it should be true before the loop execution and after the loop termination. The loop invariant should also be true for all values of `c` and `n`.\n\nHere is one possible loop invariant for the loop:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant c >= 0;\n    loop invariant c <= n;\n    loop invariant (c == n) ==> (c >= 0);\n*/\n```\nThis loop invariant states that `c` is always greater than or equal to 0, `c` is always less than or equal to `n`, and if `c` is equal to `n`, then `c` is greater than or equal to 0. These conditions are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nThe assertion in the program is guarded by the condition `c != n`, which means that the assertion is only true if `c` is not equal to `n`. We can use this condition in an implication to make the loop invariant trivially true at the end of the loop, like this:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant c >= 0;\n    loop invariant c <= n;\n    loop invariant (c == n) ==> (c >= 0);\n    loop invariant (c != n) ==> (c >= 0);\n*/\n```\nThis loop invariant is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. It is also true for all values of `c` and `n`.\n\nNote that the loop invariant does not include any information about the `unknown()` function, because we are not allowed to use functions whose definitions are not given. Also, we are not allowed to use variables that have garbage values, so we cannot use the `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` variables in the loop invariant."
