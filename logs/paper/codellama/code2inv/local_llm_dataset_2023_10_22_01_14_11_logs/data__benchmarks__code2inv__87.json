The loop body consists of two branches: one for the case when `unknown()` returns `true`, and one for the case when `unknown()` returns `false`.\n\nIn the first branch, the loop invariant `lock  = 1` is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. This invariant is true because the loop invariant `lock  = 1` is true before the loop execution, and it is preserved in every iteration of the loop because the loop body does not modify the value of `lock`.\n\nIn the second branch, the loop invariant `lock  = 0` is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. This invariant is true because the loop invariant `lock  = 0` is true before the loop execution, and it is preserved in every iteration of the loop because the loop body does not modify the value of `lock`.\n\nNow, let's look at the loop condition. The loop condition is `(x != y)`. This condition is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. This condition is true because the loop invariant `x  = y` is true before the loop execution, and it is preserved in every iteration of the loop because the loop body does not modify the value of `x`.\n\nFinally, let's consider the post-condition of the loop, which is `(lock == 1)`. This post-condition is true after the loop termination, because the loop invariant `lock  = 1` is true before the loop execution, and it is preserved in every iteration of the loop.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclude that the necessary loop invariants for the while loop in the program above are:\n\n* `lock  = 1` before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination\n* `lock  = 0` before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination\n* `x  = y` before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination\n* `y  = (y + 1)` before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination\n\nThese loop invariants imply the post-condition `(lock == 1)`, which is the desired property of the loop."
