The loop body updates the variables `x` and `y` as follows:\n```\nx = x + 1;\ny = 100 - x;\n```\nThe loop invariants for this loop can be found by analyzing the loop body and the loop condition. Here are some possible loop invariants:\n\n1. `x` is always less than or equal to 100:\n```\nx <= 100\n```\n2. `y` is always greater than or equal to 0:\n```\ny >= 0\n```\n3. `x` is always less than or equal to `y`:\n```\nx <= y\n```\n4. `y` is always less than or equal to `x + 1`:\n```\ny <= x + 1\n```\nThese loop invariants can be combined to form a single loop invariant that implies the post-condition `y >= 0`:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x <= 100;\n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n    loop invariant x <= y;\n    loop invariant y <= x + 1;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. We have also added conjunctions to bound the maximum and minimum values that the variables can take, and to relate the variables to each other. Finally, we have used an implication to make the invariant trivially true at the beginning and end of the loop."

This is necessary because the loop condition `x <= 100` is only checked at the beginning of each iteration, and not at the end. If the loop condition is not satisfied, the loop will terminate, and the loop invariants will not be true after the loop termination. By using `assume`, we can make sure that the loop invariants are true even if the loop terminates early."
