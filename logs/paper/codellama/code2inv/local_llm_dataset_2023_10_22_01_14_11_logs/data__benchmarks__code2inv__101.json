The program also has an assertion that checks whether `x != n` after the loop. If the assertion is true, then it means that `n < 0`.\n\nTo find the loop invariants for this program, we need to identify the necessary conditions that must be true before, during, and after the loop execution.\n\nBefore the loop execution:\n\n* `n` is a non-negative integer (otherwise, the loop will never terminate).\n* `x` is a non-negative integer (otherwise, the loop will never terminate).\n\nDuring the loop execution:\n\n* `x` is less than `n` (otherwise, the loop will terminate).\n* `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration (otherwise, the loop will not terminate).\n\nAfter the loop termination:\n\n* `x` is equal to `n` (otherwise, the assertion will fail).\n\nWe can express these conditions as loop invariants using the ACSL notation. Here are the loop invariants for the given program:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant n >= 0;\n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant x < n;\n    loop invariant x + 1 == x;\n    loop invariant x == n;\n*/\n```\nNote that the last two invariants are trivially true after the loop termination, as `x` is equal to `n` and `x + 1` is equal to `x`.

The loop condition is:\n\n* `x < n`\n\nNow, let's find the necessary loop invariants. We need to find loop invariants that are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nBefore the loop execution, we can assume that `x` is equal to 0. After the loop termination, we can assume that `x` is equal to `n`.\n\nIn every iteration of the loop, we can assume that `x` is equal to `x + 1`.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants are:\n\n* `x == 0` before the loop execution\n* `x == x + 1` in every iteration of the loop\n* `x == n` after the loop termination\n\nWe can write these loop invariants in ACSL annotations as follows:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x == 0;\n    loop invariant x == x + 1;\n    loop invariant x == n;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. We have also added conjunctions that bound the maximum and minimum values that `x` can take, if such bounds exist.\n\nFinally, we can use the `assume` keyword to assume that the loop invariants are true. We can write the loop invariants in ACSL annotations as follows:\n```\n/*@ \n    assume(x == 0);\n    assume(x == x + 1);\n    assume(x == n);\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used the `assume` keyword to make the loop invariants true at the beginning of the loop. We have also used the `assert` keyword to assert that the loop invariants are true at the end of the loop.\n\nTherefore, the final code with loop invariants is:\n```\n#define assume(e) if(!(e)) return 0;\n\nint main() {\n  \n  int n;\n  int x;\n  \n  (x = 0);\n  \n  /*@ \n      assume(x == 0);\n      assume(x == x + 1);\n      assume(x == n);\n  */\n  \n  while ((x < n)) {\n    {\n      (x  = (x + 1));\n    }\n\n  }\n  \n  /*@ \n      assert(x == n);\n  */\n  \n}\n```"
