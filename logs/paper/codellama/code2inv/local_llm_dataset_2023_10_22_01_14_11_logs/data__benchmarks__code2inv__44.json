We can use the loop invariants to prove that `c` is not equal to `n` after the loop termination.\n\nFor example, if `c > n`, then `c <= 100` implies that `c != n`. If `c == n`, then `c >= -100` implies that `c != n`. Therefore, the loop invariants imply that `c != n` after the loop termination.\n\nWe can use the loop invariants to help Frama-C verify the post-condition. The post-condition is `c != n`.
