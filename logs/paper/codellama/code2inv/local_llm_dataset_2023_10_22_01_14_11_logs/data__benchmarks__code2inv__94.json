We can start by identifying the variables that are involved in the loop and their relationships.\n\nIn this case, the loop body increments the variable `i` by 1 and updates the variable `j` to be the sum of `j` and `i`. The loop condition is `i <= n`.\n\nTo find the loop invariants, we need to identify the conditions that are true before the loop, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop. We can use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code.\n\nHere are some potential loop invariants:\n\n* Before the loop, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and `n` is greater than or equal to 0.\n* In every iteration of the loop, `i` is less than or equal to `n`.\n* After the loop, `i` is equal to `n` and `j` is equal to the sum of `n` and `k`.\n\nWe can write these loop invariants in ACSL notation as follows:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i == 0 ==> i <= n;\n    loop invariant j == 0 ==> j <= n;\n    loop invariant n >= 0 ==> i <= n;\n    loop invariant j <= n ==> i + j == n;\n*/\n```\nNote that we are using the implication operator `==>` to make the invariants true only when the condition is true. We are also using conjunctions to bound the maximum and minimum values that the variables can take.\n\nWe can also add conjunctions that bound the maximum and minimum values that the variables can take, if such bounds exist. For example, if we know that `i` and `j` are always non-negative, we can add the conjunction `i >= 0` and `j >= 0`.\n\nFinally, we can use implication to make the invariant trivially true at the beginning and end of the loop. For example, we can add the invariant `i == 0 ==> i <= n` to make the invariant true at the beginning of the loop, and `i == n ==> i <= n` to make the invariant true at the end of the loop.\n\nOverall, the loop invariants we have identified can help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program, which is that `i + (j + k) > 2 * n`."
