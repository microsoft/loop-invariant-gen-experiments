The first part is the loop condition, which is `unknown()`. We can't say much about this condition, so we'll assume that it's always true.\n2. The second part is the loop body, which is executed if the loop condition is true. This part consists of two assignments: `z = z + 1` and `c = c + 1`.\n\nNow, let's analyze the post-condition:\n```\nif ( (c < 36) )\n{;\n//@ assert( (z < 4608) );\n}\n```\nThe post-condition is that `z` is less than 4608.\n\nBased on the analysis of the loop body and the post-condition, we can conclude that the loop invariants are:\n\n1. `c < 36`\n2. `z < 4608`\n3. `c >= 0`\n4. `z >= 0`\n5. `c <= 36`\n6. `z <= 4608`\n\nThese loop invariants are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination, respectively.\n\nHere are the loop invariants in code form:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant c < 36;\n    loop invariant z < 4608;\n    loop invariant c >= 0;\n    loop invariant z >= 0;\n    loop invariant c <= 36;\n    loop invariant z <= 4608;\n*/\n```\nNote that we've used the `loop invariant` keyword to indicate that these are loop invariants. We've also used the `<` and `>` operators to indicate the bounds of the variables."
