Before the loop execution, `x` and `m` are initialized to 1, so they are greater than or equal to 1. `n` is not initialized, but since it is used as a loop condition, we know that it is non-negative. Therefore, the loop invariants hold before the loop execution.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, `x` is incremented by 1, so it starts at 1 and ends at `n` or `n-1` depending on whether the loop terminates due to the condition being false or the unknown function returning 0 or non-zero. Therefore, `1 <= x <= n` holds in every iteration of the loop. If `m` is updated in any iteration, it is set to the current value of `x`, so `m == x` holds in that iteration.\n3. After the loop termination, `m >= 1` implies that `m` was updated at least once in the loop. Since `m` is set to the current value of `x` whenever `unknown()` returns non-zero, we know that `m` is the maximum value of `x` for which `unknown()` returned non-zero. Therefore, `n <= m` holds after the loop termination. We use implication because if `m < 1`, the assertion is always true.",

Also, if `unknown()` returns a non-zero value and sets `m` to `x`, then `m <= x` is true in that iteration.

Before the loop execution, `x` and `m` are initialized to 1, so they are greater than or equal to 1. `n` is not initialized, but since it is used as a loop condition, we know that it is non-negative. Therefore, the loop invariants hold before the loop execution.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, `x` is incremented by 1, so it starts at 1 and ends at `n` or `n-1` depending on whether the loop terminates due to the condition being false or the unknown function returning 0 or non-zero. Therefore, `1 <= x <= n` holds in every iteration of the loop. If `m` is updated in any iteration, it is set to the current value of `x`, so `m == x` holds in that iteration.\n3. After the loop termination, `m >= 1` implies that `m` was updated at least once in the loop. Since `m` is set to the current value of `x` whenever `unknown()` returns non-zero, we know that `m` is the maximum value of `x` for which `unknown()` returned non-zero. Therefore, `n <= m` holds after the loop termination. We use implication because if `m < 1`, the assertion is always true.",

Before the loop execution, `x` and `m` are initialized to 1, so they are greater than or equal to 1. `n` is not initialized, but since it is used as a loop condition, we know that it is non-negative. Therefore, the loop invariants hold before the loop execution.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, `x` is incremented by 1, so it starts at 1 and ends at `n` or `n-1` depending on whether the loop terminates due to the condition being false or the unknown function returning 0 or non-zero. Therefore, `1 <= x <= n` holds in every iteration of the loop. If `m` is updated in any iteration, it is set to the current value of `x`, so `m == x` holds in that iteration.\n3. After the loop termination, `m >= 1` implies that `m` was updated at least once in the loop. Since `m` is set to the current value of `x` whenever `unknown()` returns non-zero, we know that `m` is the maximum value of `x` for which `unknown()` returned non-zero. Therefore, `n <= m` holds after the loop termination. We use implication because if `m < 1`, the assertion is always true.",
