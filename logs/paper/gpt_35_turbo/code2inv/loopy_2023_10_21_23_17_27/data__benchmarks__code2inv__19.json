Therefore, `m <= x` holds before the loop execution.\n- In every iteration of the loop, the value of `x` is increased by `1`. Therefore, `m` is always less than or equal to `x` since it can only be updated inside the loop when the condition `unknown()` is true. Hence, `m <= x` holds in every iteration of the loop.\n- After the loop termination, the condition `m < n` should hold as per the assertion. However, the condition `n > 0` is also present in the program. Therefore, we need to consider two cases:\n    - Case 1: `n <= 0`. In this case, the loop never executes and the assertion is vacuously true since `m < n` holds for all `m` and `n` where `n <= 0`.\n    - Case 2: `n > 0`. In this case, the loop executes at least once. Since `x` starts from `0` and increases by `1` in every iteration of the loop, we have `x <= n`. Therefore, we can conclude that `m <= x <= n`. Combining this with the condition `m <= n` in the assertion, we get `m <= n ==> m < n`.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants that help Frama-C verify the post-condition are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant m <= x;\n    loop invariant m <= n ==> m < n;\n*/\n```",
