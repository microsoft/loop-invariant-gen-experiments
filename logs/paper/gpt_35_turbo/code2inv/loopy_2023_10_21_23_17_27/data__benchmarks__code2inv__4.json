Therefore, z >= y is a loop invariant.\n\n- In every iteration of the loop:\n    - Since x starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 in each iteration, it is always less than or equal to 500.\n    - The relation between z and y may change in each iteration, depending on the condition in the loop body. Therefore, we need to consider two cases:\n        - If z >= y, then y' = y and z' >= y. This means that the relation between z and y is maintained or strengthened.\n        - If z < y, then y' = y and z' <= y. This means that the relation between z and y is weakened or maintained.\n    - Combining these two cases, we get the loop invariant: z >= y ==> z' >= y' && z < y ==> z' <= y\n\n- After the loop termination:\n    - The assertion states that z must be greater than or equal to y. Since z >= y is a loop invariant, it holds true after the loop termination.",
