It is also true in every iteration of the loop because if `m` is less than `a`, `m` is updated to the value of `a`.

Therefore, `k` will always be greater than or equal to 0 after the loop terminates.\n- `j = 0` is true before the loop starts because `j` is assigned the value 0. It is also true in every iteration of the loop because `j` is not modified inside the loop.\n- `k <= 1` is true before the loop starts because `k` is assigned the value 0 and 0 is less than 1.

Therefore, `k` will always be less than or equal to 1 after the loop terminates.\n\nUsing implication, the assertion `a <= m` can be written as `(k >= 1) ==> (a <= m)`. This is because the assertion is guarded by the loop condition `k < 1`, which is the same as `!(k >= 1)`. Therefore, if `k >= 1`, the loop has terminated and the assertion must hold. \n\nSince there are no bounds on the variables `a`, `m`, `j`, and `k`, we cannot add any additional conjunctions to the loop invariants.",

Otherwise, `k` must be 0, and `m` must be at least as large as `a` after the loop terminates. So, we can write the invariant: `(k >= 1 ==> a <= m) && (k == 0 ==> a <= m)`.\n\nFinally, let's put all the loop invariants together in one code block:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant m >= a;\n    loop invariant m >= \\old(m);\n    loop invariant (k >= 1 ==> a <= m) && (k == 0 ==> a <= m);\n*/\n```",

The post-condition is `a <= m`. We can use implication to show that the loop invariants imply the post-condition:\n- `a >= a_old` and `m >= a` imply `m >= a_old`.\n- Since the loop condition is `k < 1`, we know that `k <= 0` when the loop terminates.\n- Since `m >= a_old` and the loop only executes once (when `k` is 0), we know that `m` is the maximum of `m` and `a_old`. Therefore, `m >= a_old` and `a <= a_old` imply `a <= m`.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants we found are sufficient to verify the post-condition.",

Therefore, `m` will always be greater than or equal to `a` after the loop terminates.\n- `k >= 0` is true before the loop starts because `k` is assigned the value 0.

Therefore, `k` will always be greater than or equal to 0 after the loop terminates.\n- `j = 0` is true before the loop starts because `j` is assigned the value 0.
