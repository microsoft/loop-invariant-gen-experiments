Therefore, `1 <= i <= 9` is true. Also, `sn` is incremented by `1` in every iteration, so `sn` is at least `0` and at most `i-1`. Therefore, `0 <= sn <= i-1` is true.\n- After the loop termination, if `sn != 8`, then the loop must have terminated early and `sn` must be equal to `0`. Therefore, `(sn == 0)` is true.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, it can take a maximum value of 9. \n- `sn >= 0`: Since `sn` is initially assigned the value 0 and incremented by at least 1 in each iteration of the loop, `sn` must always be greater than or equal to 0.\n- `sn <= i-1`: Since `sn` is incremented once in each iteration and `i` is incremented at the end of the loop body, `sn` must always be less than or equal to `i-1`.\n- `(i <= 9) ==> (sn + 8 - i >= 0)`: This invariant states that if `i` is less than or equal to 9, then the sum of `sn` and `8-i` must be greater than or equal to 0. This is true because `sn` is initially 0 and incremented by at least 1 in each iteration, while `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration and can take a maximum value of 9. Therefore, the sum of `sn` and `8-i` is always non-negative.\n- `(i > 9) ==> (sn == 8)`: This invariant states that if `i` is greater than 9, then `sn` must be equal to 8. This is true because once `i` becomes greater than 9, the loop condition is no longer satisfied, and `sn` would have been incremented exactly 8 times. \n- `(sn != 8) ==> (i > 9) ==> (\\false)`: This invariant states that if `sn` is not equal to 8, then `i` must be greater than 9.

It starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration of the loop until it reaches 9, which is the maximum value that `i` can take.\n- The second loop invariant bounds the values that `sn` can take. Since `sn` starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, its maximum value is `i-1`. Its minimum value is 0.\n- The third loop invariant states that `sn` is equal to `i-1` in every iteration of the loop. This is because `sn` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, and `i` is also incremented by 1. Therefore, `sn` is always one less than `i`.\n- The last loop invariant is the post-condition of the program, which states that if `sn` is not equal to 8, then it must be equal to 0. This can be expressed as an implication: if `sn` is not equal to 8, then `sn` must be less than 8, which means that `sn` must be less than or equal to `i-1`. Therefore, `sn` must be equal to 0, which is the minimum value that `sn` can take.",
