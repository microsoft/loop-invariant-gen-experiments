This is because if `(i > x) && (y == 1)` then the loop must have executed at least once, and we know from the loop invariants that `j` is the sum of `y` repeated `i-1` times, so `j` equals the sum of the first `i-1` positive integers. This sum is given by `i*(i-1)/2`, so `j` equals `i*(i-1)/2` when `y == 1`. Therefore, if `(i > x) && (y == 1)`, then `i == j` by the assertion. \n\nPutting all the loop invariants together, we get:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i <= x + 1;\n    loop invariant j == (i-1)*y;\n    loop invariant (i <= x + 1) ==> (j == (i-1)*y);\n    loop invariant i <= x + 1;\n    loop invariant (i > x) ==> (y == 1) ==> (i == j);\n*/\n```",

Therefore, at the end of each iteration, `j` must be equal to `(i-1)*y`. We also know that `y` must be equal to 1 for the post-condition to be true, so we add that to the invariant. Additionally, we know that the loop condition is `i <= x`, so `i` must be less than or equal to `x+1` at the end of each iteration.\n- After the loop: We know that `i` must be equal to `j` for the post-condition to be true, and `y` must be equal to 1. Therefore, at the end of the loop, `j` must be equal to `i*y`. Additionally, we know that the loop condition is `i <= x`, so `i` must be greater than `x` or equal to it. If `i` is greater than `x`, then the implication `i > x ==> i == j` is trivially true. If `i` is equal to `x`, then we already know that `i == j` because of the post-condition.",
