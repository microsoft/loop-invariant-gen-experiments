This makes sure that `x` and `y` do not become negative during the loop.\n\nThe fourth invariant states that `y` is always greater than or equal to 0 before and during every iteration of the loop.\n\nFinally, we need to add an implication to take care of the assertion which is guarded by a condition:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant x + y <= n;\n    loop invariant x + y >= 0;\n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n    loop invariant (x == 0) ==> (n == y);\n*/\n```\nThis invariant states that if `x` becomes 0, then `n` must be equal to `y`. This takes care of the post-condition when the loop terminates.\n\nNote: Since all variables are assigned a value before the loop, we do not need to add any implications to handle non-deterministic values.",
                    "Before the loop execution, we have the following pre-conditions:\n- n >= 0\n\nIn the loop body, we have the following assignments:\n- y = y + 1\n- x = x - 1\n\nThe loop condition is x > 0.\n\nAfter the loop termination, we have the following post-condition:\n- n == x + y\n\nLet's start with the loop invariants:\n```\n/*@\nloop invariant 0 <= x <= n;\nloop invariant 0 <= y <= n;\nloop invariant x + y == n;\nloop invariant x >= 0;\n*/\n```\nExplanation of loop invariants:\n- The first loop invariant ensures that x is always between 0 and n.\n- The second loop invariant ensures that y is always between 0 and n.\n- The third loop invariant ensures that x + y is always equal to n, which is the total number of iterations of the loop. This invariant implies the post-condition.\n- The fourth loop invariant ensures that x is always non-negative.\n\nWe need to show that the loop invariants hold:\n- Before the loop execution, we have n >= 0, so 0 <= x <= n, 0 <= y <= n, x + y == n, and x >= 0.\n- In every iteration of the loop, x and y are updated as x = x - 1 and y = y + 1, so x + y does not change. Also, since x > 0 is the loop condition, x is decreased by 1 in every iteration until it reaches 0. Therefore, x will always be between 0 and n, y will always be between 0 and n, and x + y will always be equal to n.\n- After the loop termination, x = 0, which implies that y = n. Therefore, x + y = n, which satisfies the third loop invariant. Since x = 0, the first and fourth loop invariants also hold. The second loop invariant holds because y is always non-negative and y <= n.\n\nFinally, the post-condition is satisfied since n == x + y, which is guaranteed by the third loop invariant."
