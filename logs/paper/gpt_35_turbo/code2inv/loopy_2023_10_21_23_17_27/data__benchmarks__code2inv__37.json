Since the loop only updates `c` when `unknown()` returns a non-zero value and `c` is initially assigned 0, the only way for `c` to be equal to 40 is if the loop runs exactly 40 times and `unknown()` returns a non-zero value every time.

Therefore, when the loop terminates, c is either equal to 40 or less than 40, and all values between 0 and c-1 are not equal to 40.\n- The third loop invariant states that all values of i between c and 39 are equal to 40.

This is because the only postcondition of the program is (c == 40), which we need to show after the loop termination. If the loop terminates because unknown() is false, then the loop invariant \\forall integer i; c <= i < 40 ==> i == 40 ensures that c is equal to 40.\n\nNote: since the loop invariant uses the function unknown(), we cannot prove the postcondition with just loop invariant.

Since the loop only updates `c` when `unknown()` returns a non-zero value and `c` is initially assigned 0, the only way for `c` to be equal to 40 is if the loop runs exactly 40 times and `unknown()` returns a non-zero value every time.

There are no other constraints on `c` before the loop.\n- In every iteration: Since the loop condition depends on the non-deterministic function `unknown()`, we need to consider two cases:\n  - Case 1: `unknown()` returns a non-zero value. In this case, we have two nested conditions:\n    - If `c == 40`, then `c'` is assigned 1. This means that `c' >= 1`.\n    - If `c != 40`, then `c'` is assigned `c + 1`. This means that `c' > c` and `c' <= 40`.\n  - Case 2: `unknown()` returns a zero value. In this case, we have one nested condition:\n    - If `c != 40`, then `c'` is assigned `c`, which means that `c' == c`.\n    - If `c == 40`, then `c'` can take any value between 1 and 40, inclusive, because `c'` is updated to 1 in the next iteration of the loop.\n- After loop termination: The assertion checks if `c` is equal to 40. Since the loop only updates `c` when `unknown()` returns a non-zero value and `c` is initially assigned 0, the only way for `c` to be equal to 40 is if the loop runs exactly 40 times and `unknown()` returns a non-zero value every time.

There are no other constraints on `c` before the loop.\n- In every iteration: Since the loop condition depends on the non-deterministic function `unknown()`, we need to consider two cases:\n  - Case 1: `unknown()` returns a non-zero value. In this case, we have two nested conditions:\n    - If `c == 40`, then `c'` is assigned 1. This means that `c' >= 1`.\n    - If `c != 40`, then `c'` is assigned `c + 1`. This means that `c' > c` and `c' <= 40`.\n  - Case 2: `unknown()` returns a zero value. In this case, we have one nested condition:\n    - If `c != 40`, then `c'` is assigned `c`, which means that `c' == c`.\n    - If `c == 40`, then `c'` can take any value between 1 and 40, inclusive, because `c'` is updated to 1 in the next iteration of the loop.\n- After loop termination: The assertion checks if `c` is equal to 40. Since the loop only updates `c` when `unknown()` returns a non-zero value and `c` is initially assigned 0, the only way for `c` to be equal to 40 is if the loop runs exactly 40 times and `unknown()` returns a non-zero value every time. Therefore, `c` must be equal to 40 after the loop terminates.",
