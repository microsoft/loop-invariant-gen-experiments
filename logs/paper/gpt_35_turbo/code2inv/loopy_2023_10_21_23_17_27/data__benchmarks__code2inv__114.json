This means that any condition inside `assume` must be true for the program to execute further.\n- There are two integer variables `sn` and `x` that are initially assigned the value `0`.\n\nLoop Invariants:\n- Before the loop execution, `sn == 0` and `x == 0`.\n- In every iteration of the loop, `x >= 0` and `sn >= 0`.\n- In every iteration of the loop, `sn == \\sum_{i=1}^{n} 1` where `n` is the number of iterations so far, and `x == \\sum_{i=1}^{n} 1`.\n- After the loop termination, if `sn != x`, then `sn == -1`.\n\nExplanation:\n- Before the loop starts, both `sn` and `x` are assigned the value `0`, which satisfies the initial conditions.\n- In every iteration of the loop, both `sn` and `x` are incremented by `1`, so they must be greater than or equal to `0`.\n- Since the loop condition is non-deterministic, we cannot make any assumptions about the number of iterations. However, we can say that after `n` iterations, `sn` and `x` would have been incremented `n` times. Hence, `sn == \\sum_{i=1}^{n} 1` and `x == \\sum_{i=1}^{n} 1`.\n- After the loop terminates, we check if `sn` is not equal to `x`. If they are not equal, then `sn` must be `-1`. This is because `sn` is incremented once in every iteration of the loop, while `x` is also incremented once in every iteration of the loop. If `sn` is not equal to `x`, then `sn` must have been decremented by `1` after the last iteration, making it equal to `-1`.",
