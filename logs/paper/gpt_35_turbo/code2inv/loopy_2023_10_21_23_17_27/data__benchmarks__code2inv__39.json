This ensures that `c` is always within the range of 1 to n+1.\n- In every iteration of the loop: The loop invariant `0 < c <= n + 1` is still applicable. In addition to this, since `c` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, we can say that for all integers `i` between 1 and `c-1`, `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

Finally, if `c` is equal to `n`, then we need to ensure that all integers between 1 and `n` are present in the set of integers between 1 and `c-1`. This is because if any integer between 1 and `n` is not present in this set, then `c` would have been set to 1 in the previous iteration and the loop would have continued.

Since `n` is greater than 0, the minimum value `c` can take is 0 and the maximum value it can take is `n`. Hence, `c >= 0 && c <= n`.\n- In every iteration: Since `c` is either incremented by 1 or reset to 1, it can never be less than 1 or greater than `n`. Hence, `c >= 1 && c <= n`. Also, since the value of `c` is always bounded by `n`, `c` can never be greater than `n`. Hence, `c <= n`.\n- After the loop: The loop terminates either when the function `unknown()` returns 0 or when `c` becomes equal to `n`. If the loop terminated because `c` became equal to `n`, then the assertion `c <= n` holds. Hence, we can add the assertion as a loop invariant. This implies that after the loop, `c` is less than or equal to `n`. Hence, `c >= 1 && c <= n`. \n\nNote: Since there are no non-deterministic variables in this program, we don't need to use any implications to make the loop invariants trivially true. \n\nTherefore, the loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant c >= 0 && c <= n;\n    loop invariant c >= 1 && c <= n;\n    loop invariant c <= n;\n*/\n```",
