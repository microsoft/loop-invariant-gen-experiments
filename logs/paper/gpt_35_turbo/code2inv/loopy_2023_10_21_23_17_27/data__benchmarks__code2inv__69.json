Therefore, `y` is always non-negative. \n\nFinally, let's consider the variables in the program and add any additional constraints we can derive:\n- `n`: There are no constraints on `n` in the given program.\n- `x`: `1 <= x <= n+1` holds as a loop invariant.\n- `y`: In every iteration of the loop, when `n > 0`, `y >= 0` holds as a loop invariant.\n\nPutting it all together, the loop invariants for the program are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 1 <= x <= n+1;\n    loop invariant (n > 0 ==> y >= 0);\n    loop invariant x == n+1;\n*/\n```",
                    "Pre-conditions:\n- None\n\nVariable assignments:\n- `x = 1`\n\nLoop condition:\n- `x <= n`\n\nLoop body:\n- `y = n - x`\n- `x = x + 1`\n\nPost-conditions:\n- `if (n > 0) { y >= 0; }`\n\nLoop invariants:\n- `x >= 1`\n- `x <= n + 1`\n- `y == n - x + 1 ==> y >= 0`\n\nExplanation:\n- The first loop invariant `x >= 1` holds before the loop executes because `x` is assigned the value 1 before the loop.\n- The second loop invariant `x <= n + 1` holds before the loop executes because `x` is initially 1 and is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. Therefore, it will be less than or equal to `n+1`.\n- The third loop invariant `y == n - x + 1 ==> y >= 0` holds in every iteration of the loop because `y` is assigned the value `n - x` in each iteration and `y` is greater than or equal to 0 if and only if `n - x + 1 >= 0`, which is equivalent to `y == n - x + 1 ==> y >= 0`.\n- The loop invariants imply the post-condition because if `n > 0`, then `x` will be greater than 1 and less than or equal to `n+1` when the loop terminates. Therefore, `y` will be equal to `n - x + 1`, which is less than or equal to 0 if and only if `y < 0`.

Before the loop execution: `n >= 0`\n2. Before the loop execution: `y = n - x`\n3. Before the loop execution: `x >= 1`\n4. In every iteration of the loop: `1 <= x <= n+1`\n5.

After the loop termination: `n > 0 ==> y >= 0`\n\nExplanation:\n1. `n` is an integer variable and we assume that it is non-negative.\n2. `y` is assigned to `n-x` before the loop execution, hence this invariant holds.\n3. `x` is initialized to 1 before the loop execution, hence this invariant holds.\n4. `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, hence `x` is always greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n+1`.\n5. `y` is assigned to `n-x` in each iteration of the loop, hence `y` is always greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to `n`.\n6. The loop terminates when `x` becomes greater than `n`. Since `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop and it starts from 1, it will become equal to `n+1` after the loop termination.\n7. `y` is assigned to `n-x` in each iteration of the loop. When the loop terminates, `x` becomes equal to `n+1`, hence `y` becomes equal to `n-(n+1) = -1` which is outside the range of `y`. Therefore, we add an invariant that asserts that `y` is equal to 0 after the loop termination.\n8. The assertion `y >= 0` is guarded by the condition `n > 0`. Therefore, we add an invariant that implies this condition. If `n` is not greater than 0, then the assertion is trivially true and we don't need to prove it. Therefore, we use implication to make this invariant hold only when `n` is greater than 0.",

After the loop termination: `n > 0 ==> y >= 0`\n\nExplanation:\n1. `n` is an integer variable and we assume that it is non-negative.\n2. `y` is assigned to `n-x` before the loop execution, hence this invariant holds.\n3. `x` is initialized to 1 before the loop execution, hence this invariant holds.\n4. `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, hence `x` is always greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n+1`.\n5. `y` is assigned to `n-x` in each iteration of the loop, hence `y` is always greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to `n`.\n6. The loop terminates when `x` becomes greater than `n`. Since `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop and it starts from 1, it will become equal to `n+1` after the loop termination.\n7. `y` is assigned to `n-x` in each iteration of the loop. When the loop terminates, `x` becomes equal to `n+1`, hence `y` becomes equal to `n-(n+1) = -1` which is outside the range of `y`. Therefore, we add an invariant that asserts that `y` is equal to 0 after the loop termination.\n8. The assertion `y >= 0` is guarded by the condition `n > 0`. Therefore, we add an invariant that implies this condition. If `n` is not greater than 0, then the assertion is trivially true and we don't need to prove it. Therefore, we use implication to make this invariant hold only when `n` is greater than 0.",

After the loop termination: `n > 0 ==> y >= 0`\n\nExplanation:\n1. `n` is an integer variable and we assume that it is non-negative.\n2. `y` is assigned to `n-x` before the loop execution, hence this invariant holds.\n3. `x` is initialized to 1 before the loop execution, hence this invariant holds.\n4. `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, hence `x` is always greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n+1`.\n5. `y` is assigned to `n-x` in each iteration of the loop, hence `y` is always greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to `n`.\n6. The loop terminates when `x` becomes greater than `n`. Since `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop and it starts from 1, it will become equal to `n+1` after the loop termination.\n7. `y` is assigned to `n-x` in each iteration of the loop. When the loop terminates, `x` becomes equal to `n+1`, hence `y` becomes equal to `n-(n+1) = -1` which is outside the range of `y`. Therefore, we add an invariant that asserts that `y` is equal to 0 after the loop termination.\n8. The assertion `y >= 0` is guarded by the condition `n > 0`. Therefore, we add an invariant that implies this condition. If `n` is not greater than 0, then the assertion is trivially true and we don't need to prove it. Therefore, we use implication to make this invariant hold only when `n` is greater than 0.",
