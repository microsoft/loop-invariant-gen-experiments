The second part ensures that if `c` is not equal to its previous value, then `c` must be less than or equal to `n-1`. This is because when `c` is not equal to `n`, it can either increase by 1 or be set to 1. In either case, it cannot exceed `n-1`. \n\nAlso note that we have not made any assumptions about the initial or final value of `c`, as it is non-deterministic. The loop invariants are such that they hold for all possible values of `c`.

We can represent this as a loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant n > 0;\n*/\n```\n\nIn every iteration of the loop, `c` is incremented by 1 or reset to 1 if it reaches `n`. Since we do not know how many times the loop will iterate, we cannot specify an exact value for `c` at any point in the loop. However, we can bound the maximum and minimum values of `c`:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 1 <= c <= n;\n*/\n```\n\nAfter the loop termination, we know that `c` is less than or equal to `n`. If the loop terminates because `unknown()` returns 0, then `c` must be less than or equal to `n` because the loop condition is false. If the loop terminates because an error occurs or the program crashes, then the assertion may or may not hold. Therefore, we can add an implication to the loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 1 <= c <= n ==> c <= n;\n*/\n```\n\nFinally, we need to show that the loop invariants imply the post-condition. The post-condition is `c >= 0`. Since `c` is always positive (because it is incremented by 1 or reset to 1), we can add an implication to the loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 1 <= c <= n ==> c <= n;\n    loop invariant c > 0 ==> c >= 0;\n*/\n```\nNote that we used implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. \n\nTherefore, the complete set of loop invariants for the given program is:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant n > 0;\n    loop invariant 1 <= c <= n;\n    loop invariant 1 <= c <= n ==> c <= n;\n    loop invariant c > 0 ==> c >= 0;\n*/\n```",

Also, `c` cannot exceed `n`, because it is reset to 1 when it reaches `n`.\n- After the loop termination, if `c` is equal to `n`, then it means that the loop terminated after `n` iterations. In this case, we can infer that `c` is non-negative because it was non-negative before the loop execution and it was not decremented during the loop.

So, `c` is always greater than or equal to 1. Also, `c` cannot exceed `n`, because it is reset to 1 when it reaches `n`.\n- After the loop termination, if `c` is equal to `n`, then it means that the loop terminated after `n` iterations. In this case, we can infer that `c` is non-negative because it was non-negative before the loop execution and it was not decremented during the loop.
