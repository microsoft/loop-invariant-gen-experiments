The second invariant is also maintained because `z` is incremented by at most 1 in each iteration, and it is already greater than or equal to `36 * y`.\n- After the loop termination, the loop condition is false, which means that `unknown()` returns 0.

If `z` is less than 0 or greater than or equal to 4608, then the assertion should hold. By the second invariant, `z` is greater than or equal to `36 * y`, and by the third invariant, `z` is less than 4608. Therefore, if `z` is less than 0 or greater than or equal to 4608, then `y` must be less than 0 or greater than or equal to 128, which contradicts the second pre-condition.
