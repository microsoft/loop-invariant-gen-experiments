This is because in each iteration, both x and y are increased by 10, so their sum will always be a multiple of 10.\n- The fourth invariant is derived from the assertion. Since the assertion is guarded by the condition \"if (y == 0)\", we need to take this condition into account in the loop invariant. The invariant states that if y is 0 at the end of the loop, then x cannot be 20. This is because the only way x can be 20 is if it was increased by 10 exactly twice, which would mean that y was also increased by 10 exactly twice, but this is not possible if y is 0.",

This is because in each iteration, both x and y are increased by 10, so their sum will always be a multiple of 10.\n- The fourth invariant is derived from the assertion. Since the assertion is guarded by the condition \"if (y == 0)\", we need to take this condition into account in the loop invariant. The invariant states that if y is 0 at the end of the loop, then x cannot be 20. This is because the only way x can be 20 is if it was increased by 10 exactly twice, which would mean that y was also increased by 10 exactly twice, but this is not possible if y is 0.",
