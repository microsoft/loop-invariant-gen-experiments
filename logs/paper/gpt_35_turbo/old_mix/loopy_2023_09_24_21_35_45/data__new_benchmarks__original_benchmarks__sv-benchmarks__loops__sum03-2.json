We assume that this macro behaves correctly and does not modify any variables.\n- The function `unknown` returns an integer value that is not known at compile-time. We do not make any assumptions about the return value of this function.\n- The function `unknown_uint` returns an unsigned integer value that is not known at compile-time. We do not make any assumptions about the return value of this function.\n- The function `abort` terminates the program with an error message. We assume that this function is correct and does not modify any variables.\n\nVariable assignments:\n- `a` is a constant integer with value 2.\n- `sn` is an unsigned integer initialized to 0.\n- `loop1` and `n1` are unsigned integers initialized to the return values of `unknown_uint`.\n- `x` is an unsigned integer initialized to 0.\n\nLoop condition:\n- The loop condition is `while(1)`, which is an infinite loop.\n\nLoop body:\n- `sn` is incremented by `a`.\n- `x` is incremented by 1.\n- An assertion checks whether `sn` is equal to `x*a` or 0.\n\nTo find the loop invariants, we need to determine what properties are preserved by the loop body and hold before and after the loop. Let's analyze the loop body first:\n\n- `sn` is incremented by `a`. This means that `sn` always increases by `a` in each iteration of the loop.\n- `x` is incremented by 1. This means that `x` always increases by 1 in each iteration of the loop.\n- The assertion checks whether `sn` is equal to `x*a` or 0. This means that either `sn` is a multiple of `a` or `sn` is 0.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can derive the following loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant sn % a == 0 || sn == 0;\n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n*/\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The first loop invariant states that `sn` is always a multiple of `a` or 0. This is because `sn` is incremented by `a` in each iteration of the loop, so it must be a multiple of `a` at some point. Alternatively, if `sn` is initially 0, it will remain 0 throughout the loop.\n- The second loop invariant states that `x` is always non-negative. This is because `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, starting from an initial value of 0.\n\nThe loop invariants hold before the loop execution because `sn` is initially 0 and `x` is initially 0, both satisfying the loop invariants.\n\nThe loop invariants hold in every iteration of the loop because:\n- `sn % a == 0 || sn == 0` holds before the loop body is executed, and `sn` is incremented by `a` in each iteration of the loop, so `sn % a == 0 || sn == 0` continues to hold after the loop body is executed.\n- `x >= 0` holds before the loop body is executed, and `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, so `x >= 0` continues to hold after the loop body is executed.\n\nThe loop invariants hold after the loop termination because the loop condition is an infinite loop, so the loop can only terminate by calling `abort`, which terminates the program. Therefore, the loop invariants continue to hold after the loop termination. \n\nFinally, we need to show that the loop invariants imply the post-condition, which is `sn==x*a || sn == 0`. \n\n- From the loop invariants, we know that `sn % a == 0 || sn == 0`. If `sn == 0`, then `sn==x*a || sn == 0` is true. If `sn % a == 0`, then `sn` is a multiple of `a`, so we can write `sn = ka` for some integer `k`. Then, `x*a = x*2 = 2x = k*a + a = (k+1)*a`, so `sn == x*a` in this case. Therefore, the loop invariants imply the post-condition."
