Since the variables `i` and `j` are initialized before the loop, we can use their initial values as loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i == 1;\n    loop invariant j == 10;\n*/\n```\n\nNow, let's move on to the loop invariants that hold in every iteration of the loop. We can observe that in each iteration, `i` increases by 2 and `j` decreases by 1. Therefore, we can use the following loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i % 2 == 1;  // i is odd\n    loop invariant j + i == 11; // j + i is constant\n*/\n```\n\nNotice that the second loop invariant is derived from the fact that in each iteration, `i` increases by 2 and `j` decreases by 1, so the sum `j + i` is constant throughout the loop.\n\nFinally, let's look at the loop invariants after the loop termination. Since the loop terminates when `j < i`, we can use this fact to derive the following loop invariant:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant j == i - 1 ==> j == 6;\n*/\n```\n\nThis loop invariant states that if `j` is equal to `i - 1`, then `j` must be equal to `6`. This is because the loop terminates when `j < i`, and the only way for `j` to be equal to `i - 1` after the loop is if the loop terminated with `j == 6`.\n\nPutting all of these loop invariants together, we have:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i == 1;\n    loop invariant j == 10;\n\n    loop invariant i % 2 == 1;  // i is odd\n    loop invariant j + i == 11; // j + i is constant\n\n    loop invariant j == i - 1 ==> j == 6;\n*/\n``` \n\nThese loop invariants imply the post-condition assertion `j == 6`, and are therefore sufficient to verify the correctness of the program."

This is true because i is initially assigned the value 1, and in each iteration, i is incremented by 2 and cannot go above 11.\n- The fifth loop invariant states that the difference between j and i is always even.
