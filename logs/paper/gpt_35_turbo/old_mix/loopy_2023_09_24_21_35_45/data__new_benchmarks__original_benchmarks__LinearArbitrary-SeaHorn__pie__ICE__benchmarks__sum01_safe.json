This invariant holds before the loop execution, is preserved in every iteration, and holds after the loop termination.\n- The second loop invariant ensures that sn is always less than or equal to i-1. This invariant holds before the loop execution (since sn is initialized to 0 and i is initialized to 1), is preserved in every iteration (since sn is incremented by 1 in each iteration), and holds after the loop termination.\n- The third loop invariant ensures that sn is always greater than or equal to 0. This invariant holds before the loop execution (since sn is initialized to 0), is preserved in every iteration (since sn is incremented by a non-negative value in each iteration), and holds after the loop termination.\n- The fourth loop invariant ensures that sn is always less than or equal to n. This invariant holds before the loop execution (since sn is initialized to 0 and n is a non-negative integer), is preserved in every iteration (since sn is incremented by a non-negative value in each iteration and n remains constant), and holds after the loop termination.\n- The fifth loop invariant is an implication that ensures that if sn is equal to i-1, then i must be less than or equal to n+1. This invariant holds before the loop execution (since sn is initialized to 0 and i is initialized to 1), is preserved in every iteration (since i is incremented by 1 in each iteration and sn is updated accordingly), and holds after the loop termination (since i is equal to n+1 and sn is equal to n). This invariant helps in verifying the assertion in the program. \n\nFinally, we can use the guard condition in an implication to modify the assertion:\n```\n#define assume(e) if(!(e)) return 0;\nextern int unknown(void);\nextern int unknown_int(void);\n\nint main() { \n  int i, n=unknown_int(), sn=0;\n  for(i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n    sn = sn + 1;\n  }\n  assume(sn == n || sn == 0);\n  //@ assert i > n ==> sn == n;\n  //@ assert i <= n ==> sn == i-1;\n}\n```\n\nNote that we have used an implication to modify the assertion. If i is greater than n, then the loop must have terminated and sn must be equal to n. If i is less than or equal to n, then the loop must not have terminated and sn must be equal to i-1. This modified assertion is implied by the loop invariants we have derived earlier."
