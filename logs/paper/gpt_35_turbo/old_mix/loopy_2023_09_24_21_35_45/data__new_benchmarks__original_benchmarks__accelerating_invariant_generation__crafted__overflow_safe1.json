The loop condition is `x >= 10`, which means that the loop will execute as long as `x` is greater than or equal to 10. The loop body increments `x` by 2. \n\nNow let's think about the pre-conditions and variable assignments in the program. The only variable assignment is `unsigned int x = 10;`. Thus, `x` is initialized to 10 at the beginning of the program.\n\nNext, let's analyze the post-condition `!(x % 2)`, which means that `x` must be even after the loop terminates.\n\nWe can start by adding a loop invariant that is true before the loop execution. Since the loop condition requires `x` to be greater than or equal to 10, we know that `x` is at least 10 when the loop starts. Thus, we can add the following loop invariant:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 10;\n*/\n```\n\nNext, we need to find a loop invariant that is true in every iteration of the loop.

Thus, we can add the following loop invariant:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant !(x % 2);\n*/\n```\n\nFinally, we need to find a loop invariant that is true after the loop termination and implies the post-condition.

Thus, we can add the following loop invariant:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant !(x % 2) ==> !(\\at(x, LoopEntry) % 2);\n*/\n```\n\nNote that we used the implication operator `==>` to take care of the conditional nature of the code. Also, we used the `\\at` operator to refer to the value of `x` at the beginning of the loop (`\\at(x, LoopEntry)`). \n\nPutting everything together, we get the following loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 10;\n    loop invariant !(x % 2);\n    loop invariant !(x % 2) ==> !(\\at(x, LoopEntry) % 2);\n*/\n``` \n\nThese loop invariants are sufficient to help Frama-C verify the post-condition `!(x % 2)` of the program."

Since `x` is assigned the value 10 at the beginning of the program and the loop continues as long as `x` is greater than or equal to 10, we can add the following loop invariant before the loop execution:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 10;\n*/\n```\n\nNow let's find loop invariants that are true in every iteration of the loop. The only statement in the loop body is `x += 2;`. This means that in every iteration of the loop, `x` is incremented by 2. We can use this information to add the following loop invariant:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant (x - 10) % 2 == 0;\n*/\n```\n\nThis loop invariant ensures that `x` is always an even number after the first iteration of the loop. Notice that we use `x - 10` instead of `x` directly, because we want to ignore the initial value of `x`.\n\nFinally, let's find loop invariants that are true after the loop termination. The post-condition of the program is `!(x % 2)`, which means that `x` should be an even number. We can use the loop invariant that we found earlier to show that `x` is indeed an even number. We can add an implication that if `x` is less than 10, then `!(x % 2)` is true:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant (x - 10) % 2 == 0;\n    loop invariant x >= 10;\n    loop assigns x;\n    loop variant x;\n    ensures !(x % 2) ==> x < 10;\n*/\n```\n\nNote that we also added the loop assigns clause to indicate that the loop only modifies `x`. We also added the loop variant clause, which specifies an integer expression that decreases on each iteration of the loop and is strictly positive. In this case, we chose `x` as the variant expression, since `x` is decremented by at least 1 on each iteration of the loop. \n\nTherefore, the final loop invariants are:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant (x - 10) % 2 == 0;\n    loop invariant x >= 10;\n    loop assigns x;\n    loop variant x;\n    ensures !(x % 2) ==> x < 10;\n*/\n```"
