This is true because in every iteration of the loop, either `a` is incremented by 1 and `b` is incremented by 2 or `a` is incremented by 2 and `b` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the sum `a+b` is always incremented by 3 in each iteration.\n- Loop invariant 3: `i <= n ==> 3*(n-i) + a + 2*b == 3*n` ensures that if `i` is less than or equal to `n`, then the sum `a+b` plus `3*(n-i)` is equal to `3*n`. This is true because if `i` is less than `n`, then there are `n-i` iterations left in the loop. In each of these iterations, either `a` is incremented by 2 and `b` is incremented by 1 or `a` is incremented by 1 and `b` is incremented by 2. Therefore, the sum `a+b` is incremented by 3 in each iteration, which is equivalent to `3*(n-i)` over the remaining iterations.\n\nNote that we used implication to handle the conditional nature of the code. Specifically, we used `i <= n ==>` to ensure that the loop invariant holds only when `i` is less than or equal to `n`. \n\nWe did not need to add any additional bounds for the variables `i`, `n`, `a`, and `b` because they are already initialized to valid values. However, we can note that `a` and `b` are always non-negative integers, so we could add `a >= 0` and `b >= 0` as additional loop invariants if desired."
