They also imply the post-condition that `x` is less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, we can add them to the program as follows:\n\n```\n#define assume(e) if(!(e)) return;\n\nvoid main() {\n  int x=0;\n  int n;\n  \n  assume(n > 0 );\n  /*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= x <= n;\n    loop invariant (x < n) ==> x+1 <= n;\n    loop invariant x <= n;\n    loop invariant x <= n ==> x+1 <= n;\n    loop invariant x <= n ==> x <= n;\n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant x >= 0 ==> x <= n;\n    loop invariant x <= n ==> (x < n) || (x >= n);\n  */\n  while( x < n ){\n    x++;\n  }\n  {;\n  //@ assert( x<=n );\n  }\n}\n```"

Also, since `n` is greater than 0, `0 <= n`. Therefore, `0 <= x <= n`.\n- In every iteration of the loop, `x` is incremented by 1, so `x+1 <= n`. However, we need to use implication to handle the conditional nature of the loop. We can say that `x < n` implies `x+1 <= n`, which can be written as `x < n ==> x+1 <= n`. Combining this with the previous loop invariant, we get `0 <= x < n ==> x+1 <= n`. Simplifying this, we get `0 <= x <= n`.\n- After the loop termination, `x` is incremented until it becomes equal to `n` or greater than `n`. Therefore, `x <= n`. \n\nPutting it all together, the loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= x <= n;\n*/\n```"
