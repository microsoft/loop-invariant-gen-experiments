Similarly, `i` is incremented by one in every iteration, so it is strictly increasing.\n- Since the loop condition is `i<100`, `i` is less than or equal to 100 in every iteration of the loop.\n- The sum of the first `i` positive integers is given by the formula `(i * (i+1))/2`, so `c == (i * (i+1))/2` is true before the loop execution (since `i=0` and `c=0`), and remains true in every iteration of the loop (since `c` is updated by adding `i` to its previous value).\n- Finally, after the loop termination, we know that `i >= 100` (since the loop condition failed), so `c >= (100 * 101)/2 = 5050`. Therefore, we can use the guard condition `i>=100 ==> c>=5050` in the assertion."

Hence, `c` is the sum of all the values of `i` seen so far. This is captured by the loop invariant `c == \\sum_{j=0}^{i-1} j`. \n- Since the loop condition is `i<100`, we know that `i` is always less than 100 inside the loop. \n- Also, since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, it remains non-negative (`i>=0`) throughout the loop.\n- The loop invariant `i>0 ==> c>=i-1` captures the fact that if `i` is positive, then `c` is greater than or equal to the sum of numbers from 0 to `i-1`, which is equal to `i-1`. This is because `c` is the sum of all the values of `i` seen so far.\n- After the loop, `i` is equal to 100 and `c` is the sum of numbers from 0 to 99, which is `c == \\sum_{j=0}^{99} j`. \n- Finally, the post-condition `c>=0` is satisfied because `c` is always non-negative (this is ensured by the loop invariant `c>=0`).",
