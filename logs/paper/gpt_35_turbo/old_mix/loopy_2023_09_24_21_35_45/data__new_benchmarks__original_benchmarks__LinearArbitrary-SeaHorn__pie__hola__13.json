Given a program, you can find loop invariants, which can then be used to verify some property in the program. \nFrama-C is a software verification tool for C programs. The input to Frama-C is a C program file with ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations.\nFor the given program, find the necessary loop invariants of the while loop to help Frama-C verify the post-condition.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. \n- Output loop invariants that are true \n(i) before the loop execution, \n(ii) in every iteration of the loop and \n(iii) after the loop termination, \nsuch that the loop invariants imply the post condition.\n- If a loop invariant is a conjunction, split it into its parts.\n- Output all the loop invariants in one code block. For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values. Do not use variables that have garbage values.**\n- **Do not use keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops.**\n- **Variables that are not explicitly initialized, could have garbage values.

The loop condition is the expression `unknown1()`, which is a non-deterministic boolean expression.\n\nTo verify the post-condition, we need to find loop invariants that are true (i) before the loop execution, (ii) in every iteration of the loop, and (iii) after the loop termination, such that the loop invariants imply the post-condition.\n\nBefore the loop execution, we can add the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant j >= 2;\n    loop invariant k >= 0;\n*/\n```\nThese invariants hold since `j` is initialized to `2` and `k` is initialized to `0`.\n\nIn every iteration of the loop, we can add the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant j >= 2;\n    loop invariant k >= 0;\n    loop invariant (flag ==> (j % 4 == 2));\n    loop invariant (!flag ==> (j % 2 == 0));\n*/\n```\nThe first two invariants hold because the variables `j` and `k` are not modified in the loop body. The third invariant holds when `flag` is true, since `j` is incremented by `4` in that case and will always be `2` modulo `4`. The fourth invariant holds when `flag` is false, since `j` is incremented by `2` in that case and will always be `0` modulo `2`.\n\nAfter the loop termination, we can add the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant j == 2*k + 2 ==> k == 0;\n*/\n```\nThis invariant holds since the only modification to `k` is in the else branch, which increments it by `1`. Therefore, `k` will be equal to the number of iterations of the loop taken by the else branch. If `j` is equal to `2*k + 2`, then all the iterations of the loop must have been taken by the else branch, which implies that `k` must be equal to `0`.\n\nFinally, we can use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code and use the guard condition in an implication to make the invariant trivially true at the beginning or end of the loop.

If `flag` is 1, then before the loop execution, `j` must be equal to 4 times the number of iterations `k` plus 2.\n- In every iteration of the loop: `(flag == 0 ==> j == \\old(j) + 2 && k == \\old(k) + 1 && \\forall int i; i >= 0 && i <= k ==> j == 2*i + 2) && (flag == 1 ==> j == \\old(j) + 4 && k == \\old(k) && \\forall int i; i >= 0 && i <= k ==> j == 4*i + 2)`\n    - Explanation:\n        - If `flag` is 0, then in every iteration of the loop, `j` is increased by 2 and `k` is increased by 1. Also, `j` must be equal to 2 times the number of iterations `k` plus 2 for all iterations of the loop.\n        - If `flag` is 1, then in every iteration of the loop, `j` is increased by 4 and `k` remains the same. Also, `j` must be equal to 4 times the number of iterations `k` plus 2 for all iterations of the loop.\n- After the loop termination: `k != 0 ==> j == 2*k+2`\n    - Explanation:\n        - If `k` is not 0 after the loop termination, then the loop must have executed at least once. Therefore, `j` must be equal to 2 times the number of iterations `k` plus 2. This implies the post-condition `j==2*k+2`.\n\nNote:\n- Since the values returned by the `unknown` functions are non-deterministic, we do not need to include them in our loop invariants.",
