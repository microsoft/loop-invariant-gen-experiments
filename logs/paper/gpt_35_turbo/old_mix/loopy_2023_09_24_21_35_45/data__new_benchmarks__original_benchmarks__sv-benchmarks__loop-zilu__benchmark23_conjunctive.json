We cannot make any assumptions about these functions.\n- The program initializes two integer variables `i` and `j` with the return values of `unknown_int()`.

We can do this by analyzing the loop body and making assumptions about the variables.\n\nIn the loop body, `j` is incremented by 2 and `i` is incremented by 1.

The third invariant holds because `j` starts at 0 and increments by 2 in every iteration of the loop until it reaches 200.\n\nFinally, let's find the loop invariant that is true after the loop termination.
