This can be seen by analyzing the loop body: since x is incremented by 2 in each iteration, the parity of x changes. Hence, the invariants involving `x % 2` alternate in each iteration. The other invariants hold trivially since they are either bounds on x or implications involving only old values of x and the loop condition does not depend on any other variable.\n- They imply the post-condition since the only assertion in the program depends only on x and the loop invariant `x % 2 == 1 ==> \\false ==> \\old(x) % 2 == 0` ensures that the assertion holds at the end of the loop."
