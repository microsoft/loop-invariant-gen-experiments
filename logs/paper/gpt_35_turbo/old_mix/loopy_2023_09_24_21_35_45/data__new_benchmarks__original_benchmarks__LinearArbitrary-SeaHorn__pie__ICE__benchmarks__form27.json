Therefore, the loop invariants hold before executing the loop body in every iteration.\n- After executing the loop body, if the condition `0 <= x1p && x1p <= x4p + 1 && x2p == x3p && (x2p <= -1 || x4p <= x2p + 2) && x5p == 0` is true, then the loop invariants hold because `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `x4`, and `x5` are updated to `x1p`, `x2p`, `x3p`, `x4p`, and `x5p`, respectively, and the loop invariants hold for these updated values.\n- After executing the loop body, if the condition `0 <= x1p && x1p <= x4p + 1 && x2p == x3p && (x2p <= -1 || x4p <= x2p + 2) && x5p == 0` is false, then the loop invariants still hold because no variables are modified in this case.\n- After the loop termination, the loop condition `while(input)` is false, so the loop invariants hold for the final values of `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `x4`, and `x5`. These final values satisfy the post-condition because of the implication in the assertion: if the loop invariants hold, then `0 <= x1 && x1 <= x4 + 1` is true, `x2 == x3` is true, `(x2 <="

We also have an `input` variable which is assigned a non-deterministic value using the `unknown_int()` function.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition:\n\n```\nwhile(input)\n{\n  x1p = unknown_int();\n  x2p = unknown_int();\n  x3p = unknown_int();\n  x4p = unknown_int();\n  x5p = unknown_int();\n\n  if (0 <= x1p && x1p <= x4p + 1 && x2p == x3p && (x2p <= -1 || x4p <= x2p + 2) && x5p == 0)\n  {\n    x1 = x1p;\n    x2 = x2p;\n    x3 = x3p;\n    x4 = x4p;\n    x5 = x5p;\n  }\n  input = unknown_int();\n}\n```\n\nThe loop condition is `input`, which means the loop continues as long as `input` is non-zero. Inside the loop, we have five integer variables `x1p`, `x2p`, `x3p`, `x4p`, and `x5p`, which are assigned non-deterministic values using the `unknown_int()` function. We also have an if condition that updates the values of `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `x4`, and `x5` if the condition `0 <= x1p && x1p <= x4p + 1 && x2p == x3p && (x2p <= -1 || x4p <= x2p + 2) && x5p == 0` is satisfied.\n\nNow, let's output the loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@ \n   loop invariant 0 <= input <= 1;\n   loop invariant -1 <= x2 <= x3;\n   loop invariant x3 <= x2 + 1;\n   loop invariant x2 <= x4 + 2 || x2 <= -2;\n   loop invariant 0 <= x5 <= 1;\n   loop invariant 0 <= x1 <= x4 + 1;\n*/\n```\n\nHere are the explanations of each loop invariant:\n\n- `0 <= input <= 1`: This loop invariant ensures that `input` is either 0 or 1, which is necessary for the loop condition to be satisfied.\n- `-1 <= x2 <= x3`: This loop invariant ensures that `x2` is less than or equal to `x3`, which is necessary for the condition `x2p == x3p` in the if statement to be satisfied.\n- `x3 <= x2 + 1`: This loop invariant ensures that `x2` is less than or equal to `x3` and `x3` is at most one greater than `x2`, which is necessary for the condition `x2p == x3p` in the if statement to be satisfied.\n- `x2 <= x4 + 2 || x2 <= -2`: This loop invariant ensures that `x2` is less than or equal to `x4 + 2` or `x2` is less than or equal to `-2`, which is necessary for the condition `(x2p <= -1 || x4p <= x2p + 2)` in the if statement to be satisfied.\n- `0 <= x5 <= 1`: This loop invariant ensures that `x5` is either 0 or 1, which is necessary for the condition `x5p == 0` in the if statement to be satisfied.\n- `0 <= x1 <= x4 + 1`: This loop invariant ensures that `x1` is between 0 and `x4 + 1`, which is necessary for the condition `0 <= x1p && x1p <= x4p + 1` in the if statement to be satisfied.\n\nFinally, we need to ensure that the loop invariants imply the post-condition. Since the assertion is not guarded by any condition, we can directly use the loop invariants to prove the post-condition. Here, the loop invariants ensure that the variables `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `x4`, and `x5` satisfy the condition `0 <= x1 && x1 <= x4 + 1 && x2 =="

                    "content": "First, let's analyze the loop body. The loop body contains an if statement which assigns values to variables x1, x2, x3, x4, and x5. The condition of the if statement has the following conjunction of conditions:\n```\n0 <= x1p \nx1p <= x4p + 1 \nx2p == x3p \n(x2p <= -1 || x4p <= x2p + 2) \nx5p == 0\n```\nWe can use these conditions to form our loop invariants. \n\nNow, let's consider the pre-conditions and variable assignments in the program. The program initializes x1, x2, x3, x4, and x5 to 0. Therefore, we can add the following conjunction as a loop invariant before the loop starts:\n```\nloop invariant 0 <= x1 <= 0\nloop invariant 0 <= x2 <= 0\nloop invariant 0 <= x3 <= 0\nloop invariant 0 <= x4 <= 0\nloop invariant 0 <= x5 <= 0\n```\nSince the program calls an unknown_int function to get input values, we cannot make any assumptions about the input values. Therefore, we cannot add any loop invariant related to the input variable. \n\nNow, let's add loop invariants that hold true in every iteration of the loop. We know that the loop executes only when the input is non-zero. Therefore, we can add the following loop invariant for the input variable:\n```\nloop invariant input != 0 ==> (0 <= x1 <= x4 + 1 && x2 == x3 && (x2 <= -1 || x4 <= x2 + 2) && x5 == 0)\n```\nThis loop invariant ensures that if the input is non-zero, then the conjunction of conditions in the if statement must hold true.\n\nNow, let's consider the assignment statements in the if statement in the loop. We know that the following conditions hold true when the if statement is executed:\n```\n0 <= x1p \nx1p <= x4p + 1 \nx2p == x3p \n(x2p <= -1 || x4p <= x2p + 2) \nx5p == 0\n```\nTherefore, we can add the following loop invariants after the if statement:\n```\nloop invariant x1 == x1p ==> (0 <= x1 <= x4 + 1)\nloop invariant x2 == x2p ==> (x2 == x3 && (x2 <= -1 || x4 <= x2 + 2))\nloop invariant x3 == x3p\nloop invariant x4 == x4p\nloop invariant x5 == x5p\n```\nThese loop invariants ensure that the values of x1, x2, x3, x4, and x5 are updated correctly and satisfy the conditions in the conjunction of the if statement.\n\nFinally, we need to ensure that the post-condition holds true when the loop terminates. Therefore, we can add the following loop invariant after the loop:\n```\nloop invariant  input == 0 ==> (0 <= x1 <= x4 + 1 && x2 == x3 && (x2 <= -1 || x4 <= x2 + 2) && x5 == 0)\n```\nThis loop invariant ensures that the post-condition holds true after the loop terminates.\n\nPutting all the loop invariants together, we get:\n```\nloop invariant 0 <= x1 <= 0\nloop invariant 0 <= x2 <= 0\nloop invariant 0 <= x3 <= 0\nloop invariant 0 <= x4 <= 0\nloop invariant 0 <= x5 <= 0\nloop invariant input != 0 ==> (0 <= x1 <= x4 + 1 && x2 == x3 && (x2 <= -1 || x4 <= x2 + 2) && x5 == 0)\nloop invariant x1 == x1p ==> (0 <= x1 <= x4 + 1)\nloop invariant x2 == x2p ==> (x2 == x3 && (x2 <= -1 || x4 <= x2 + 2))\nloop invariant x3 == x3p\nloop invariant x4 == x4p\nloop invariant x5 == x5p\nloop invariant input == 0 ==> (0 <= x1 <= x4 + 1 && x2 == x3 && (x2 <= -1 || x4 <= x2 + 2) && x5 == 0)\n```\n\nThese loop invariants ensure that the program satisfies the post-condition."
