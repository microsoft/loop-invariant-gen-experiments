This is because if `i` is less than or equal to 3, `sn` is equal to `i*a`. If `i` is 4, then `sn` is assigned the value -10. If `i` is greater than 4, then `sn` is equal to the sum of the first 4 terms of the sequence, which is 8 - 10 + 12 - 14 + ... = 2*(1+2-3+4-...) = 2*(-1)^n*n, where n is the number of terms. This sequence alternates between positive and negative values and hence, `sn` can never be equal to a non-zero multiple of `a` in this case. The loop invariant also bounds the value of `i` between 1 and `n+1`, since `i` starts at 1 and increases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n+1`, after which the loop terminates.\n- The third loop invariant states that after the loop terminates, `sn` is either equal to `n*a` or 0. This is because if the loop terminates normally, `sn` is equal to `n*a`, since it is the sum of the first `n` terms of the sequence, each of which is equal to `a`. If the loop terminates due to the condition `i <= n` being false, then `sn` is equal to 0, since it was not updated in the last iteration of the loop. \n\nNote: Since all the variables in the program have garbage values, we cannot derive any bounds on their values.
