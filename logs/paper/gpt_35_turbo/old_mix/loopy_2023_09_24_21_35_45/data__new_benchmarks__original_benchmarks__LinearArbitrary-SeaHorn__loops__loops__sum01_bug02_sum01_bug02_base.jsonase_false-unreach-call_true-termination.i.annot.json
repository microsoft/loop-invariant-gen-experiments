Thus, we need to add a new loop invariant that takes care of this condition. We can use implication to handle the conditional nature of the code.

It is true because `i` is initialized to 1 and incremented by 1 in every iteration of the loop until `i>n`.\n- The third loop invariant ensures that `sn` is always less than or equal to `2*i`. It is true because in every iteration, `sn` is updated to `sn+2`, which is always less than or equal to `2*i`.\n- The fourth loop invariant ensures that `sn` is always greater than or equal to `-10`. It is true because in the fourth iteration, `sn` is set to `-10`, and subsequently, it can never be less than `-10`.\n- The fifth loop invariant ensures that if `i<=n`, then `sn` is less than or equal to `2*n`. It is true because once `i` exceeds `n`, the loop terminates and the invariant is no longer relevant.\n- The last loop invariant is the post-condition that we want to verify. It ensures that `sn` is either equal to `n*2` or `0` after the loop terminates. It is true because `sn` is incremented by `2` in every iteration of the loop, except when `i` is `4`, in which case `sn` is set to `-10`. If `n` is even, then `sn` will be equal to `n*2` after the loop terminates. If `n` is odd, then `sn` will be equal to `0` after the loop terminates. This can be verified by plugging in some sample values of `n` and manually computing the value of `sn` at the end of the loop."
