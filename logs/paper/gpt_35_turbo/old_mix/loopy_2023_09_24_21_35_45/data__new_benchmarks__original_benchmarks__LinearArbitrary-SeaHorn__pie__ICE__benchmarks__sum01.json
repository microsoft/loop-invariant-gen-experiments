This is true before the loop because `i` is initialized to 1, and in every iteration of the loop, `i` is incremented by 1 until it reaches `n+1`.\n- The second invariant states that `sn` is always equal to `(i-1)*a`. This is true before the loop because `sn` is initialized to 0, and in every iteration of the loop, `sn` is updated by adding `a` to its previous value. Therefore, at the end of the `i`-th iteration, `sn` is equal to `a + 2a + ... + (i-1)a = (i-1)*a`. \n- The third invariant states that if `i` is less than or equal to `n`, then `sn` is less than `n*a`. This is true in every iteration of the loop because `i` is less than or equal to `n`, and `sn` is always equal to `(i-1)*a` which is less than `n*a`.\n\nPost-condition:\n- `sn == n * a || sn == 0`\n\nTo verify the post-condition, we can use the third invariant and the implication operator. Since the loop terminates when `i` becomes greater than `n`, we know that the loop invariant `i <= n+1` is false, which implies that `i == n+2`. Therefore, we can rewrite the post-condition as `(n+1 <= n) ==> (sn == n*a || sn == 0)`, which is equivalent to `0 ==> (sn == n*a || sn == 0)` and hence always true. Therefore, the loop invariants imply the post-condition. \n\nPutting it all together, the loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 1 <= i <= n + 1;\n    loop invariant sn == (i - 1) * a;\n    loop invariant (i <= n) ==> (sn < n * a);\n*/\n```"
