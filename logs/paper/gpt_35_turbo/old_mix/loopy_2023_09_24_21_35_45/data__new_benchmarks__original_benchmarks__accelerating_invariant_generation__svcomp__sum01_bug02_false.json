The length of this initial segment is `j-i+1`. Therefore, `sn` should be equal to `(j-i+1)*a`. Hence, `(i <= j) ==> (sn == (j-i+1)*a)`.\n- After the loop termination, `sn` should be equal to `n*a` if the loop has computed the entire arithmetic sequence, or 0 if the loop has computed only an initial segment of the arithmetic sequence.

Otherwise, `sn` is updated by adding `a`, so `sn = i*a = (i-1)*a + a`.\n- After the loop, `sn` is either `n*a` or 0, since the loop terminates when `i` becomes greater than `n`.

Therefore, `sn >= 0` and `n >= 0`.\n- Also, `i` is initialized to 1 and `j` is initialized to 10. Therefore, `i == 1` and `j == 10`.\n- In every iteration of the loop, `i` starts at 1 and increases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n`. Similarly, `j` starts at 10 and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 1. Therefore, `(i <= n) && (j >= 1)`.\n- If `i` is greater than `j`, then the loop has already computed the sum of the first `i-1` terms of the arithmetic sequence with common difference `a` starting from `a`. Therefore, `sn` should be equal to `(i-1)*a`. Hence, `(i > j) ==> (sn == (i-1)*a)`.\n- If `i` is less than or equal to `j`, then the loop has not yet computed the sum of the first `i-1` terms of the arithmetic sequence, but it has computed the sum of an initial segment of the arithmetic sequence with common difference `a` starting from `a`. The length of this initial segment is `j-i+1`. Therefore, `sn` should be equal to `(j-i+1)*a`. Hence, `(i <= j) ==> (sn == (j-i+1)*a)`.\n- After the loop termination, `sn` should be equal to `n*a` if the loop has computed the entire arithmetic sequence, or 0 if the loop has computed only an initial segment of the arithmetic sequence.

Therefore, after `n` iterations, `sn` is equal to `a` times the number of times `i<j`, which is equivalent to `a` times the number of times `j>1`. \n- In every iteration of the loop, `j` is greater than or equal to 1 because it is initialized to 10 and decremented by 1 in every iteration. \n- After the loop terminates, either `sn` is equal to `n*a` or `sn` is equal to 0.
