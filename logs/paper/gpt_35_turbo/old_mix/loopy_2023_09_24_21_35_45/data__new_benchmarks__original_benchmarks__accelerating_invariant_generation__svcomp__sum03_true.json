The expression `sn == x * a || sn == 0` ensures that `sn` is either a multiple of `a` or 0. This is because `sn` is incremented by `a` in each iteration, and the assertion requires that `sn` is equal to `x * a` at some point. Therefore, the only way for `sn` to be 0 is if `x` is also 0. Otherwise, `sn` must be a multiple of `a` to satisfy the assertion.\n- After the loop termination, `sn` must be equal to `x * a` to satisfy the assertion.\n\nPutting all the loop invariants together, we get:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant sn == 0;\n    loop invariant x == 0;\n    loop invariant sn >= 0;\n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant sn == x * a || sn == 0;\n    loop invariant \\forall integer i; 0 <= i < x ==> sn == i * a;\n    loop invariant sn == x * a;\n*/\n``` \nWe also added an invariant stating that for all integer values of `i` between 0 and `x-1`, `sn` should be equal to `i * a`. This is because `sn` is incremented by `a` in each iteration, and this invariant ensures that `sn` is always a multiple of `a` up to the current value of `x`. This is a stronger invariant than the previous one, and it implies the previous one."
