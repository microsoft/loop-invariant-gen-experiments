Instead, we can use a general bound to show that x is always increasing:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= x <= 0x0fffffff; \n    loop invariant \\forall unsigned int i; (i >= 0 && i < x) ==> (i < 0x0fffffff);\n*/\n```\nThe first invariant shows that x is always within the range [0, 0x0fffffff], which is the range of unsigned integers that can be represented with 28 bits. This invariant ensures that x does not overflow or underflow during the loop execution.\n\nThe second invariant shows that for all unsigned integers i that are greater than or equal to 0 and less than x, i must be less than 0x0fffffff. This invariant ensures that x is always increasing during the loop execution.\n\n- Since the assertion is not guarded by any condition, we can directly use it as the post-condition of the loop:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= x <= 0x0fffffff; \n    loop invariant \\forall unsigned int i; (i >= 0 && i < x) ==> (i < 0x0fffffff);\n    loop invariant x >= 0x0fffffff ==> x > 0x0fffffff;\n*/\n```\nThe third invariant shows that if x is greater than or equal to 0x0fffffff, then it must be greater than 0x0fffffff. This invariant ensures that the assertion holds true after the loop termination.\n\n- There are no non-deterministic variables in this program, so we do not need to use any implications to make the invariants trivially true. \n\nTherefore, the final loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= x <= 0x0fffffff; \n    loop invariant \\forall unsigned int i; (i >= 0 && i < x) ==> (i < 0x0fffffff);\n    loop invariant x >= 0x0fffffff ==> x > 0x0fffffff;\n*/\n```"

Therefore, we can add the following loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x <= 0x0fffffff;\n*/\n```\n- We need to prove that after the loop terminates, x is greater than 0x0fffffff. Therefore, we add the following loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0x0fffffff ==> \\at(x, LoopEntry);\n*/\n```\n- Since x is initialized to a garbage value, we cannot assume any specific value for x before the loop starts.

This is true because the loop condition is x < 0x0fffffff and the loop body increments x by 1 in each iteration.\n- After the loop termination: x == 0x0fffffff + 1. This is true because the loop condition is x < 0x0fffffff, so the loop terminates when x becomes equal to or greater than 0x0fffffff.
