            "ERROR: Output does not contain at least 1 code block\nOutput:\nFirst, let's note the pre-conditions and variable assignments in the program:\n\n- The program defines a macro `assume(e)` that returns 0 if the expression `e` is false.\n- The program defines an integer variable `__BLAST_NONDET`.\n- The `main()` function initializes several integer variables: `MAXPATHLEN`, `pathbuf_off`, `bound_off`, `glob2_p_off`, `glob2_pathbuf_off`, and `glob2_pathlim_off`. The values of these variables are not provided in the program, so we cannot assume anything about their initial values.\n\nNext, let's analyze the loop body and make note of the loop condition:\n\n- The loop iterates over `glob2_p_off` from `glob2_pathbuf_off` to `glob2_pathlim_off`, inclusive.\n\nNow, let's output the necessary loop invariants:\n\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= glob2_p_off <= MAXPATHLEN;\n*/\n/*\nExplanation:\n- The loop invariant ensures that `glob2_p_off` is always within the bounds of `0` and `MAXPATHLEN`, inclusive.\n- Since `glob2_pathbuf_off` is initialized to `pathbuf_off`, which is initialized to `0`, and `glob2_pathlim_off` is initialized to `bound_off`, which is initialized to `MAXPATHLEN`, we can use these values to bound `glob2_p_off`.\n- Note that we do not assume anything about the values of `MAXPATHLEN`, `pathbuf_off`, `bound_off`, `glob2_pathbuf_off`, or `glob2_pathlim_off`, other than that `MAXPATHLEN` is greater than `0`. Therefore, we need to add the condition `MAXPATHLEN > 0` to the program to ensure that these variables are initialized to valid values.\n*/\n\n/*@ \n    loop invariant pathbuf_off == 0;\n    loop invariant bound_off == pathbuf_off + MAXPATHLEN;\n    loop invariant glob2_pathbuf_off == pathbuf_off;\n    loop invariant glob2_pathlim_off == bound_off;\n*/\n/*\nExplanation:\n- These loop invariants ensure that the variables `pathbuf_off`, `bound_off`, `glob2_pathbuf_off`, and `glob2_pathlim_off` are initialized to their expected values and are not modified during the loop.\n- The loop invariant `pathbuf_off == 0` ensures that `pathbuf_off` is initialized to `0`.\n- The loop invariant `bound_off == pathbuf_off + MAXPATHLEN` ensures that `bound_off` is initialized to `MAXPATHLEN`.\n- The loop invariants `glob2_pathbuf_off == pathbuf_off` and `glob2_pathlim_off == bound_off` ensure that `glob2_pathbuf_off` and `glob2_pathlim_off` are initialized to the same values as `pathbuf_off` and `bound_off`, respectively.\n*/\n\n/*@ \n    loop invariant (__BLAST_NONDET == 0) ==> \\forall integer i; glob2_pathbuf_off <= i <= glob2_p_off ==> \\false;\n*/\n/*\nExplanation:\n- The loop invariant ensures that if the variable `__BLAST_NONDET` is equal to `0`, then there are no values of `i` between `glob2_pathbuf_off` and `glob2_p_off` (inclusive) that satisfy some arbitrary condition.\n- Since we do not know anything about the initial value of `__BLAST_NONDET`, we need to use an implication to make the invariant true for all possible values of `__BLAST_NONDET`.\n- Note that we do not use the \\at(x, Pre) notation for any variable, as instructed.\n*/\n\n/*@ \n    loop invariant (__BLAST_NONDET == 0) ==> \\forall integer i; glob2_p_off < i <= glob2_pathlim_off ==> \\false;\n*/\n/*\nExplanation:\n- This loop invariant is similar to the previous one, but it ensures that if the variable `__BLAST_NONDET` is equal to `0`, then there are no values of `i` between `glob2_p_off + 1` and `glob2_pathlim_off` (inclusive) that satisfy some arbitrary condition.\n- Again, we use an implication to make the invariant true for all possible values of `__BLAST_NONDET`.\n*/\n\n/*@ \n    loop invariant (__BLAST_NONDET != 0) ==> \\true;\n*/\n/*\nExplanation:\n- This loop invariant is trivially true if `__BLAST_NONDET` is not equal to `0`.\n- We use an implication to make the invariant true for all possible values of `__BLAST_NONDET`.\n*/\n\nPutting it all together, the loop invariants for the loop in the program are:\n\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= glob2_p_off <= MAXPATHLEN;\n\n    loop invariant pathbuf_off == 0;\n",
