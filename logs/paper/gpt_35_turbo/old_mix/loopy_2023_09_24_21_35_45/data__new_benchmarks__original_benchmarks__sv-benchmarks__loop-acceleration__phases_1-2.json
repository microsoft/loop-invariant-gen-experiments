This ensures that the evenness of `x` is maintained throughout the loop.\n- `(x < 0xfff1) ==> (x % 2 == 0);`: This means that if `x` is less than 0xfff1, it must be even, since it is incremented by 1 in this branch.\n- `(x >= 0xfff1) ==> (x % 2 == 0);`: This means that if `x` is greater than or equal to 0xfff1, it must be even, since it is incremented by 2 in this branch.\n- `((x % 2 == 0) && (x < 0xfff1)) ==> (x == \\at(x, Loop_Entry) + \\floor((\\at(x, Loop_Entry) - 0xfff1) / 2) * 2);`: This ensures that `x` is incremented by 1 when it is less than 0xfff1 and maintains evenness.

If `x` is less than or equal to `0xfff1`, then `x` is incremented by 1, which means that it becomes even. So, we add `x % 2 == 0` as a loop invariant when `x` is less than or equal to `0xfff1`. If `x` is greater than `0xfff1`, then `x` is incremented by 2, which means that `x-1` becomes even. So, we add `(x-1) % 2 == 0` as a loop invariant when `x` is greater than `0xfff1`. We also add `x >= 0` and `(x-1) >= 0` as loop invariants to ensure that `x` and `x-1` are non-negative inside the loop.\n- After the loop termination, `x` is even, which is the post-condition.",
            "ERROR: Output does not contain at least 1 code block\nOutput:\nPre-conditions:\n- None\n\nVariable Assignments:\n- x = 0\n\nLoop Condition:\n- x < 0x0fffffff\n\nLoop Invariants:\n- Before the loop execution: None\n- In every iteration of the loop:\n    - x <= 0x0fffffff\n    - x >= 0\n    - (x < 0xfff1) ==> (x' == x + 1)\n    - (x >= 0xfff1) ==> (x' == x + 2)\n- After the loop termination:\n    - x >= 0xfff1 ==> (x % 2 == 0)\n\nExplanation:\n- The first two invariants ensure that x stays within the allowed bounds throughout the loop execution.\n- The third and fourth invariants are implications that use the loop condition to split the loop body into two cases. In the first case, x is incremented by 1, and in the second case, x is incremented by 2. These invariants ensure that the loop body is executed correctly for both cases.\n- The last invariant is an implication that uses the loop condition to ensure that x is even after the loop termination if x is greater than or equal to 0xfff1. This guarantees that the assertion is true after the loop termination. \n\nNote: Since x is initialized to 0 and incremented by either 1 or 2 in each iteration, it is always even when it is greater than or equal to 0xfff1. Therefore, the last invariant is true for all possible values of x after the loop termination.",
