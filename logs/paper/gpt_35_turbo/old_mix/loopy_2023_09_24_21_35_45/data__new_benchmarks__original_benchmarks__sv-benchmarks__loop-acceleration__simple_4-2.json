Since the loop condition is `x > 0`, and `x` is decreased by `2` in each iteration, `x` will eventually become less than or equal to `0`. At this point, the value of `x` is even, since it was either even to begin with or became even during the loop. Hence, the loop invariant holds.\n\nLoop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x % 2 == 0;\n*/\n```"
