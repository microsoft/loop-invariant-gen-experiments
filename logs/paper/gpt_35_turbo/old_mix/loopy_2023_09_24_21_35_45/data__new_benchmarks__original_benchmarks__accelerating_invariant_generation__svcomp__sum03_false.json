Also, since `a` is always 2, the sum `sn` will either be equal to `(x-1) * a` or 0. This is because, if `x` is less than 10, `sn` is incremented by `a`. Otherwise, `sn` remains the same. Also, since the loop runs until `x` is less than or equal to 10, `x` will always be less than or equal to 11.\n- After the loop termination, `sn` will be equal to the sum of `a` (which is 2) added to itself 10 times, which is equal to 20. Alternatively, `sn` could be equal to 0 if the loop never executed or if `x` was less than 10 at all times. Therefore, the postcondition `sn==20 || sn == 0` holds."

The second invariant states that for all `i` less than `x`, the product of `i` and `a` is less than or equal to `sn`. This is because we know that `sn` is equal to the sum of the products of `a` and the loop index `i`, up to `x-1`. The third invariant states that for all `i` greater than or equal to `x`, `sn` is either equal to the product of `i` and `a`, or it is equal to 0. This is because we know that `sn` will be updated to the sum of the products of `a` and the loop index `i`, up to some value less than `loop1`, and after that, it will remain constant at `x*a` if `x<10` or it will remain constant at its previous value if `x>=10`.\n\n3. After the loop termination, the following loop invariants hold:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant sn == x*a || sn == 0;\n*/\n```\nThis invariant states that after the loop has terminated, `sn` is either equal to the product of `x` and `a`, or it is equal to 0. This is because the only way `sn` can be updated is through the addition of `a` to itself `x` times, up to `x-1` if `x<10`, and after that, it will remain constant at `x*a` if `x<10` or it will remain constant at its previous value if `x>=10`. Therefore, `sn` will be equal to `x*a` if `x<10`, and it will be equal to its previous value if `x>=10`."
