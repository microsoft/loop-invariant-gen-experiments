Hence, the first invariant doesn't hold true before the loop execution. \n    - Since `i` starts at 0, the first invariant can be rephrased as: `i >= 0` which is true. \n    - `i` is even is not true before the loop execution as `i` is not initialized yet.\n    - `i != LARGE_INT` is trivially true before the loop execution as `i` is not initialized and hence cannot be equal to `LARGE_INT`.\n- In every iteration of the loop:\n    - Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 2 in every iteration, the first invariant (`0 <= i <= LARGE_INT`) holds true in every iteration of the loop.\n    - `i` is even is true in every iteration of the loop since it is incremented by 2 in every iteration.\n    - `i != LARGE_INT` holds true in every iteration of the loop since the loop condition is `i < LARGE_INT` and not `i <= LARGE_INT`.\n- After the loop termination:\n    - Since the loop condition is `i < LARGE_INT` and `i` increments by 2 in every iteration, the loop terminates when `i` becomes equal to `LARGE_INT` or `i` becomes greater than `LARGE_INT`. Since `i` is even and `LARGE_INT` is even, `i` cannot become greater than `LARGE_INT`. Hence, the first invariant (`0 <= i <= LARGE_INT`) implies the post-condition (`i == LARGE_INT`). \n    - Since `i` is even and `LARGE_INT` is even, `i` cannot be equal to `LARGE_INT` in the post-condition. Hence, we need to use the implication of the form `(i == LARGE_INT) ==> false` in the post-condition to satisfy the invariant `i != LARGE_INT`.\n\nThus, the necessary loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= i <= LARGE_INT;\n    loop invariant i % 2 == 0;\n*/\n```\nAnd the final post-condition with the implication is:\n```\n{;\n    //@ assert (i == LARGE_INT) ==> false;\n    //@ assert i == LARGE_INT;\n}\n```"
