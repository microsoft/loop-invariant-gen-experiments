Thus, `y` is greater than or equal to `t`.\n\nTherefore, the final loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant t == y && i == 0;\n    loop invariant x <= 0 ==> y == \\old(y);\n    loop invariant x > 0 ==> y >= \\at(y, LoopEntry) + x;\n    loop invariant t <= y;\n    loop invariant !unknown3() ==> t <= y;\n*/\n```"
