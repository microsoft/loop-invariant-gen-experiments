Since they are incremented by the same amount in each iteration of the loop, their difference `i-j` is equal to their initial difference `len-BASE_SZ`.\n- `i-j = len-BASE_SZ` is the relationship between `i`, `j`, `len`, and `BASE_SZ`. This is derived from the fact that `i` and `j` are incremented by the same amount and `len` is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.\n- `len >= 0` ensures that the loop terminates eventually.\n- The loop invariant `0 <= j < BASE_SZ` and `0 <= i < BASE_SZ` imply that `j < BASE_SZ` and `i < BASE_SZ`. Since `len >= 0`, we know that `i-j <= BASE_SZ-1`. Therefore, `len - BASE_SZ <= i-j <= BASE_SZ-1`, which implies that `i-j = len - BASE_SZ`. This is the fourth loop invariant. \n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the given program are:\n```\n/*@\nloop invariant 0 <= BASE_SZ - 1;\nloop invariant 0 <= j < BASE_SZ;\nloop invariant 0 <= i < BASE_SZ;\nloop invariant i - j == len - BASE_SZ;\nloop invariant len >= 0;\n*/\n```"

Therefore, `len >= 0` and `i == j` are true before the loop starts.\n- `0 <= j < BASE_SZ` and `0 <= i < BASE_SZ` are loop invariants before the loop execution because `j` and `i` are initialized to `0` and cannot take negative values. Also, both `i` and `j` are incremented by `1` in every iteration of the loop, and the loop condition ensures that `i` and `j` are always less than `BASE_SZ`.\n- `len >= 0` is a loop invariant in every iteration of the loop because `len` is decremented by `1` in every iteration and cannot take negative values.\n- `i <= BASE_SZ` and `j <= BASE_SZ` are loop invariants in every iteration of the loop because both `i` and `j` are incremented by `1` in every iteration, and their maximum value is `BASE_SZ`.\n- `i == \\old(i) + 1 ==> j == \\old(j) + 1` and `j == \\old(j) + 1 ==> i == \\old(i) + 1` are loop invariants in every iteration of the loop because both `i` and `j` are incremented by `1` in every iteration.

The value of `__BLAST_NONDET` is non-deterministic and could be any integer value.\n- The value of `BASE_SZ` is assumed to be greater than 0. \n\nLoop condition:\n- The loop condition is `while(1)` which means the loop will execute indefinitely, until the `goto END` statement is executed.\n\nLoop invariants:\n- Before the loop: `0 <= len <= BASE_SZ`, `0 <= i <= BASE_SZ`, `0 <= j <= BASE_SZ`.\n- In every iteration of the loop: \n  - `0 <= len <= BASE_SZ`\n  - `0 <= i < BASE_SZ`\n  - `0 <= j < BASE_SZ`\n  - `i - j = j - i` (this can be simplified to `i = j`)\n  - `len + i = BASE_SZ`\n  - `len + j = BASE_SZ`\n  - `__BLAST_NONDET == 0 ==> i <= j`\n  - `__BLAST_NONDET == 1 ==> i == j + 1`\n- After the loop: `len == 0 ==> i == j == BASE_SZ`\n\n\nExplanation:\n- The variable `len` is decremented in each iteration of the loop until it becomes zero. Therefore, `0 <= len <= BASE_SZ` holds before the loop and in every iteration of the loop. \n- `i` and `j` start at 0 and are incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. Therefore, `0 <= i < BASE_SZ` and `0 <= j < BASE_SZ` hold in every iteration of the loop. \n- Since `i` and `j` are incremented by the same value in each iteration, they are always equal. Therefore, `i - j = j - i` holds in every iteration, which simplifies to `i = j`.\n- The sum of `len`, `i`, and `j` is always equal to `BASE_SZ`. Therefore, `len + i = BASE_SZ` and `len + j = BASE_SZ` hold in every iteration of the loop. \n- The condition `__BLAST_NONDET == 0` means that `__BLAST_NONDET` is equal to 0. If `__BLAST_NONDET` is equal to 0, then `i` and `j` are either equal or `i` is less than `j`. Therefore, `__BLAST_NONDET == 0 ==> i <= j` holds in every iteration of the loop.\n- The condition `__BLAST_NONDET == 1` means that `__BLAST_NONDET` is equal to 1. If `__BLAST_NONDET` is equal to 1, then `i` is equal to `j+1`. Therefore, `__BLAST_NONDET == 1 ==> i == j + 1` holds in every iteration of the loop.\n- After the loop terminates, `len` is equal to 0. Therefore, `len == 0 ==> i == j == BASE_SZ` holds.",
