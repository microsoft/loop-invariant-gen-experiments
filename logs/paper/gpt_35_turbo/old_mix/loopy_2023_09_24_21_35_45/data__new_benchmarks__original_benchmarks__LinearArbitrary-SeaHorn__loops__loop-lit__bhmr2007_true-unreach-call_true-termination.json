The post-condition of the program is that the sum of a and b should be equal to 3 times n. We need to find the necessary loop invariants of the while loop to help Frama-C verify the post-condition. \n\nFirst, let's analyze the loop body. The loop body contains two conditional statements that update the values of a and b. In the first case, if the condition in the if statement is true, a is incremented by 1 and b is incremented by 2. In the second case, if the condition in the if statement is false, a is incremented by 2 and b is incremented by 1.\n\nNow, let's find the necessary loop invariants. Since we don't have any information about the unknown conditions that update the values of a and b, we cannot find the exact loop invariants. However, we can make some assumptions about the minimum and maximum values that a and b can take. \n\nBefore the loop execution, we have the following pre-conditions:\n```\nn >= 0 && n <= LARGE_INT\n```\nThis means that n is a non-negative integer less than or equal to LARGE_INT. \n\nWe can also assume that the initial values of a and b are both 0. Therefore, we can add the following loop invariants before the loop execution:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1: a >= 0;\n    loop invariant i2: b >= 0;\n    loop invariant i3: a + b == 0;\n*/\n```\nThe loop invariant i1 states that the value of a is always non-negative. Similarly, the loop invariant i2 states that the value of b is always non-negative. The loop invariant i3 states that the sum of a and b is always equal to 0 before the loop execution. This is true because we assume that the initial values of a and b are both 0. \n\nIn every iteration of the loop, the values of a and b are updated based on some unknown conditions. We don't have any information about the minimum and maximum values that a and b can take after each iteration. Therefore, we cannot find any loop invariants that hold for every iteration of the loop. \n\nAfter the loop termination, we know that the loop executed n times and updated the values of a and b. We also know that the sum of a and b should be equal to 3 times n. Therefore, we can add the following loop invariant after the loop termination:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i4: a + b == 3*i;\n*/\n```\nThe loop invariant i4 states that the sum of a and b is always equal to 3 times i after the loop termination. This is true because the loop executed n times and i is equal to n after the loop termination. \n\nSince we don't have any information about the unknown conditions that update the values of a and b, we cannot find any other loop invariants. Therefore, the final loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1: a >= 0;\n    loop invariant i2: b >= 0;\n    loop invariant i3: a + b == 0;\n    loop invariant i4: a + b == 3*i;\n*/\n```\nNote that the loop invariant i3 is redundant and can be removed."

Also, `a + b` is always less than or equal to `3*n` as `a` and `b` are incremented by 2 in one branch and by 1 in the other branch of the conditional statement inside the loop. Moreover, `a + b` is always greater than or equal to `2*i` as each iteration increments `a` and `b` by at least 1. Hence, `a + b` can take only one of the three values: `2*i`, `3*i`, or `3*n`.\n    - `a` and `b` must be non-negative.\n    - If `a` and `b` are both odd or both even, then the conditional statement inside the loop is executed an even number of times. Hence, `a` and `b` remain either both odd or both even at the end of the loop.\n    - If `a` is less than `b` and `i` is odd, then the conditional statement inside the loop has been executed an odd number of times and `a` has been incremented by `n-i` times with 2 and `b` has been incremented by `n-i` times with 1. Hence, `a + 2*(n-i) <= b`.\n    - If `a` is greater than `b` and `i` is odd, then `b` has been incremented by `n-i` times with 2 and `a` has been incremented by `n-i` times with 1. Hence, `a <= b + 2*(n-i)`.\n    - If `a` is less than `b` and `i` is even, then `b` has been incremented by `n-i` times with 2 and `a` has been incremented by `n-i` times with 1. Hence, `a <= b + 2*(n-i)`.\n    - If `a` is greater than `b` and `i` is even, then `a` has been incremented by `n-i` times with 2 and `b` has been incremented by `n-i` times with 1. Hence, `a + 2*(n-i) <= b`.\n- After the loop termination, `a` and `b` have been incremented according to the conditional statement inside the loop exactly `n` times each. Hence, `a + b == 3*n`."

(Here, we can use the guard condition of the assertion in an implication to get the desired post-condition.) \n\nExplanation:\n- Before the loop execution: \n    - `a` and `b` are initialized to 0.\n    - `i` is initialized to 0.\n    - `n` must satisfy the pre-conditions.\n- In every iteration of the loop:\n    - `i` must be between 0 and `n` (inclusive) as it is incremented by 1 in every iteration.\n    - `a + b` is always even as the sum of an even and odd number is always odd and the sum of two even numbers is always even. Also, `a + b` is always less than or equal to `3*n` as `a` and `b` are incremented by 2 in one branch and by 1 in the other branch of the conditional statement inside the loop. Moreover, `a + b` is always greater than or equal to `2*i` as each iteration increments `a` and `b` by at least 1. Hence, `a + b` can take only one of the three values: `2*i`, `3*i`, or `3*n`.\n    - `a` and `b` must be non-negative.\n    - If `a` and `b` are both odd or both even, then the conditional statement inside the loop is executed an even number of times. Hence, `a` and `b` remain either both odd or both even at the end of the loop.\n    - If `a` is less than `b` and `i` is odd, then the conditional statement inside the loop has been executed an odd number of times and `a` has been incremented by `n-i` times with 2 and `b` has been incremented by `n-i` times with 1. Hence, `a + 2*(n-i) <= b`.\n    - If `a` is greater than `b` and `i` is odd, then `b` has been incremented by `n-i` times with 2 and `a` has been incremented by `n-i` times with 1. Hence, `a <= b + 2*(n-i)`.\n    - If `a` is less than `b` and `i` is even, then `b` has been incremented by `n-i` times with 2 and `a` has been incremented by `n-i` times with 1. Hence, `a <= b + 2*(n-i)`.\n    - If `a` is greater than `b` and `i` is even, then `a` has been incremented by `n-i` times with 2 and `b` has been incremented by `n-i` times with 1. Hence, `a + 2*(n-i) <= b`.\n- After the loop termination, `a` and `b` have been incremented according to the conditional statement inside the loop exactly `n` times each. Hence, `a + b == 3*n`.",

This is because in each iteration of the loop, either `a` increases by 2 and `b` increases by 1 or `a` increases by 1 and `b` increases by 2.

This is because in each iteration of the loop, either `a` increases by 2 and `b` increases by 1 or `a` increases by 1 and `b` increases by 2. So, the difference between `3*i` and `a + b` can decrease by at most 1 in each iteration.\n- The seventh invariant states that if `i` equals `n`, then `a + b` equals `3*n`. This is because the loop has iterated `n` times, and `a` has increased by 2 and `b` has increased by 1 in each iteration, so `a + b` must equal `3*n`.",
