Therefore, the assertion is true.\n- Alternatively, we can use the loop invariant to prove the assertion using implication as follows:\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant x >= 0 && x <= 6;\n  loop invariant y == 2^x;\n  loop assigns x,y;\n*/\nwhile (x < 6) {\n  x++;\n  y *= 2;\n}\n\n{;\n  //@ assert x != 6 ==> x < 6;\n  //@ assert x != 6 ==> y == 2^x;\n}\n```\n- Since x can only take values from 0 to 5 inclusive during the loop execution, if x is not equal to 6, then x must be less than 6. Therefore, the first implication is true.\n- Similarly, if x is not equal to 6, then y must be equal to 2^x. Therefore, the second implication is true."
