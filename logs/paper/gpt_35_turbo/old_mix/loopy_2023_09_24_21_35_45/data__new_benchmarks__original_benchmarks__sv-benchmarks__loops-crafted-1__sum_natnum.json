This expression gives the sum of the first `i-1` natural numbers. Hence, `sum == ((i-1)*i)/2` is true.\n- After the loop termination, `i` has the value `SIZE + 1` because the loop terminates when `i` becomes equal to `SIZE + 1`.

Since `sum` is initialized to 0, `sum` after `i` iterations of the loop is equal to the sum of all numbers from 1 to `i`, which is `((i*(i+1))/2)`. Therefore, the loop invariant for `sum` is `sum == ((i*(i+1))/2)`.\n- Also, `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, and `i` starts from 0 and stops when it reaches `SIZE`. Therefore, the loop invariant for `i` is `0 <= i <= SIZE`.\n- After the loop termination, `i` is equal to `SIZE`, which is the maximum value it can take. Therefore, the loop invariant for `i` is `i == SIZE`.\n- Finally, `sum` should be equal to the sum of all numbers from 1 to `SIZE`, which is `((SIZE*(SIZE+1))/2)`. Therefore, the loop invariant for `sum` is `sum == ((SIZE*(SIZE+1))/2)`.\n\nNote that since `SIZE` is a constant, we do not need to add any additional bounds on its value.

The loop body increments the value of `i` by `1` and adds it to the variable `sum`.\n\nNow, we need to find loop invariants that are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination such that they imply the post-condition:\n\n(i) Before the loop execution, we can state the following loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant sum == 0;\n*/\n```\nThis is true since the loop variable `i` is not yet initialized and so `sum` is `0`.\n\n(ii) In every iteration of the loop, we can state the following loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 1 <= i <= SIZE+1;\n    loop invariant sum == ((i-1)*i)/2;\n*/\n```\nThe first invariant states that `i` is always between `1` and `SIZE+1`. This is true since the loop starts with `i=0` and increments it by `1` in each iteration until `i=SIZE+1`. The second invariant states that `sum` is always equal to `(i-1)*i/2`. This is true since `sum` is initialized to `0` before the loop and in each iteration, `i` is incremented by `1` and added to `sum`, which is equal to the sum of integers from `1` to `i-1`.\n\n(iii) After the loop termination, we can state the following loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant sum == ((SIZE *(SIZE+1))/2);\n*/\n```\nThis is true since after the loop terminates, the value of `sum` is equal to the sum of integers from `1` to `SIZE`, which is `SIZE*(SIZE+1)/2`.\n\nFinally, we need to use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code since the assertion is guarded by a condition. We use the guard condition in an implication as follows:\n```\nwhile(i< SIZE){\n  /* loop invariant */\n  assume(1 <= i <= SIZE+1);\n  assume(sum == ((i-1)*i)/2);\n  \n  /* loop body */\n  i = i + 1;\n  sum += i;\n\n  /* assertion */\n  assume(i >= SIZE);\n  assume(sum == ((SIZE *(SIZE+1))/2));\n}\n```\nHere, we add two assumptions to the loop body. The first assumption `assume(i >= SIZE)` is the negation of the loop condition `i < SIZE`. The second assumption `assume(sum == ((SIZE *(SIZE+1))/2))` is the implication of the guard condition `i >= SIZE` and the post-condition `sum == ((SIZE *(SIZE+1))/2)`. This ensures that the loop invariant holds even when the loop has terminated.\n\nTherefore, the complete loop invariants for the loop in the program above are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant sum == 0; \n    loop invariant 1 <= i <= SIZE+1;\n    loop invariant sum == ((i-1)*i)/2;\n    loop invariant sum == ((SIZE *(SIZE+1))/2);\n*/\n```"
