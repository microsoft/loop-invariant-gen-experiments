Also, note that the loop invariant `x - y == 0` implies that `x` is always equal to the sum of all `y` values encountered so far in the loop.

Therefore, we can add the following loop invariant before the loop execution:\n\n```\n/*@ loop invariant -y <= x; */\n```\n\nFrom the second line, we can deduce that `x` must always be equal to `0`. However, since `x` is assigned a new value in the next line, we can add the following loop invariant after the first line and before the second line:\n\n```\n/*@ loop invariant x == 0; */\n```\n\nFrom the third line, we can deduce that `x` must always be non-zero.

It states that if `x` is non-zero, then it must be equal to the negative sum of all previous values of `y`. This is because, in the loop body, we subtracted the previous value of `y` from `x` and then added the new value of `y` to `x`. Therefore, if `x` is not zero, it must be equal to the negative sum of all previous values of `y`.\n\nFinally, we need to add a loop invariant that holds after the loop termination.

Since `x` is assigned the value of `x-y` in each iteration and `y` is assigned a non-zero value, the product of `x` and `y` is always the same.\n- The third loop invariant `i >= 0` ensures that `i` is always non-negative.\n- The fourth loop invariant `y != 0 ==> x%y == 0` ensures that `x` is divisible by `y` whenever `y` is non-zero. This is required to maintain the relation between `x` and `y`.\n- The fifth loop invariant `\\forall integer k; 0 <= k < i ==> x+k*y == \\at(x, Pre)` ensures that the relation between `x` and `y` is maintained for all previous values of `i`. This is required to ensure that the loop invariant `x == i*y` is maintained in every iteration. \n\nFinally, we add an implication to make the final assertion trivially true:\n```\n{;\n//@ assert x == 0 ==> x==0;\n}\n```\nThis completes the loop invariants for the given program."

This is true for the first iteration, where `i=0`, since both sums are 0. For subsequent iterations, assume that the invariant holds for the previous iteration. Then, `x` is updated to `x-y` and `y` is assigned a new non-zero value. Thus, the difference between `x` and `y` becomes the difference between the previous sum of `y` and the previous sum of `x`, plus the new value of `y`. Therefore, the invariant holds for all iterations.\n    - `x != 0`: This invariant ensures that `x` is always non-zero inside the loop. Initially, `x` is 0, but then it is updated in each iteration. Since `y` is assumed to be non-zero and `x` is updated with non-zero values of `y`, `x` will always be non-zero in subsequent iterations.\n    - `y != 0`: This invariant ensures that `y` is always non-zero inside the loop. `y` is initialized to a non-zero value at the beginning of each iteration, so the invariant holds for all iterations.\n- After loop termination:\n    - `x == 0`: This invariant ensures that `x` is 0 after the loop terminates. From the previous invariant, we know that `x` is non-zero inside the loop. However, the loop updates `x` with both positive and negative values of `y`. Since `y` is assumed to be non-zero, the updates will eventually cancel out and `x` will become 0.\n    - `y != 0`: This invariant ensures that `y` is non-zero after the loop terminates. Since `y` is assigned a non-zero value inside the loop and never changed to 0, the invariant holds. \n    - `n > 0`: This invariant ensures that `n` is greater than 0 after the loop terminates. Since `n` is assumed to be greater than 0 before the loop execution and is never changed inside the loop, the invariant holds.",
