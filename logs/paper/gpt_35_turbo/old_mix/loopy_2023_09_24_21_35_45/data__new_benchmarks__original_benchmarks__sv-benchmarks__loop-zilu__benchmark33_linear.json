The implication `(x < 100 && x >= 0) ==> (x+1 < 100 && x+1 >= 0)` is true because incrementing `x` by 1 will not make it greater than or equal to 100, and it will remain greater than or equal to 0.\n- After the loop terminates, `x` is either greater than or equal to 100 or less than 0. This is because the loop condition is false, which means either `x` is greater than or equal to 100 or less than 0.

Therefore, `0<=x && x<100` is true in every iteration of the loop.\n- After the loop termination, `x>=100` is the post-condition that needs to be verified.

We know that `x` should be greater than or equal to 0, since the loop condition checks for this. Therefore, the loop invariant `x>=0` holds before the loop execution.\n- In every iteration of the loop, `x` is incremented by 1. Since the loop condition is `x<100 && x>=0`, we know that `x` will always be between 0 and 100 (inclusive) during the loop execution. Therefore, the loop invariant `x>=0 && x<=100` holds in every iteration of the loop. Also, since `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, we know that `x+1` will be between 1 and 100 (inclusive) if `x<100`. Therefore, the loop invariant `x<100 ==> x+1>=1 && x+1<=100` holds in every iteration of the loop.\n- After the loop termination, we know that `x` is greater than or equal to 100, since the loop condition is `x<100 && x>=0` and the loop terminates when `x` is no longer less than 100.
