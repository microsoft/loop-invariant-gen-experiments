So, the first loop invariant `sn == (i-1)*a` holds true.\n- In every iteration of the loop, `sn` is incremented by `a` and `i` is incremented by `1`. So, the loop invariant `sn == (i-1)*a` holds true.\n- After the loop termination, `i` is `SIZE+1` and `sn` is `SIZE*a`. So, the loop invariant `sn == (i-1)*a` implies the post-condition `sn == SIZE*a`.\n- The loop invariant `i >= 1` ensures that `i` does not become negative during the loop execution.\n- The loop invariant `i <= SIZE+1` ensures that `i` does not exceed the value `SIZE+1` after the loop terminates. \n- Since all variables are explicitly initialized and there are no non-deterministic variables in the program, we do not need to add any additional loop invariants to make the existing ones hold true. \n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the given program are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant sn == (i-1)*a;\n    loop invariant i >= 1;\n    loop invariant i <= SIZE+1;\n*/\n```"

It holds before the loop execution and in every iteration because `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration and the loop condition is `i<=SIZE`.\n- The second invariant states that `sn` is equal to the sum of the first `i-1` terms of the series. It holds before the loop execution because `sn` is initialized to 0 and `i` is initialized to 1. It holds in every iteration because the loop body adds `a` to `sn` and increments `i` by 1. It holds after the loop termination because the loop condition is `i<=SIZE` and the last value of `i` is `SIZE+1`.\n- The third invariant states that `sn` is less than or equal to `SIZE*a`. It holds before the loop execution because `sn` is initialized to 0. It holds in every iteration because the loop body adds `a` to `sn`. It holds after the loop termination because the last value of `i` is `SIZE+1`.\n- The fourth invariant states that `sn` is greater than or equal to 0. It holds before the loop execution because `sn` is initialized to 0. It holds in every iteration because the loop body adds `a` to `sn`. It holds after the loop termination because the last value of `i` is `SIZE+1`.\n\nThese loop invariants imply the post-condition because:\n- `sn == (i-1)*a` implies that `sn` is a multiple of `a`.\n- `sn <= SIZE*a` implies that `sn` is less than or equal to the maximum possible value of `sn`, which is `SIZE*a`.\n- `sn >= 0` implies that `sn` is greater than or equal to the minimum possible value of `sn`, which is 0.\nTherefore, the only possible values of `sn` are `0`, `a`, `2a`, ..., `SIZE*a`. Thus, the post-condition `sn==SIZE*a || sn == 0` holds."
