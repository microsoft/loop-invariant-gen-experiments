The loop increases the value of `i` by 1 in each iteration, so `i` is still in the range 1 to `n+1`. The loop increases the value of `sn` by `a` in each iteration except when `i` is equal to 4, in which case `sn` is assigned -10. Therefore, `sn` is either equal to `(i-1)*a` or -10 in each iteration. \n- (iii) After the loop termination, both loop invariants hold true.
