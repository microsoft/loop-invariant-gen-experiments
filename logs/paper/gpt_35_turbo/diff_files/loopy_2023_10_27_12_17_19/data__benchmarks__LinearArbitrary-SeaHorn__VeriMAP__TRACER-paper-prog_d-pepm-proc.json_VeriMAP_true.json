The loop body increments the variables `y` and `x` by 1. The post-condition checks if the sum of `y` and `x` is less than 10000. Therefore, we need to find loop invariants that ensure that `y` and `x` are incremented by 1 in every iteration of the loop and that the sum of `y` and `x` is less than 10000 after the loop termination.\n\nWe can use the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0 && x <= 10000;\n    loop invariant y >= \\old(y) && y >= 0 && y <= \\old(y) + 10000 - x;\n    loop invariant x + y <= 10000;\n*/\n```\nLet's explain each of the loop invariants:\n- The first loop invariant ensures that `x` is always between 0 and 10000.\n- The second loop invariant ensures that `y` is always greater than or equal to its previous value (`\\old(y)`), and that `y` is between 0 and the maximum possible value of `y` (`\\old(y) + 10000 - x`). The maximum possible value of `y` is the difference between 10000 and the current value of `x`.\n- The third loop invariant ensures that the sum of `x` and `y` is always less than or equal to 10000.\n\nThe first loop invariant is always true before the loop execution, as `x` is initialized to 0, and it is incremented by 1 in every iteration of the loop.\n\nThe second loop invariant is true before the loop execution, as `y` is non-negative and `\\old(y)` is equal to the initial value of `y`. In every iteration of the loop, `y` is incremented by 1, which satisfies the condition `y >= \\old(y)`. Also, the maximum possible value of `y` is `\\old(y) + 10000 - x`, which satisfies the condition `y <= \\old(y) + 10000 - x`.\n\nThe third loop invariant is true before the loop execution, as the sum of `x` and `y` is initially equal to 0. In every iteration of the loop, `x` and `y` are incremented by 1, which ensures that their sum is always less than or equal to 10000.\n\nAfter the loop termination, the second and third loop invariants ensure that `y` and `x + y` are less than or equal to 10000. Therefore, the post-condition is satisfied.\n\nNote: We do not need to add any loop invariant that involves the non-deterministic value returned by `unknown_uint()`, as it is only used to initialize the variable `y`, and its value is not used in the loop or the post-condition.",

Also, `x` is initialized with 0, so `x >= 0`. Since the loop condition is `x < 10000`, we know that `x` is less than or equal to 10000, so `x <= 10000`. Finally, since `y` is non-negative and `x` is 0 or greater, `y + x` is less than or equal to 10000, so `y + x <= 10000`. \n- In every iteration of the loop, `y` is incremented by 1 and `x` is incremented by 1, so both `y` and `x` remain non-negative and `x` remains less than or equal to 10000. Therefore, `y >= 0 && x >= 0 && x <= 10000` holds. Also, since `y + x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, `y + x` remains less than or equal to 10000, so `y + x <= 10000` holds.\n- After the loop termination, we know that `x` is greater than or equal to 10000, since the loop condition `x < 10000` is false. Therefore, `y + x` is greater than or equal to 10000, so `y + x < 10000 ==> \\false` holds. This implies the post-condition of the program, which is that the assertion `\\false` holds.",
