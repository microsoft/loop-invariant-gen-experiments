It is true before the loop starts, as `j` is initialized to 0. It is also true during the loop execution, as `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration and the loop continues only if `j < n`. After the loop termination, `j` will either be equal to `n` or will have found the value `q` in the array.\n2. `j == 20 ==> j == (unsigned int)-1`: This invariant states that if `j` becomes 20, it will be set to `(unsigned int)-1`. This is true before the loop starts since `j` is initialized to 0. It is also true during the loop execution, as the code explicitly sets `j` to `(unsigned int)-1` when `j == 20`. After the loop termination, this condition will be trivially true if `j` never reached 20 or it will hold the last assigned value.\n3. `\\forall integer k; 0 <= k < j ==> a[k] != q`: This invariant states that all elements in the array before index `j` are not equal to `q`. It is true before the loop starts, as there are no elements before index 0. It is also true during the loop execution, as the loop continues only if `a[j] != q`. After the loop termination, either all elements in the array have been checked and none of them are equal to `q`, or the value `q` has been found at index `j`."
