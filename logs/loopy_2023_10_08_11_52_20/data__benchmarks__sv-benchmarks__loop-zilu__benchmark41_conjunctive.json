Thus, the second part of the assertion also holds true.\n\nFor the last part of the assertion, let's substitute z with -2 times the number of iterations:\n```\nx + y + (-2 * iterations) == 0\n```\nSince x and y are incremented by 1 in each iteration, the sum of x and y will be equal to 2 times the number of iterations.

Since x and y are always incremented by the same value, it will always hold that x == y.\n\nFurthermore, since x and y start at 0, x and y will always be non-negative.\n\nNow, let's consider the sum x + y + z. Initially, it is 0 (precondition). In each iteration of the loop, x + y increases by 2, and z decreases by 2, so their sum remains 0.
