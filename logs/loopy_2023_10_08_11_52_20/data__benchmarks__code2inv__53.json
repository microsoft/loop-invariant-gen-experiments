So, it is not possible to conclude anything about the value of c after the loop.\n\n- If the loop takes a mix of the first and second branches, we still cannot conclude anything about the value of c after the loop.\n\nSince we cannot make any conclusions about the value of c after the loop, we cannot guarantee that the assertion will always evaluate to true.
