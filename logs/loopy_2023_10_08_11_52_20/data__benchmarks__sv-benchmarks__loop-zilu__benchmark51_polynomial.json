This satisfies the assertion.\n- If `0 < x < 50`, `x` will be decremented by 1 in each iteration. Since the loop can continue indefinitely (based on `unknown_bool()`), it is possible that `x` eventually becomes 0. In this case, the next iteration will increment `x` back to 1, which still satisfies the assertion.\n\nAs a result, the assertion holds in all scenarios.
