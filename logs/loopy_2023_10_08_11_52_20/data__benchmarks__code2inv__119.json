For example: \n```\n//@ assert x > 0;\n```\n\nInstructions:\n- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. \n- Check if the assertion expression is reachable and evaluates to true, for the given pre-conditions and the loop condition.\n- If the assertion is true, label the program True. If the assertion is false, label the program False.\n\nRules:\n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values.**\n- **Variables that are not explicitly initialized, could have garbage values. Do not make any assumptions about such values.**\n- **Check if the assertion is reachable, given the pre-conditions and the loop. If it is reachable, check if the assertion evaluates to true.

Since 'size' is uninitialized, it could have a garbage value. Let's consider the following cases:\n\n- Case 1: size is initialized to a non-negative value. In this case, the loop will execute 'size' times. After each iteration, both 'i' and 'sn' will be incremented by 1. So, at the end of the loop, 'sn' will be equal to 'size'. If 'size' is positive, the assertion will be true since (sn == size) and sn is not 0.\n\n- Case 2: size is initialized to a negative value. In this case, the loop will not execute since the loop condition (i <= size) is false. The value of 'sn' remains 0. The if-statement condition (sn != 0) will be false, and the assertion will not be reachable.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the assertion is either true or not reachable.
