Now, we have to analyze the loop body to determine if the assertion evaluates to true.\n\nLet's analyze the loop body for the two cases: y % 2 == 0 (even) and y % 2 != 0 (odd).\n\nCase 1: y % 2 == 0 (even)\n- x += 2; // x = 2\n- x += 2; // x = 4\n- x += 2; // x = 6\n- x += 2; // x = 8\n- x += 2; // x = 10\n- x += 2; // x = 12\n- x += 2; // x = 14\n- x += 2; // x = 16\n- x += 2; // x = 18\n- x += 2; // x = 20\n\nCase 2: y % 2 != 0 (odd)\n- x += 1; // x = 1\n- x -= 2; // x = -1 (since x is unsigned, it wraps around, and x becomes a very large value)\n- x += 2; // x becomes a very large value\n- x -= 2; // x becomes a very large value\n- x += 2; // x becomes a very large value\n- x -= 4; // x becomes a very large value\n- x += 4; // x becomes a very large value\n- x += 2; // x becomes a very large value\n- x -= 4; // x becomes a very large value\n- x -= 4; // x becomes a very large value\n\nIn the second case, when y is odd, x becomes a very large value after the first two steps in the loop body. This means x will quickly exceed 99, and the loop will exit.\n\nSo, in either case (even or odd), when the loop exits and the assertion is reached, (x % 2) will be equal to (y % 2).
