For example: \n```\n//@ assert x > 0;\n```\n\nInstructions:\n- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. \n- Check if the assertion expression is reachable and evaluates to true, for the given pre-conditions and the loop condition.\n- If the assertion is true, label the program True. If the assertion is false, label the program False.\n\nRules:\n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values.**\n- **Variables that are not explicitly initialized, could have garbage values. Do not make any assumptions about such values.**\n- **Check if the assertion is reachable, given the pre-conditions and the loop. If it is reachable, check if the assertion evaluates to true. If it evaluates to true, label the program True.

Inside the loop, `m` can be updated to `x` if the `unknown()` function returns a non-zero value (true). After the loop, `x` will be equal to `n`. Therefore, the maximum value of `m` will be `n - 1`. Since the if-statement `if (n > 1)` is executed, `n` must be greater than 1, so `m` will always be less than `n`.\n\nGiven these conditions, the assertion `m < n` will evaluate to true.\n\nFinal label: <label> True </label>"
