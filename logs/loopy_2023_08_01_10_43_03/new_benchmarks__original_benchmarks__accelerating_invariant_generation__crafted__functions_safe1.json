Before the loop execution: `x` is initialized to 0, so it's an even number.\n2. In every iteration of the loop: In the loop body, we call the function `f(x)`, which adds 2 to `x`. Since the sum of two even numbers is always even, `x` remains even throughout the loop iterations.\n3. After the loop termination: When the loop terminates, `x` must still be even.\n\nIn addition, we need to add the following conjunctions and relations:\n- `x` is always less than or equal to `0x0fffffff`.\n- When the loop is not executing (i.e., before the loop execution and after the loop termination), the loop invariant should be trivially true.\n\nHere are the updated loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x % 2 == 0;\n    loop invariant x <= 0x0fffffff;\n    loop invariant !(x < 0x0fffffff) ==> x % 2 == 0;\n*/\n```"
