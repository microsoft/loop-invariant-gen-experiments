The `__VERIFIER_assert(x != 0)` statement confirms this.\n4. `(i == n) ==> (x == 0)`: This invariant is true because when i equals n, the loop terminates, and at this point, x must be 0 as per the post-condition `__VERIFIER_assert(x == 0)`.\n\nThese invariants cover the minimum and maximum values of i and the relationship between i and x. The variable y is non-deterministic in each iteration, so it doesn't have a specific relationship with i or x. However, the invariants ensure that the post-condition holds."
