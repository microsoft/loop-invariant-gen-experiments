It holds true before the loop, during each iteration, and after the loop termination.\n- `sn >= 0`: This invariant states that `sn` is always non-negative. Since `sn` is only incremented by 2, it stays non-negative throughout the loop.\n- `sn <= 2*i`: This invariant states that `sn` is always less than or equal to twice the value of `i`. It holds true before the loop, during each iteration, and after the loop termination.\n- `j == 10 - (i-1)`: This invariant states that `j` is always equal to 10 minus the difference between `i` and 1. This relationship holds true throughout the loop since `j` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, and `i` is incremented by 1.\n- `i <= j ==> sn == 2*(i-1)`: This invariant uses implication to account for the conditional nature of the code. If `i` is less than or equal to `j`, the value of `sn` is equal to twice the difference between `i` and 1.\n- `i > j ==> (sn == 2*j || sn == 2*(j+1))`: This invariant also uses implication. If `i` is greater than `j`, the value of `sn` is either equal to twice the value of `j` or equal to twice the value of `j` plus 2.\n- `n > 0 ==> (sn == n*(2) || sn == 0)`: This invariant takes into account the non-deterministic nature of `n`.
