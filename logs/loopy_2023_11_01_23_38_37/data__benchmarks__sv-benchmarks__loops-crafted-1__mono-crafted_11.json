The first if-statement checks if `x` is less than 10000000, and if so, increments `x` by 1. The second if-statement checks if `x` is greater than or equal to 10000000, and if so, increments `x` by 2.\n2. The loop condition is `x < 100000000`.\n\nBased on the loop body and the loop condition, we can identify the following loop invariants:\n\n1. Before the loop execution, `x` is equal to 0.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, `x` is either incremented by 1 or incremented by 2.\n3. After the loop termination, `x` is equal to 100000000.\n\nTo verify the post-condition, we need to show that the loop invariants imply the post-condition. In this case, the post-condition is `(x%2)==0`, which means that `x` is even.\n\nWe can show that the loop invariants imply the post-condition as follows:\n\n1. Before the loop execution, `x` is equal to 0, which is even.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, `x` is either incremented by 1 or incremented by 2. If `x` is incremented by 1, it remains even. If `x` is incremented by 2, it becomes even.\n3. After the loop termination, `x` is equal to 100000000, which is even.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the loop invariants imply the post-condition, and the loop is correctly verified.\n\nHere is the ACSL annotation for the loop:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x%2==0;\n    loop invariant x<100000000;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used the `%` operator to check if `x` is even.
