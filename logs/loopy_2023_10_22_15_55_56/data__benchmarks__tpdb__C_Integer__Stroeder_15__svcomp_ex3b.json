The value of the expression must decrease with every successive iteration of the loop. And the value must be positive for the loop to continue executing. Finding a ranking function that helps prove that the loop must terminate.\nLexicographic ranking functions are a generation. They are a sequence of expressions (e1, e2, ...) with the property that the value of each expression must be positive for the loop to execute. Either e1 must decrease or its value remains the same. If its value remains the same then the value of e2 must decrease.\nFind the ranking function for the loop in the following program and explain why it is a valid ranking function.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make note of the starting values or constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head.\n- Analyze the loop body and find a ranking function involving the variables in the loop body\n- Output the ranking function in one code block, in ACSL syntax. For example,\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant v;\n*/\n```\n- If the ranking function is a sequence of expressions, output them in different lines in their lexicographic order. \n\nRules:\n- **Do not use constants or functions not defined in the program.

It is positive while the loop is executing since x < y.\n2.

Find a ranking function involving the variables in the loop body:\n\nBased on the analysis above, we can propose a lexicographic ranking function involving x and y as follows:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant y - x;\n    loop variant x;\n*/\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- The first expression, y - x, is guaranteed to be positive while the loop is executing, since x must be less than y for the loop condition to be true.\n- In every iteration, x is squared, which means that it will either remain the same (if x == 1) or increase. However, the loop condition requires x to be greater than 1, which means that x will always increase in every iteration, making the second expression, x, a valid decreasing ranking function.\n- Since x is increasing and y - x is positive, the lexicographic ranking function ensures that the loop will eventually terminate.",

Let's check if it satisfies the conditions:\n\n1. The value of the expression `y - x` is positive while the loop is executing since `x < y` is part of the loop condition.\n2. With each iteration, `x` is updated to `x * x`, which means that `x` is increasing as long as `x > 1`.

At that point, the loop will terminate. \n\nWe can use `y - x` as a ranking function since its value will decrease with every iteration.
