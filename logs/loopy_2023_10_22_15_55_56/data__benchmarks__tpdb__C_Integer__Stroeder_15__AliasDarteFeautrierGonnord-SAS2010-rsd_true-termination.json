Lexicographic ranking functions are a sequence of expressions (e1, e2, ...) with the property that the value of each expression must be positive for the loop to execute. Either e1 must decrease or its value remains the same. If its value remains the same then the value of e2 must decrease.\nGiven a program with a ranking function for the loop in the program, find loop invariants that support the validity of the ranking function and prove the termination of the loop.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make note of the starting values or constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition and the given ranking function.\n- Output loop invariants that are true \n(i) before the loop execution, \n(ii) in every iteration of the loop and \n(iii) after the loop termination, \nsuch that the loop invariants imply that the ranking function decreases with every iteration.\n- If a loop invariant is a conjunction, split it into its parts.\n- Output all the loop invariants in one code block.
