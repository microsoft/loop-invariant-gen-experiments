The loop continues to execute while `x > 0` and `x < y`.\n\nNow we need to find a ranking function that decreases with every iteration of the loop and is positive while the loop is executing.\n\nSince `x` is always positive and `x < y`, we can use the difference `(y - x)` as a part of our ranking function. In each iteration, `x` increases by a factor of 2, and `y` increases by 1. This means that the difference `(y - x)` decreases in every iteration.\n\nThe lexicographic ranking function for this loop is:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant y - x;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because:\n1.

In each iteration, `x` is doubled (`x = 2*x`), and `y` is incremented by 1 (`y = y + 1`). \n\nSince `x` is doubled in each iteration, it will eventually reach a value larger than or equal to `y`, causing the loop to terminate.
