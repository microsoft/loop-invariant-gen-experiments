The loop continues to execute as long as x > 0 and y > 0.\n\n2. Analyzing the loop body:\n   - There are two branches inside the loop, controlled by the unknown_int() function.\n   - In the first branch: x is decreased by 1, and y is set to the old value of x.\n   - In the second branch: x is set to the old value of y minus 2, and y is set to the old value of x plus 1.\n\n3.

Analyzing the loop body, we can see that in each iteration, either `x` decreases by 1 or `y` decreases by 2. If `x` decreases by 1, then `y` is set to the old value of `x`. If `y` decreases by 2, then `x` is set to the old value of `y - 2`.\n\n3. Based on the above observations, we can create a lexicographic ranking function `(e1, e2)` as follows:\n\ne1 = x + y\ne2 = y\n\nThis ranking function is valid because:\n\n- Both `e1` and `e2` are positive when the loop executes (`x > 0 && y > 0`).\n- In each iteration, either `e1` decreases (when `x` decreases by 1, and `y` remains unchanged) or `e1` remains the same, and `e2` decreases (when `y` decreases by 2, and `x` remains unchanged).\n\nSo the ranking function is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x + y;\n    loop variant y;\n*/\n```",

For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **Assume all uninitialized variables to contain garbage values.**\n- **Assume non-deterministic functions to return any value permitted by its return type.**\n- **Do not use keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops.**\n- **Use the expression \"\\at(x, LoopEntry)\" to refer to the value of a variable \"x\" at the beginning of the loop.**"
