In each iteration of the loop, `y` is increased by `x` and `z` is decreased by `x`. Since `x` can be either positive or negative, we can't guarantee that either `y` or `z` is strictly increasing or decreasing. However, we can observe that the sum `y + z` is decreasing in every iteration:\n\n```\ny_new + z_new = (y + x) + (z - x) = y + z = y_old + z_old\n```\n\nSo, a valid ranking function for this loop would be `y + z`.

Since `x` can be positive or negative, either `y` increases or `z` increases. In either case, `(100 - y) + (100 - z)` will decrease in each iteration.\n\nThus, `(100 - y) + (100 - z)` is a valid ranking function for this loop, proving that the loop must terminate.",

Since there are 10 if-else statements, x can be any odd integer between -19 and 19 (inclusive), except for 0.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body and find a ranking function involving the variables in the loop body:\n\nThe loop continues executing while y < 100 and z < 100. In each iteration of the loop, y is incremented by x, and z is decremented by x. Since x is never 0, either y or z will always move away from 100 in each iteration.\n\nA valid ranking function would be the sum of the absolute differences of y and z from 100, since this value will decrease with every iteration of the loop and be positive while the loop is executing.
