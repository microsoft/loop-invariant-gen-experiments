Since unknown_int() can return any integer value, there are no specific constraints on the initial values of i, j, and k.\n\nNext, let's analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition and the given ranking function. The loop condition is \"i <= 100 && j <= k\", and the given ranking function is (100 - i, k - i).\n\nNow, let's output the loop invariants that are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination, such that the loop invariants imply that the ranking function decreases with every iteration.\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i >= \\at(i, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant j >= \\at(j, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant k <= \\at(k, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant i <= 100;\n    loop invariant j <= k + 1;\n*/\n```\n\nThese loop invariants satisfy the requirements:\n- Before the loop execution, i is equal to its initial value, j is equal to its initial value, and k is equal to its initial value.\n- In every iteration of the loop, i is non-decreasing, j is non-decreasing, and k is non-increasing.\n- After the loop termination, i must be greater than 100 or j must be greater than k, which ensures that the loop condition is no longer satisfied.\n\nThese loop invariants, combined with the loop condition and the given ranking function (100 - i, k - i), imply that the ranking function decreases with every iteration and thus proves the termination of the loop.",
                    "First, let's analyze the program and find the starting values and constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head:\n- i, j, and k are assigned by unknown_int() which returns any integer value, so there is no constraint on their initial values.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition and the given ranking function:\n- Loop condition: i <= 100 && j <= k\n- Ranking function: (100 - i, k - i)\n\nNow, we will output the loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= i <= 100;\n    loop invariant i <= j <= k;\n    loop invariant k <= 100;\n*/\n```",

The first loop invariant ensures that i is always between 0 and 100. This is true before the loop execution, in every iteration, and after the loop termination.\n2. The second loop invariant states that j is always equal to the value of i + 1 at the beginning of the loop. This is true in every iteration since j is updated to i + 1 in the loop body.\n3. The third loop invariant states that k is always equal to the value of k - 1 at the beginning of the loop. This is true in every iteration since k is decremented by 1 in the loop body.\n\nThese loop invariants imply that the ranking function (100 - i, k - i) decreases with every iteration, proving the loop termination.",
