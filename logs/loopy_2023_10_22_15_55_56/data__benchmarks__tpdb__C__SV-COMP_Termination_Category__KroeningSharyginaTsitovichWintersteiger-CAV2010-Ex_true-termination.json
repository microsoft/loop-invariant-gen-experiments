The value of the expression must decrease with every successive iteration of the loop. And the value must be positive for the loop to continue executing. Finding a ranking function that helps prove that the loop must terminate.\nLexicographic ranking functions are a generation. They are a sequence of expressions (e1, e2, ...) with the property that the value of each expression must be positive for the loop to execute. Either e1 must decrease or its value remains the same. If its value remains the same then the value of e2 must decrease.\nFind the ranking function for the loop in the following program and explain why it is a valid ranking function.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make note of the starting values or constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head.\n- Analyze the loop body and find a ranking function involving the variables in the loop body\n- Output the ranking function in one code block, in ACSL syntax. For example,\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant v;\n*/\n```\n- If the ranking function is a sequence of expressions, output them in different lines in their lexicographic order. \n\nRules:\n- **Do not use constants or functions not defined in the program. Use the ternary operator to describe the absolute value of an expression.**"

Analyze the loop body and find a ranking function involving the variables in the loop body.\n\nIn the loop body, `i` will either increase by 1 or 2, depending on the condition `unknown_int()`.

Its initial value is unknown, and the loop condition is `i < 255`.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body. In the loop body, `i` is either incremented by 1 or by 2, depending on the value of `unknown_int()`. This means that the value of `i` is strictly increasing in each iteration, and thus the loop will eventually terminate.\n\nWe can use the upper bound of the loop condition (255) and the value of `i` to form the ranking function. Since `i` is strictly increasing, the value of `(255 - i)` will be strictly decreasing in each iteration. Additionally, the value of `(255 - i)` will always be positive while the loop is executing due to the loop condition `i < 255`.\n\nSo, the ranking function for this loop is `(255 - i)`.
