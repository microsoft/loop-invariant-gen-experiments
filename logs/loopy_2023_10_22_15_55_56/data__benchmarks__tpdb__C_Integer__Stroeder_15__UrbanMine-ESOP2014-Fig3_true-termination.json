Inside the loop, there are two main branches:\n\n1. If `x > 0`, either `x` decreases by 1 and `y` is assigned an unknown value or `y` decreases by 1.\n2.

Moreover, the value of `x` is either increasing or decreasing, but never constant. Therefore, we can use the absolute value of `x` as the first lexicographic ranking function.\n\nFor the second lexicographic ranking function, we can use `y`, since its value is always positive inside the loop and it decreases in some branches.\n\nNow, let's output the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant abs(x);\n    loop variant y;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because the absolute value of `x` decreases or stays the same with every iteration of the loop, and the value of `y` decreases when the value of `abs(x)` remains the same.

We can also consider the value of `y` in the ranking function. The loop will terminate if either `x` becomes 0 or `y` becomes 0 or negative.\n\nA valid ranking function (sequence of expressions) for this loop is `abs(x)` and `y`.
