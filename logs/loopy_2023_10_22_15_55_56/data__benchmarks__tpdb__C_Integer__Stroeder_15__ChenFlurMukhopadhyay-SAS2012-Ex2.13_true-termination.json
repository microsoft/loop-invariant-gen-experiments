            "1. Make note of the starting values or constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head.\nIn this program, the variables x and y are live at the loop head. They are assigned unknown values initially.\n\n2. Analyze the loop body and find a ranking function involving the variables in the loop body.\nThe loop condition is `x - y > 0`, and the loop body updates the variables as follows:\n- x = y - x\n- y = y + 1\n\nNow, let's find a ranking function for this loop.\n\nConsider the difference between x and y as the ranking function: `x - y`\n\nBefore the loop body executes, the loop condition ensures that `x - y > 0`. So, the ranking function is positive.\n\nAfter the loop body executes, we have:\n\n- x_new = y_old - x_old\n- y_new = y_old + 1\n\nNow, the ranking function after the loop body execution is `x_new - y_new`:\n\nx_new - y_new = (y_old - x_old) - (y_old + 1) = -x_old - 1\n\nNotice that the ranking function does not necessarily decrease with every iteration. However, we can use a lexicographic ranking function to ensure that at least one of the expressions in the sequence decreases:\n\n- e1 = x - y\n- e2 = -y\n\nNow, let's check if these expressions are valid as a lexicographic ranking function:\n\n- e1 is positive initially (as ensured by the loop condition)\n- e2 is negative initially (since y is an unknown integer)\n\nAfter the loop body executes:\n\n- e1_new = x_new - y_new = -x_old - 1\n- e2_new = -y_new = -(y_old + 1)\n\nNow, if e1 remains the same, then e2 must decrease. Since e2 is negative and e1 is positive, the loop will eventually terminate when e1 is no longer positive.\n\nSo, the lexicographic ranking function is valid. Output the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x - y;\n    loop variant -y;\n*/\n```",
            "First, let's note the starting values or constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head:\n- `x` and `y` are assigned arbitrary integer values from the `unknown_int()` function.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body:\n- The loop condition is `x - y > 0`, which means that `x` must be greater than `y` for the loop to execute.\n- In the loop body, `x` is updated to `y - x`, and `y` is incremented by `1`.\n\nWe can now find a ranking function involving the variables in the loop body. Since the loop condition requires `x > y`, let's consider the difference `x - y` as our ranking function.\n\nHere's the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x - y;\n*/\n```\n\nThis is a valid ranking function because:\n- It is positive while the loop is executing, as required by the loop condition (`x - y > 0`).\n- It decreases with every successive iteration of the loop. In each iteration, `x` is updated to `y - x`, and `y` is incremented by `1`. This results in a decrease in the value of `x - y`.",

Analyze the loop body and find a ranking function involving the variables in the loop body:\n- The loop condition is (x - y > 0).\n- In the loop body, x is updated as (y - x) and y is updated as (y + 1).\n\nNow, let's find a ranking function for this loop. \n\nWe can use the lexicographic ranking function with two expressions:\n1. The first expression can be the absolute difference between x and y, which is decreasing in each iteration.\n2. The second expression can be the value of y, which is increasing in each iteration.\n\nThe ranking function would be:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x - y;\n    loop variant y;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because:\n1. x - y > 0 is the loop condition, and the value of (x - y) decreases with every successive iteration since x is updated as (y - x).\n2. The value of y increases with every iteration (y = y + 1), ensuring that the lexicographic order is maintained.",

Since we do not have any information about the values of `unknown_int()`, we cannot assume any specific starting values for `x` and `y`.\n\nNow let's analyze the loop body and find a ranking function involving the variables in the loop body:\n\n```c\nwhile (x - y > 0) {\n    x = y - x;\n    y = y + 1;\n}\n```\n\nWe can see that in every iteration of the loop, `x` gets the value `y - x` and `y` gets incremented by 1. We can also see that the loop continues to execute while `x - y > 0`. Let's try to find a ranking function that decreases with every iteration and remains positive as long as the loop executes.\n\nThe ranking function can be `x - y`. In every iteration:\n\n1. `x` becomes `y - x`.\n2. `y` becomes `y + 1`.\n\nSo, the new value of the ranking function is `(y - x) - (y + 1) = -x - 1`. Since the loop condition requires `x - y > 0`, it means that `x > y`. Therefore, the ranking function is positive while the loop executes.\n\nNow we need to check if the new value of the ranking function is strictly smaller than the old value. Let's compare `x - y` and `-x - 1`:\n\n```\nx - y > -x - 1\n2x > y + 1\n```\n\nAs `y` gets incremented by 1 in every iteration, we can see that the ranking function is strictly decreasing.\n\nSo the ranking function is `x - y`. In ACSL syntax:\n\n```c\n/*@\n    loop variant x - y;\n*/\n```",

This is because:\n\n- The value of `x - y` is positive for the loop to execute, as per the loop condition.\n- In every iteration of the loop, `x` is updated to the value of `y - x`, and `y` is incremented by 1. This means that the difference between `x` and `y` will decrease in every iteration.\n\nSo, the ranking function for the loop in the given program is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x - y;\n*/\n```\n\nThis is a valid ranking function because it is decreasing with every iteration of the loop, and it evaluates to a positive value while the loop is executing."
