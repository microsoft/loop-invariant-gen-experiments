The loop continues executing as long as `b` is not 0.\n\nNow let's find a ranking function for the loop:\n\nThe variable `x` is decreasing with every iteration, and the loop continues executing as long as `x >= 0`.

Since we don't know the exact values, we can only assume that x and b are both integers.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body and find a ranking function involving the variables in the loop body.\n\n1. The loop has a conditional break statement `if (!b) { break; }`. This means that the loop will continue executing as long as b is non-zero (positive or negative).\n2. The value of b is updated using `b = unknown_int();` and `b = (x >= 0);`. Since we don't know the exact value of `unknown_int()`, we can't use it in our ranking function. However, we can use the fact that b is updated to 1 if x is non-negative and 0 if x is negative.\n3. The value of x is decremented in each iteration using `x = x - 1;`.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can see that x is decreasing in each iteration. Also, the loop will continue executing as long as x is non-negative.

In each iteration, the value of `x` is decreased by 1, and `b` is updated based on whether `x >= 0`. The loop continues as long as `b` is not 0, i.e., as long as `x >= 0`. Therefore, the value of `x` is the key to determining the termination of the loop.\n\nThe ranking function we can use here is `x`, as it decreases with every iteration of the loop and must be positive for the loop to continue executing.

In each iteration, `b` is updated with an unknown integer value, `x` is decremented by 1, and `b` is assigned the result of the comparison `(x >= 0)`.\n4. The loop terminates when `b` is false.\n\nNow let's use the loop variant `(x + 1)` and find the loop invariants:\n\n1. Before the loop execution, the loop invariant should be true.\n2. In each iteration of the loop, the loop invariant should be true.\n3. After the loop termination, the loop invariant should be true.\n\nHere are the loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= x + 1;\n    loop invariant b == (x >= 0);\n*/\n```\n\nExplanation of the loop invariants:\n\n1. `0 <= x + 1`: This invariant ensures that the loop variant `(x + 1)` is non-negative, and it decreases with every iteration of the loop.\n2. `b == (x >= 0)`: This invariant captures the relationship between `b` and `x`. Since `b` is assigned the result of the comparison `(x >= 0)`, this invariant holds true during every iteration of the loop."
