Analyze the loop body and find a ranking function involving the variables in the loop body:\n- The loop continues to execute while `y < 100` and `z < 100`.\n- In each iteration, `y` is incremented by `x` and `z` is decremented by `x`.\n\n3. Output the ranking function in one code block, in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant 100 - y;\n    loop variant 100 - z;\n*/\n```\n\nExplanation: \n\nSince `y` and `z` are both bounded by 100, we can use the expressions `100 - y` and `100 - z` as the lexicographic ranking functions. \n\nIn every loop iteration, either `y` is incremented by 1 (if `x == 1`) or `z` is incremented by 1 (if `x == -1`). Therefore, at least one of the two expressions `100 - y` or `100 - z` will be decreasing in every iteration. The loop will terminate when `y` and `z` reach or exceed 100, as the loop conditions require both of them to be less than 100.",

In the loop body, `y` is incremented by `x`, and `z` is decremented by `x`. The loop will terminate when either `y` or `z` reaches or exceeds 100.\n\nA possible ranking function for this loop is the sum of the differences between 100 and `y` and between 100 and `z`. This ranking function is positive as long as the loop continues to execute, and it decreases with every iteration of the loop, as either `y` or `z` gets closer to 100.\n\nThe ranking function can be expressed as:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant (100 - y) + (100 - z);\n*/\n```\n\nLet's verify that this ranking function is indeed valid:\n\n1. The ranking function is positive while the loop is executing: Since `y < 100` and `z < 100`, both `(100 - y)` and `(100 - z)` are positive, and their sum is also positive.\n\n2. The ranking function decreases with every iteration of the loop: In each iteration, either `y` increases (if `x` is 1) or `z` increases (if `x` is -1). In both cases, one of the terms `(100 - y)` or `(100 - z)` decreases, leading to a decrease in the sum.\n\nThus, the ranking function is valid and proves the termination of the loop.",

We can use the distance of y and z to their upper bound, 100, as the ranking function. Since x can be either 1 or -1, we need two expressions to account for both cases.\n\nThe lexicographic ranking function is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant 100 - y;\n    loop variant 100 - z;\n*/\n``` \n\nThis is a valid ranking function because:\n- When x = 1, y increases, and (100 - y) decreases. z decreases, and (100 - z) increases.\n- When x = -1, y decreases, and (100 - y) increases. z increases, and (100 - z) decreases.\n- In both cases, at least one of the expressions decreases with every iteration, and both expressions are positive while the loop is executing.",

Instead, we can consider the lexicographic ranking function (y, z) as our ranking function. We can reason about it as follows:\n\n1. While the loop executes, both y and z are less than 100. Thus, the values of y and z are positive.\n2. If y increases, z decreases, and vice versa.\n3. The loop terminates when y or z reaches 100 or greater.\n\nSo, the lexicographic ranking function (y, z) is a valid ranking function.
