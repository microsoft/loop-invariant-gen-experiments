We can consider x and y separately, and then combine them in a lexicographic ranking function.\n\nFor x:\n- It is updated to x + y - 5.\n- The loop condition is x > 0.\nSo, x itself can be a part of the ranking function as it is positive while the loop is executing, and it decreases in every iteration as long as y - 5 < 0 (i.e., y < 5).\n\nFor y:\n- It is updated to -2 * y.\n- In every iteration, the magnitude of y doubles.\n- The value of y oscillates between positive and negative.\n- The loop condition doesn't impose any constraint on y.\n\nNow, let's combine x and y in a lexicographic ranking function:\n- Since the value of x is updated by y - 5, we can use the absolute value of y - 5 to ensure that it decreases with every iteration.

We will use the absolute value of y, as it is doubling in every iteration, and the maximum possible value of x as the loop invariant expressions.\n\nAs the value of x is decreasing, we can use the upper bound of x as an expression that is decreasing.

The value of both expressions must be positive for the loop to execute. Since the loop continues as long as x > 0, this condition is satisfied for e1. There's no constraint on y's value, but it doesn't affect the loop termination directly, so it's okay for it to be positive or negative.\n\n2. Either e1 must decrease, or if e1 remains the same, e2 must decrease. After each iteration, x is updated with x + y - 5. If y < 5, then x will decrease, making e1 a valid ranking function. When y >= 5, x may not decrease, but in this case, y's value is updated to -2 * y, causing y to decrease, making e2 a valid ranking function.\n\nTherefore, the given lexicographic ranking function (x, y) is valid for the loop in the given program."

The second invariant states that if y is non-positive (y <= 0) at the beginning of the loop, then x is decreasing by at least 5 * (initial y value / 2) in each iteration. This is because x = x + y - 5, and with y <= 0, x is reduced by at least 5 in each iteration.\n\n3. The third invariant states that if y is positive (y > 0) at the beginning of the loop, then x is decreasing by at least 5 * initial y value in each iteration.

The second loop invariant states that if x is non-negative, then the value of x during the loop execution is less than or equal to its value at the beginning of the loop. This is true because in each iteration, x is updated to `x + y - 5`. Since y is updated to `-2*y`, the value of x can only decrease or stay the same in each iteration.\n\n3. The third loop invariant states that if x is non-negative, then the value of y at the beginning of the loop is equal to the negative of twice its value during the loop execution. This is true because y is updated to `-2*y` in each iteration, and the loop continues to execute as long as x remains positive.",
