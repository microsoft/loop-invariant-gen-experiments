Their values are unknown, but we know that 0 <= y <= n and x >= 0.\n\n2. Analyze the loop body and find a ranking function involving the variables in the loop body.\n- The loop has two branches: one where b == 0 and another where b != 0.\n- In the first branch, y increases and b may become 1. In the second branch, y decreases, x may decrease, and b may become 0.\n- We need to find a ranking function that decreases with every iteration and is positive while the loop is executing.\n\nA possible lexicographic ranking function for this loop is (x, n - y, b). Let's explain why it is a valid ranking function.\n\n- x, n - y, and b are all non-negative integers. So, their values are positive while the loop is executing.\n- In the first branch, where b == 0, y increases, which means n - y decreases. Since b may become 1, the value of b remains unchanged or decreases.\n- In the second branch, where b != 0, y decreases, which means n - y increases. However, x may decrease, which means the value of x remains unchanged or decreases. Since b may become 0, the value of b remains unchanged or decreases.\n\nSo, the lexicographic ranking function (x, n - y, b) is valid because it is positive while the loop is executing, and its values either decrease or remain the same with each iteration.\n\nHere is the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n    loop variant n - y;\n    loop variant b;\n*/\n```",

In one branch, `y` is incremented, and in the other branch, `y` is decremented and `x` is decremented with some probability.\n    - We need to find an expression that decreases with every iteration of the loop and is positive while the loop is executing.\n    - Since `y` can be both incremented and decremented, we cannot use it directly as a ranking function. However, we can use the absolute difference between `y` and `n`, which would decrease with every iteration when `y` is decremented, and remain constant when `y` is incremented.\n    - In the branch where `y` is decremented, `x` is also decremented with some probability. Since `x` is non-negative, it can serve as a secondary ranking function.\n\n3. Output the ranking function in one code block, in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant n - y;\n    loop variant x;\n*/\n```\n\nThese ranking functions are valid because:\n- `n - y` decreases with every iteration when `y` is decremented and remains constant when `y` is incremented.

Lexicographic ranking functions are a sequence of expressions (e1, e2, ...) with the property that the value of each expression must be positive for the loop to execute. Either e1 must decrease or its value remains the same. If its value remains the same then the value of e2 must decrease.\nGiven a program with a ranking function for the loop in the program, find loop invariants that support the validity of the ranking function and prove the termination of the loop.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make note of the starting values or constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition and the given ranking function.\n- Output loop invariants that are true \n(i) before the loop execution, \n(ii) in every iteration of the loop and \n(iii) after the loop termination, \nsuch that the loop invariants imply that the ranking function decreases with every iteration.\n- If a loop invariant is a conjunction, split it into its parts.\n- Output all the loop invariants in one code block. For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **Assume all uninitialized variables to contain garbage values.**\n- **Assume non-deterministic functions to return any value permitted by its return type.**\n- **Do not use keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops.**\n- **Use the expression \"\\at(x, LoopEntry)\" to refer to the value of a variable \"x\" at the beginning of the loop.**"
