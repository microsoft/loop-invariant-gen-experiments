The value of the expression must decrease with every successive iteration of the loop. And the value must be positive for the loop to continue executing. Finding a ranking function that helps prove that the loop must terminate.\nLexicographic ranking functions are a generation. They are a sequence of expressions (e1, e2, ...) with the property that the value of each expression must be positive for the loop to execute. Either e1 must decrease or its value remains the same. If its value remains the same then the value of e2 must decrease.\nFind the ranking function for the loop in the following program and explain why it is a valid ranking function.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make note of the starting values or constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head.\n- Analyze the loop body and find a ranking function involving the variables in the loop body\n- Output the ranking function in one code block, in ACSL syntax. For example,\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant v;\n*/\n```\n- If the ranking function is a sequence of expressions, output them in different lines in their lexicographic order. \n\nRules:\n- **Do not use constants or functions not defined in the program.

            "1. Make note of the starting values or constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head.\n\n`number` is an unsigned integer, and its initial value is unknown. However, we know that `number` is positive because it is an unsigned integer. \n\n`width` is an integer and starts with the value of 1.\n\n2. Analyze the loop body and find a ranking function involving the variables in the loop body.\n\nThe loop condition is `number >= 10`. The loop will continue executing as long as `number` is greater than or equal to 10.\n\nIn the loop body, `number` is divided by 10 in each iteration, and `width` is incremented by 1.\n\nNow, let's find the ranking function.\n\nThe ranking function should involve `number`, as it is the variable that determines the loop termination. Since `number` is divided by 10 in each iteration and it is an unsigned integer, it must eventually become less than 10, causing the loop to terminate.\n\nA valid ranking function for this loop is `number`, as it is always positive and strictly decreasing in each iteration as long as the loop continues executing.\n\nSo, the ranking function is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant number;\n*/\n```",

In each iteration of the loop, `number` is divided by 10, and `width` is incremented by 1. The loop continues as long as `number >= 10`.\n\nSince `number` is an unsigned integer, its maximum value is UINT_MAX. In each iteration, `number` is decreasing as it is divided by 10, and the loop terminates when `number < 10`. We can use the logarithm base 10 of `number` as the ranking function, which decreases with each iteration.\n\nHowever, since the logarithm function is not defined in the program, we can alternatively use UINT_MAX - `number` as the ranking function. This expression will decrease with each iteration of the loop as `number` decreases. Moreover, this ranking function evaluates to a positive value as long as `number` is less than UINT_MAX.\n\nNow, let's output the ranking function in one code block, in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant UINT_MAX - number;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because it decreases with every iteration of the loop and is positive while the loop is executing.",

The loop condition is `number >= 10`, and in the loop body, `width` is incremented by 1, and `number` is divided by 10.\n\nWe can use the logarithm function as a ranking function. However, since we cannot use functions not defined in the program, we need to find an alternative expression.\n\nLet's consider the loop condition: `number >= 10`. As long as the loop executes, the value of `number` will be at least 10. This means that the value of `number` will decrease with each iteration, as it is divided by 10.\n\nNow, let's find a ranking function for `width`. Since `width` starts at 1 and is incremented by 1 in each iteration, the value of `width` will always be positive and increasing.\n\nWe can use the following ranking function for this loop:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant (UINT_MAX - width);\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because:\n\n1. The value of the expression `(UINT_MAX - width)` is always positive, as `width` starts at 1 and increases by 1 in each iteration.\n2. The value of the expression `(UINT_MAX - width)` decreases with each successive iteration of the loop, as `width` increases by 1 in each iteration.\n\nThe ranking function ensures that the loop must terminate, as the value of `width` cannot exceed `UINT_MAX`.",
