The value of this expression will always be positive as long as the loop condition holds (`x <= z`). Moreover, the value of `x` increases in every iteration of the loop (`x = 2*x + y`), so the value of `z - x` will decrease in every iteration.\n\nHere is the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant z - x;\n*/\n```",

Inside the loop, we have:\n- x is updated with the value 2*x + y\n- y is updated with the value y + 1\n\nTo find a ranking function, let's analyze the loop body:\n1. x is always non-decreasing because it is updated with a value greater than or equal to its current value (2*x + y, where y is non-negative in the loop).\n2. y is always increasing because it is updated with the value y + 1.\n\nSince x is non-decreasing and y is always increasing, we can use the lexicographic ranking function (x, -y).

It ensures that x is non-decreasing (x remains the same or increases), and the loop continues executing as long as x + y >= 0 and x <= z.\n2.

Since `y` is increasing in every iteration, we can use it as part of our ranking function. Also, as `x` is increasing in the loop body, we can use `z - x` as another part of our ranking function.
