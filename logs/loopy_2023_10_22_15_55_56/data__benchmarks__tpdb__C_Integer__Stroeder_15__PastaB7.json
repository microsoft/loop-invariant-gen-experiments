The value of the expression must decrease with every successive iteration of the loop. And the value must be positive for the loop to continue executing. Finding a ranking function that helps prove that the loop must terminate.\nLexicographic ranking functions are a generation. They are a sequence of expressions (e1, e2, ...) with the property that the value of each expression must be positive for the loop to execute. Either e1 must decrease or its value remains the same. If its value remains the same then the value of e2 must decrease.\nFind the ranking function for the loop in the following program and explain why it is a valid ranking function.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make note of the starting values or constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head.\n- Analyze the loop body and find a ranking function involving the variables in the loop body\n- Output the ranking function in one code block, in ACSL syntax. For example,\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant v;\n*/\n```\n- If the ranking function is a sequence of expressions, output them in different lines in their lexicographic order. \n\nRules:\n- **Do not use constants or functions not defined in the program.

Inside the loop, x and y are both decremented by 1 in every iteration, while z remains unchanged.\n\nNow let's find the ranking function:\n\nThe loop will continue executing as long as both x and y are greater than z. Since x and y are decreasing in every iteration, we can use the difference between x and z, and the difference between y and z as our lexicographic ranking functions.\n\nSo, the lexicographic ranking function is:\n```\n(x - z, y - z)\n```\n\nLet's check if it is valid:\n\n1. The value of each expression must be positive for the loop to execute.\n\n   As long as the loop is executing, x > z and y > z, so both (x - z) and (y - z) are positive.\n\n2.

So, either (x - z) decreases or, if it remains the same, (y - z) must decrease.\n\nThus, the lexicographic ranking function is valid for this loop.

Finding the ranking function:\n   A valid ranking function for this loop is the minimum of the differences between x, y, and z, because it is positive when the loop is executing (since x > z and y > z), and it decreases with every iteration (as x and y are both decremented).\n\nThe ranking function for the loop can be written as:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant min(x - z, y - z);\n*/\n```",
