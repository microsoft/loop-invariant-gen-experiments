Analyze the loop body:\n   - x is decreased by y in each iteration.\n   - y is decreased by z in each iteration.\n   - z is negated in each iteration.\n\nNow let's find the ranking function:\n\nSince the value of y is decreasing by z in each iteration and z alternates between 1 and -1, we can express y as a sequence:\ny = 100, 99, 98, 99, 98, 97, ...\n\nWe can see that y will oscillate between 100 and 97. Therefore, the loop will terminate when x is less than the minimum value in the sequence, which is 97. In this case, the loop variable x is non-increasing, and there is an upper bound to the value of x.\n\nThe ranking function for this loop can be expressed as:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant (x - 97);\n*/\n```\n\nThis is a valid ranking function because:\n\n1. It is positive as long as x >= 0, which is the loop condition.\n2. It is decreasing with every iteration since x is non-increasing.\n3. It involves the variables in the loop body.",

However, we need to account for the fact that y and z are also changing.\n\nNotice that y decreases by an odd number (1, 3, 5, ...) in each iteration. In the first iteration, y decreases by 1, and in the second iteration, y decreases by 3. After that, y starts to increase again by an odd number (5, 7, 9, ...). \n\nWe can use the absolute value of the difference between y and its initial value (100) as the second part of the ranking function. The absolute value can be represented using the ternary operator: `expression > 0 ? expression : -expression`.\n\nSo, the ranking function can be given as a sequence of two expressions, x and the absolute value of the difference between y and its initial value (100).\n\nHere is the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n    loop variant (y - 100) > 0 ? (y - 100) : -(y - 100);\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because x is decreasing in every iteration, and the absolute value of the difference between y and 100 ensures that it remains positive as long as the loop is executing.",

However, we need to ensure that the ranking function is positive while the loop is executing. As the loop continues until x < 0, x will be positive while the loop is executing.\n\nThus, the ranking function for the given loop is x.\n\nIn ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n*/\n```",

Here's why this is a valid ranking function:\n\n1. The value of `x` decreases with every iteration of the loop, as `x = x - y`.\n2. The value of `y` also decreases with every iteration of the loop, as `y = y - z`.\n3. The value of `z` oscillates between 1 and -1, but since it's the last element in the lexicographic ranking function, it does not affect the overall decreasing nature of the ranking function.\n\nThe loop will terminate when `x < 0`, at which point the lexicographic ranking function will no longer be positive.\n\nSo the ranking function for this loop is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n    loop variant y;\n    loop variant z;\n*/\n```",

Since `z` is negated in each iteration, the value of `y` decreases by 1, then increases by 1, and so on. Therefore, the maximum value of `y` is 100, and the minimum value is 98.\n\nNow, let's find a ranking function involving the variables in the loop body. Since `x` is decreasing with each iteration, we can use the difference between `x` and its upper bound as the ranking function. The upper bound of `x` is the initial value of `x`, denoted as `x0`. Thus, the ranking function is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x0 - x;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because it is decreasing with every iteration of the loop (as `x` is decreasing), and it evaluates to a positive value while the loop is executing (since `x` is non-negative at the beginning of each loop iteration)."
