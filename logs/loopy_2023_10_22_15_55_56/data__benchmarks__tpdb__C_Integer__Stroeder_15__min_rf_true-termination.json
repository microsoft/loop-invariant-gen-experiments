            "First, let's make note of the starting values or constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head:\n- x is an unknown integer\n- y is an unknown integer\n- z is uninitialized\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body and find a ranking function involving the variables in the loop body:\n\nIn each iteration, depending on the condition `unknown_int() != 0`, either `y` gets updated to `y+x` or `x` gets updated to `y+x`. In both cases, the sum `x+y` remains the same. Therefore, we can consider the sum `x+y` as a constant.\n\nAdditionally, we can observe that either `x` or `y` gets decremented by 1 in each iteration. This means that after each iteration, the minimum of `x` and `y` decreases. Hence, we can use the minimum of `x` and `y` as the second lexicographic component of our ranking function.\n\nThe ranking function (as a sequence of expressions) would look like this in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x+y;\n    loop variant x>y ? y : x;\n*/\n```",
            "First, let's make note of the starting values or constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head:\n\n- x and y are initialized with unknown_int(), so their initial values are unknown.\n- The loop condition is (y > 0 && x > 0), so both x and y must be positive for the loop to continue executing.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body to find a ranking function involving the variables:\n\n- In each iteration, either x or y is decreased by at least 1 (whichever is the minimum of x and y).\n- The other variable (either y or x) is increased in each iteration.\n- The value of z is updated in each iteration, but it does not affect the loop condition.\n\nConsidering the above points, we can choose the minimum of x and y as the ranking function, as it is guaranteed to decrease in every iteration while the loop condition is true. Thus, the ranking function is min(x, y).\n\nHere is the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant min(x, y);\n*/\n```",
            "First, we need to identify the variables that are live at the loop head. In this case, those are `x`, `y`, and `z`. Note that the starting values of `x` and `y` are unknown, but they are both positive integers.\n\nNext, we analyze the loop body. We can see that in each iteration, either `x` or `y` is updated to a smaller value (by subtracting 1 from `z`, which is the minimum of `x` and `y`). The other variable is updated to the sum of `x` and `y`. Then, `z` is updated to the sum of the new values of `x` and `y`.\n\nTo find a ranking function, we can consider the sum of `x` and `y`:\n\n```\nR(x, y) = x + y\n```\n\nNow let's check if this ranking function is decreasing and positive. In each iteration, one of the variables is decreased by 1, while the other is increased by the value of the minimum of `x` and `y`. However, the sum of `x` and `y` remains the same in every iteration, and it is always positive because `x` and `y` are both positive integers.\n\nTherefore, the ranking function `R(x, y) = x + y` is not a valid ranking function since it does not decrease in each iteration.\n\nInstead, we need to consider a lexicographic ranking function, which is a sequence of expressions that decrease in lexicographic order. We can consider the following lexicographic ranking function:\n\n```\nR1(x, y) = max(x, y)\nR2(x, y) = min(x, y)\n```\n\nIn each iteration, either `x` or `y` is decreased, so the maximum of the two (`R1(x, y)`) will either decrease or stay the same. If the maximum stays the same, the minimum of the two (`R2(x, y)`) will decrease.\n\nNow let's output the lexicographic ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant max(x, y);\n    loop variant min(x, y);\n*/\n```",

The value of z is assigned the minimum of x and y.\n2. Based on the value of unknown_int(), one of the following happens:\n   a. If unknown_int() != 0: y = y + x, x = z - 1, z = y + z.\n   b. If unknown_int() == 0: x = y + x, y = z - 1, z = x + z.\n\nSince z is assigned the minimum of x and y, z will always be positive as long as x and y are positive.\n\nIn each iteration, either x or y is decreased by 1 (z - 1), and the other variable is increased by the value of the minimum of x and y. Since the sum of x and y is decreasing with each iteration, the loop must terminate.\n\nThe ranking function for this loop is the sum of x and y:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x + y;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because:\n1.

In both branches, the loop variables x and y are updated, and z is used as a temporary variable.\n\nFor the first branch:\n- y is updated to y+x, which is non-decreasing.\n- x is updated to z-1, where z is either y or x (whichever is smaller).
