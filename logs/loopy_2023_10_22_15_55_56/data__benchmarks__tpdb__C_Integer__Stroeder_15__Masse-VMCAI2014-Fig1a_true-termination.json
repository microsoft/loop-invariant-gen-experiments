We have two variables `a` and `b`, which are both initialized with unknown values.\n\nThe loop condition is `a >= 0`, so the loop continues executing as long as `a` is non-negative.\n\nNow let's analyze the loop body:\n\n1. `a` is updated by adding `b` to its current value.\n2. If `b >= 0`, then `b` is updated to `-b - 1`.\n3. Otherwise, `b` is updated to `-b`.\n\nWe can observe that the value of `a` will decrease in every iteration when `b` is non-negative, and it will increase when `b` is negative. The value of `b` alternates between negative and non-negative values.\n\nA suitable ranking function for this loop would be the absolute value of `a` plus the absolute value of `b`. This is because, in every iteration, the value of `a` either decreases or increases, while the value of `b` changes its sign.

Else, `b = -b;`\n\nSince the loop condition is `a >= 0`, we need a ranking function that decreases with every iteration and is positive while the loop is executing.\n\nWe can use a lexicographic ranking function with two expressions: `a` and `|b|`.\n\nHere's the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant a;\n    loop variant |b|;\n*/\n```\n\nNow let's explain why it is a valid ranking function:\n\n- The value of `a` decreases with every iteration of the loop, as it is updated with the value of `a + b`. Since `b` changes its sign in each iteration, the value of `a` will decrease.\n- The value of `|b|` also decreases with every iteration when `b >= 0`. When `b < 0`, the value of `|b|` remains the same, but the value of `a` decreases.\n- Both expressions are positive while the loop is executing, as the loop condition `a >= 0` guarantees that `a` is positive, and `|b|` is always non-negative.\n\nHence, the ranking function is valid, and it helps prove that the loop must terminate.",

The loop continues as long as `a >= 0`.\n\nWe can observe that the sum of `a` and `b` remains constant throughout the loop, since we're always adding `b` to `a` and then negating `b`. Let's call this constant sum `c`.\n\nNow, let's find a ranking function involving `a` and `b`. Since the sum of `a` and `b` is constant, we can use `c - a` as our ranking function.
