If `y` increases, `z` will decrease, and vice versa.\n\nThe loop will continue executing as long as both `y` and `z` are less than `100`. \n\nWe need to find a ranking function that is decreasing with every iteration of the loop and evaluates to a positive value while the loop is executing.

The loop will eventually terminate when either y or z reaches 100. To find a ranking function that is decreasing and positive, we can use the upper bound (100) minus the old value of the loop variable in every iteration.\n\nThe ranking function for this loop can be expressed as a lexicographic ranking function with two expressions:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant 100 - y;\n    loop variant 100 - z;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because:\n\n1.

Since y and z are changing with every iteration, we need to find a function that involves both variables and decreases in value with each iteration.\n\nA possible ranking function could be `abs(100 - y) + abs(100 - z)`. Let's verify if it's a valid ranking function:\n\n1. The value of the expression must be positive for the loop to continue executing:\n- `abs(100 - y) >= 0` and `abs(100 - z) >= 0`, so their sum will always be positive while the loop is executing.\n\n2.

The difference between y and 100 increases, and the difference between z and 100 decreases.
