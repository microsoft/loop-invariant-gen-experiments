            "1. Note the starting values or constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head:\n   - `n` is a non-negative integer (`n >= 0`).\n   - `m` is a positive integer (`m > 0`).\n   - `v1` is initialized with the value of `n` (`v1 = n`).\n   - `v2` is initialized to 0 (`v2 = 0`).\n\n2. Analyze the loop body and find a ranking function involving the variables in the loop body:\n   - The loop continues as long as `v1 > 0`.\n   - Inside the loop, `v2` increases by 1 until it reaches `m`, then it resets to 0.\n   - When `v2` increases, `v1` decreases by 1.\n   - The loop must terminate when `v1` reaches 0.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can use the lexicographic ranking function (v1, m - v2):\n\n```c\n/*@\n    loop variant v1;\n    loop variant m - v2;\n*/\n```\n\nThis is a valid ranking function because:\n\n- The value of `v1` is always positive while the loop is executing (`v1 > 0`).\n- The value of `m - v2` is always non-negative, as `v2` is always less than or equal to `m` (`0 <= v2 <= m`).\n- The first expression, `v1`, decreases with every iteration of the loop when `v2 < m`.\n- When `v2` reaches `m`, it resets to 0, and the second expression, `m - v2`, becomes `m`, which is the maximum possible value for this expression. In this case, `v1` does not decrease, but the lexicographic order is still maintained since the second expression increases.\n- Eventually, `v1` will reach 0, and the loop will terminate.",
            "First, let's identify the variables that are live at the loop head and their constraints:\n- v1: it is initialized with the value of n (which is non-negative) and decreases by 1 whenever v2 < m.\n- v2: it starts from 0 and increases by 1 if v2 < m, otherwise it resets to 0.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body to find a ranking function involving the variables in the loop body:\nWe need to find expressions that decrease with every successive iteration of the loop and are positive while the loop is executing. We can use a lexicographic ranking function with two expressions.\n\n1. The first expression can be `v1`, as it is always non-negative and decreases by 1 whenever v2 < m.\n2. The second expression can be `m - v2`, as it is positive when v2 < m and decreases by 1 when v2 increases by 1. When v2 reaches m, it resets to 0, and the second expression becomes m again.\n\nThus, the lexicographic ranking function is (v1, m - v2), and it is a valid ranking function because:\n- v1 and m - v2 are both positive while the loop is executing.\n- v1 decreases whenever v2 < m, and if v1 remains the same, m - v2 decreases (since v2 increases).\n\nHere's the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant v1;\n    loop variant m - v2;\n*/\n```",

Since `m` is a constant and greater than 0, `m - v2` is guaranteed to decrease whenever `v1` does not.",

The loop continues as long as `v1 > 0`. Inside the loop, we have two cases:\n1. If `v2 < m`, then `v2` increases by 1 and `v1` decreases by 1.\n2. If `v2 >= m`, then `v2` is reset to 0.\n\nWe can use a lexicographic ranking function with two expressions, `v1` and `m - v2`. In every iteration of the loop, either `v1` decreases or `v2` increases, which means the value of `m - v2` decreases. Both expressions are positive while the loop is executing.\n\nThe ranking function can be represented as follows:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant v1;\n    loop variant m - v2;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because it guarantees that the loop must terminate. The value of `v1` keeps decreasing, and the value of `m - v2` also decreases when `v2` is reset to 0. This ensures that the loop cannot run indefinitely, as both expressions must be positive for the loop to continue executing.",

The loop condition is `v1 > 0`. Inside the loop, there are two branches:\n\n1. If `v2 < m`, then `v2` is incremented by 1 and `v1` is decremented by 1.\n2. If `v2 >= m`, then `v2` is reset to 0.\n\nThe ranking function should be a sequence of expressions (e1, e2) such that:\n\n1. Both e1 and e2 are positive while the loop is executing.\n2. Either e1 decreases or if e1 remains the same, then e2 decreases.\n\nBased on the loop behavior, we can choose the following ranking function:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant v1;\n    loop variant m - v2;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because:\n\n1. `v1` is always positive inside the loop (since the loop condition is `v1 > 0`).\n2. `m - v2` is positive while the loop is executing because `v2 < m` in the first branch and `v2 = 0` in the second branch.\n3. In every iteration, either `v1` decreases (in the first branch), or `v2` resets to 0, causing `m - v2` to increase (in the second branch). This ensures that the lexicographic ranking function (v1, m - v2) is decreasing with every iteration of the loop."
