If `a` is not equal to `b`, the program exits immediately without entering the loop. Therefore, we can assume that `a == b` when entering the loop.\n3. Variables `x` and `y` are also assigned non-deterministic integer values.\n4. The loop condition is `x >= 0 || y >= 0`. The loop continues to execute as long as at least one of `x` or `y` is non-negative.\n5. Inside the loop, `x` is decreased by `(a - b + 1)` and `y` is decreased by `(b - a + 1)` in each iteration.\n6. Since `a == b`, the updates inside the loop can be simplified as `x = x - 1` and `y = y - 1`.\n\nNow, let's find the loop invariants for the given ranking function `((x >= y ? x : y))`:\n\n1. Before the loop execution: Since `a == b`, we know that `(a - b + 1) == 1` and `(b - a + 1) == 1`. So the loop invariant would be:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant a == b;\n*/\n```\n\n2.

Since `x` and `y` both decrease by 1 in each iteration, the ranking function decreases as well. We also know that `x` and `y` are non-negative at the start of each iteration. Therefore, we have the following loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0 ==> \\at(x, LoopEntry) == x + 1;\n    loop invariant y >= 0 ==> \\at(y, LoopEntry) == y + 1;\n*/\n```\n\n3.

So the loop invariant would be:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x < 0 && y < 0;\n*/\n```\n\nThe complete set of loop invariants for the given program is:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant a == b;\n    loop invariant x >= 0 ==> \\at(x, LoopEntry) == x + 1;\n    loop invariant y >= 0 ==> \\at(y, LoopEntry) == y + 1;\n    loop invariant x < 0 && y < 0;\n*/\n```",
