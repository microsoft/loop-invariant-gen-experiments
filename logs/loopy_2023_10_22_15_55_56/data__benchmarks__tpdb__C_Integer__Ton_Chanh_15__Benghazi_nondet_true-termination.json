            "First, let's note the starting values or constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head:\n- x is an unknown integer\n- d1 is an unknown integer\n- d2 is an unknown integer\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body and find a ranking function involving the variables in the loop body:\n1. x is decreased by d1 in every iteration: x = x - d1\n2. d1 is updated with the value of d2 + 1: d1 = d2 + 1\n3. d2 is updated with the value of d1old + 1: d2 = d1old + 1\n4. The loop continues executing as long as x >= 0\n\nBased on these observations, we can use the ranking function `x + d1`. Let's now check if it's a valid ranking function:\n\n- The value of the expression must be positive for the loop to continue executing. Since x >= 0 and d1 is an integer, x + d1 will be positive.\n- The value of the expression must decrease with every successive iteration of the loop. In each iteration, x is decreased by d1, so the value of x + d1 will decrease.\n\nTherefore, the ranking function `x + d1` is a valid ranking function for the given loop.\n\nHere is the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x + d1;\n*/\n```",
            "1. At the start of the loop, we have the following constraints for the live variables:\n   - x >= 0\n   - d1, d2, and d1old are unknown integers (without any specific constraints)\n\n2.

We can now try to find a ranking function. Let's start with x as it is the loop condition variable. Since x is being decreased by d1 in every iteration, we can use x as the first part of our lexicographic ranking function.\n\n4. To find the second part of the lexicographic ranking function, let's analyze d1, d2, and d1old. We can see that d1 and d2 are updated in every iteration in a way that they swap their values while also being incremented by 1. This means that both d1 and d2 will always be positive and increasing in every iteration. We can use the minimum of d1 and d2 as the second part of our ranking function, as it will always be positive and can only decrease when x remains the same.\n\nSo, the ranking function for the loop in the given program is:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n    loop variant min(d1, d2);\n*/\n```",

Their initial values are unknown, but we know that `x >= 0` for the loop to execute.\n\n2. Analyze the loop body and find a ranking function involving the variables in the loop body.\n\nIn the loop body, we have the following updates:\n- `x` is updated to `x - d1`.\n- `d1` is updated to `d2 + 1`.\n- `d2` is updated to `d1old + 1`, where `d1old` is the old value of `d1`.\n\n3. Output the ranking function in one code block, in ACSL syntax.\n\nAfter analyzing the loop body, we can find a lexicographic ranking function involving `x`, `d1`, and `d2`. We have two expressions in the lexicographic ranking function: `x` and `d1 - d2`. The first expression, `x`, decreases with every iteration, and the second expression, `d1 - d2`, remains the same or decreases with every iteration.\n\nHere is the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```c\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n    loop variant d1 - d2;\n*/\n```",

Additionally, we know that `d1` must be non-negative for the loop to terminate. We can define a lexicographic ranking function using `x` and the sum of `d1` and `d2`:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n    loop variant d1 + d2;\n*/\n```\n\nThis is a valid lexicographic ranking function because:\n- `x` decreases in each iteration (`x = x - d1`), and it must be non-negative for the loop to execute (`x >= 0`).\n- The sum `d1 + d2` decreases in each iteration, as `d1` gets replaced by `d2 + 1`, and `d2` gets replaced by the old value of `d1` plus 1.

This implies that `x` decreases by at least `d1` in every iteration.\n3. `\\at(d1, LoopEntry) == \\at(d2, LoopEntry) + 1`: This invariant ensures that the initial value of `d1` is always one greater than the initial value of `d2`. This is important because the values of `d1` and `d2` are swapped and incremented in the loop body.\n4. `d1 >= 1`: This invariant ensures that `d1` is always greater than or equal to 1. This is important because it guarantees that `x` decreases in every iteration.",
