The loop condition is `x > 0 && x < 100 && x >= 2*oldx + 10`. In each iteration, `oldx` is updated to the current value of `x`, and `x` is then assigned a new value from `unknown_int()`. We cannot predict the exact value of `x` in each iteration, but we know that it must be greater than or equal to `2*oldx + 10` and less than 100.\n\nConsidering the constraints on `x` and the loop condition, we can create a ranking function based on the upper bound of `x` and the value of `oldx` in each iteration.\n\nThe ranking function is:\n```\n100 - x\n```\n\nNow let's explain why this is a valid ranking function:\n\n1. The value of the ranking function is positive while the loop is executing, as `x < 100` in the loop condition.\n2. The ranking function is decreasing with every iteration of the loop because, in each iteration, `x` is updated to a value greater than or equal to `2*oldx + 10`, which means that the value of `100 - x` will be smaller than the previous value of `100 - oldx`.\n\nNow let's write the ranking function in the ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant 100 - x;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function proves that the loop must terminate, as its value is always positive during the loop execution and decreases with every iteration.",

Since `x` must be less than 100 for the loop to continue executing, we can use `100 - x` as our first expression, which decreases with each iteration (as `x` must increase) and is positive while the loop is executing.\n\nExpression 2: Another constraint given by the loop condition is that `x >= 2 * oldx + 10`. Therefore, we can use `x - 2 * oldx - 10` as our second expression, which must be non-negative while the loop is executing.

Similarly, `oldx` is uninitialized, so it contains a garbage value.\n\nNext, let's analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition and the given ranking function. The loop condition is `x > 0 && x < 100 && x >= 2*oldx + 10`. The given ranking function is `(100 - x, x - 2 * oldx - 10)`.\n\nNow, let's output the loop invariants that are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination, such that the loop invariants imply that the ranking function decreases with every iteration:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= x <= 100;\n    loop invariant 0 <= oldx <= 100;\n    loop invariant x >= 2 * oldx + 10 ==> \\at(x, LoopEntry) > x;\n    loop invariant x >= 2 * oldx + 10 ==> \\at(oldx, LoopEntry) < oldx;\n*/\n```",
