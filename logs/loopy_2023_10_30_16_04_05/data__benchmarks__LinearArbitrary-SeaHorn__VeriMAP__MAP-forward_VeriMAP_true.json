The first if-else statement increments `a` and `b` based on the result of `unknown_int()`. The second if-else statement increments `a` and `b` based on the negation of the result of `unknown_int()`.\n\nNow, let's identify the loop invariants. A loop invariant is a condition that is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nBased on the analysis of the loop body, we can identify the following loop invariants:\n\n1. `i >= 0`: This invariant is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n2. `a >= 0`: This invariant is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n3. `b >= 0`: This invariant is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n4. `a + b <= 3*n`: This invariant is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nTo output the loop invariants in ACSL annotations, we can use the following code block:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant i >= 0;\n    loop invariant a >= 0;\n    loop invariant b >= 0;\n    loop invariant a + b <= 3*n;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have not used any variables or functions that are not declared in the program, and we have not made any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given. We have also not used any keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops."
