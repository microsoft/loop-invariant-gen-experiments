The loop only increments `i` until it reaches `N`, and `x` is not modified at all. Since the post-condition only checks the value of `x`, which remains 0, we can simplify the loop invariants:\n\n```c\n/*@ \n  loop invariant 0 <= i;\n  loop invariant i <= N;\n  loop invariant x == 0;\n*/\n```\n\nHowever, the verifier still reports \"Unknown\" and \"Partially proven\" statuses for some invariants. This is because the variable `N` is never assigned a value, and thus it contains a garbage value. To make the verifier able to prove the invariants and post-condition, we need to initialize `N` properly. For example, you can assign it a non-negative value:\n\n```c\n  N = NONDET;\n  assume(N >= 0);\n```\n\nNow, with the proper initialization of `N`, the loop invariants mentioned above should be sufficient for Frama-C to verify the post-condition:\n\n```c\n/*@ \n  loop invariant 0 <= i;\n  loop invariant i <= N;\n  loop invariant x == 0;\n*/\n```"

The input to Frama-C is a C program file with ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations.\nFor the given program, find the necessary loop invariants of the while loop to help Frama-C verify the post-condition.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. \n- Output loop invariants that are true \n(i) before the loop execution, \n(ii) in every iteration of the loop and \n(iii) after the loop termination, \nsuch that the loop invariants imply the post condition.\n- If a loop invariant is a conjunction, split it into its parts.\n- Output all the loop invariants in one code block. For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values. Do not use variables that have garbage values.**\n- **Do not use keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops.**\n- **Variables that are not explicitly initialized, could have garbage values. Do not make any assumptions about such values.**\n- **Do not use the \\at(x, Pre) notation for any variable x.**\n- **Do not use non-deterministic function calls.**\n"
