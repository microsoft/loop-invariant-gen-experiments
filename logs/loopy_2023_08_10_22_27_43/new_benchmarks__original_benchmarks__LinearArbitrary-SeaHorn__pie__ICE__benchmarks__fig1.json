Before the loop execution:\n   - `x` is initialized to `-50`, so `x <= 0` holds.\n   - `y` has a garbage value, but since the loop condition is `x < 0`, we know that `y` must be non-negative for the loop to terminate. So, `y >= 0` holds.\n\n2. In every iteration of the loop:\n   - Since `x` is updated to `x + y`, and `y` is non-negative, `x` will never be greater than 0 during the loop. Thus, `x <= 0` holds.\n   - `y` is incremented by `1` in each iteration, so it remains non-negative. Thus, `y >= 0` holds.\n\n3. After the loop termination:\n   - When the loop terminates, `x >= 0`. Since `x` is updated to `x + y` in the last iteration, we know that `y` must be positive for `x` to become non-negative. Thus, the post-condition `y > 0` holds."
