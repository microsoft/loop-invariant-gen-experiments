Loop invariant `(x - 5) % 8 == 0` is established but not preserved.\n   - This invariant is true before the loop since `(5 - 5) % 8 == 0`.\n   - To make it preserved, we need to ensure that it remains true after each loop iteration.\n   - Since `x` is incremented by 8 in each iteration, `(x - 5) % 8` will still be 0, as `(x + 8 - 5) % 8 == (x - 5) % 8`.\n\n3. Loop invariant `x % 8 == 5` is partially proven to be inductive.\n   - This invariant is true before the loop since `5 % 8 == 5`.\n   - It is preserved because `x` is incremented by 8 in each iteration, and `(x + 8) % 8 == x % 8`.\n\nSo, the fixed loop invariants are:\n\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant x >= 5;\n  loop invariant (x - 5) % 8 == 0;\n  loop invariant x % 8 == 5;\n*/\n```"
