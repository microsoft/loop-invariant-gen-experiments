We also know that `f1` and `f2` are always less than or equal to `g1` and `g2`, respectively, so we can keep the invariants `i12` and `i13`. We can also see that `f2` is always equal to `f1 + 1`, and `g2` is always equal to `g1 + 1`, so we can keep the invariants `i14` and `i30`.\n\nThe key relationship between `h1`, `h2`, `f1`, and `g1` is given by the loop invariant `i9`, which states that `h2 == h1 + f1`.
