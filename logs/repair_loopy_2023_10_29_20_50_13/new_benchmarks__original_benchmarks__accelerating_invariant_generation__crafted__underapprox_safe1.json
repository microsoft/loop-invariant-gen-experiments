This means the invariant is established. However, during the loop execution, when `x` reaches 6, the invariant does not hold because `y` will be equal to `1 << 6 = 64`, which is divisible by 3.\n\nTo fix the invariant, we need to make sure it is preserved during the loop execution. We can achieve this by modifying the invariant to hold for all values of `x` in the loop, not just when `x >= 6`. The updated invariant should express that `y` is equal to `1 << x`, as this is true at every step of the loop execution.
