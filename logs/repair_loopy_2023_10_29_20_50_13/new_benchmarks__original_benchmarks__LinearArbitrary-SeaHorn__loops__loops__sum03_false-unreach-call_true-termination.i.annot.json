It's true before the loop starts because `sn` is initialized to 0. It's preserved since `sn` only increases or stays the same during the loop iterations.\n\n2. x >= 0: This invariant is partially proven to be inductive. It's true before the loop starts because `x` is initialized to 0. It's preserved since `x` only increases during the loop iterations.\n\n3. x <= 10 ==> sn == x * 2: This invariant is partially proven to be inductive. It's true before the loop starts because when `x` is 0, `sn` is also 0. It's preserved because when `x` is less than 10, `sn` is updated to be `sn + 2`, which maintains the relationship `sn == x * 2`.\n\n4. x > 10 ==> sn == 10 * 2: This invariant is partially proven to be inductive.

It's preserved because when `x` is greater than 10, `sn` does not change.\n\n5. 0 <= sn <= 20: This invariant is partially proven to be inductive. It's true before the loop starts because `sn` is initialized to 0. It's preserved since `sn` only increases or stays the same during the loop iterations, and it never goes above 20 due to the conditions in the loop body.\n\nThe issue seems to be with the assertion that is not proven. To address this issue, we can strengthen the existing invariants by adding a new invariant that captures the relationship between `x` and `sn` more precisely. We can add the following invariant:\n\n6. sn == x * 2 || (x > 10 && sn == 20)\n\nThis invariant states that either `sn` is equal to `x * 2` or `x` is greater than 10 and `sn` is equal to 20.

But some of the other invariants are not inductive.\nIf an invariant is established, it means that the verifier is able to prove that the invariant holds before the loop.\nIf an invariant is preserved, it means that the verifier is able to prove that the invariant holds after the loop, assuming that it holds before the loop.\n\nTo fix the non-inductive invariants, try the following:\nIf an invariant is partially proven to be inductive, make sure it is actually inductive. If it is not, remove it or replace it with a different inductive invariant. If it is, then fix the other non-inductive invariants.\nIf an invariant is preserved but not established, add a clause to the invariant to make it established (a clause that makes the invariant hold before the loop begins).\nIf an invariant is established but not preserved, add a clause to the invariant to make it preserved (a clause that makes the invariant hold after the loop ends, assuming that it holds before the loop begins).\nIf an invariant is neither established nor preserved, remove it or replace it with a different inductive invariant.\n\nIf none of the above is possible, add a new loop invariant to strengthen the existing invariants.\n\nPlease fix all the above-mentioned errors, and provide the corrected loop invariants for the program that are sufficient to verify the assertions in the program.\nUse the ACSL syntax to specify the invariants. Output only one code block in the end, with the fixed invariants. **Do not output any other code blocks**.\nLet's think step by step."

                    "First, let's analyze the loop and its conditions. The loop is infinite, but there is a condition `x<10` inside the loop. The variable `sn` is incremented by 2 only when `x<10`. After `x` reaches 10, `sn` remains constant. So, we need to consider this behavior when fixing the invariants.\n\nNow let's fix the invariants based on the feedback from Frama-C:\n\n1. `sn >= 0` is partially proven to be inductive. We don't need to change it as it's true before the loop, during the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\n2. `x <= loop1` is established but not preserved. We don't need the variable `loop1` in the invariant. Instead, we can use `x <= 10` which is always true before the loop, during the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\n3. `x <= 10 ==> sn == x * 2` is established but not preserved. We need to modify it to account for the fact that `sn` remains constant after `x` reaches 10. We can use `x <= 10 ? sn == x * 2 : sn == 20`.\n\n4. `0 <= sn <= 20` is partially proven to be inductive.
