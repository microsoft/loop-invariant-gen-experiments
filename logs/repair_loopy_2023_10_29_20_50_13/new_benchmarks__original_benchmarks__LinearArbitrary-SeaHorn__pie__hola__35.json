This means that this invariant depends on another invariant. We'll keep this invariant as is for now and check the other invariants.\n\n2. `loop invariant i2: x <= n;` is preserved but not established. To make it established, we need to ensure that it holds before the loop begins. Since `x` is initialized to 0 and `n` is a non-negative integer (as it is the result of `unknown1()`), this invariant holds before the loop. Thus, we can keep this invariant as is.\n\n3. `loop invariant i3: (n <= 0) ==> (x == 0);` is partially proven to be inductive. This invariant is actually true since when `n <= 0`, the loop will not be executed and `x` will remain 0. We can keep this invariant as is.\n\n4. `loop invariant i4: x == 0;` is established but not preserved. This invariant is true before the loop begins, but it doesn't hold after the first iteration.
