The maximum value for x after the loop can be 100 when y is even, so the correct upper bound for x is 100.\n\nNow, let's analyze the other invariants. The invariants i2 and i3 handle the cases when y is even and odd, respectively. Invariant i4 states that y does not change during the loop execution, which is correct. Invariant i5 is the one we need to establish, as it is the main assertion we want to prove after the loop.\n\nWe notice that invariant i5 is actually a conjunction of invariants i2 and i3. Therefore, we can remove i5 and split it into i2 and i3. Since i2 and i3 are partially proven to be inductive, we need to strengthen them by adding clauses that ensure they hold before the loop execution and after each loop iteration.\n\nWe can strengthen i2 by adding a clause that states that x is initially even when y is even:\n\n```\nloop invariant i2: (y % 2 == 0 && x == 0) || (y % 2 == 0 ==> x % 2 == 0);\n```\n\nWe can strengthen i3 by adding a clause that states that x is initially either 0 or 1 when y is odd:\n\n```\nloop invariant i3: (y % 2 != 0 && (x == 0 || x == 1)) || (y % 2 != 0 ==> (x % 2 == 1 || x == 0));\n```\n\nWith these changes, the corrected loop invariants are:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1: 0 <= x && x <= 100;\n    loop invariant i2: (y % 2 == 0 && x == 0) || (y % 2 == 0 ==> x % 2 == 0);\n    loop invariant i3: (y % 2 != 0 && (x == 0 || x == 1)) || (y % 2 != 0 ==> (x % 2 == 1 || x == 0));\n    loop invariant i4: \\at(y, LoopEntry) == y;\n*/\n```"
