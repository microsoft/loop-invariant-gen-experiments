To fix this, we can add a clause that makes the invariant hold before the loop begins, which is when `i = 1`.\n\n2. `0 <= j <= 10 && j == 11 - i` is established but not preserved. We need to add a clause that makes the invariant hold after the loop ends.

Since it's partially proven, we can keep it and focus on fixing the other invariants.\n\n4. `sn == 2 * (10 - j)` is established but not preserved. To make it preserved, we can add a clause that relates the change in `sn` to the change in `j`.

If it is not, remove it or replace it with a different inductive invariant. If it is, then fix the other non-inductive invariants.\nIf an invariant is preserved but not established, add a clause to the invariant to make it established (a clause that makes the invariant hold before the loop begins).\nIf an invariant is established but not preserved, add a clause to the invariant to make it preserved (a clause that makes the invariant hold after the loop ends, assuming that it holds before the loop begins).\nIf an invariant is neither established nor preserved, remove it or replace it with a different inductive invariant.\n\nIf none of the above is possible, add a new loop invariant to strengthen the existing invariants.\n\nPlease fix all the above-mentioned errors, and provide the corrected loop invariants for the program that are sufficient to verify the assertions in the program.\nUse the ACSL syntax to specify the invariants.
