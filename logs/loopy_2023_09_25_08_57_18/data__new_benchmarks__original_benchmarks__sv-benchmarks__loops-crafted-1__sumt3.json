Specifically, we need to show that the loop invariants are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nBefore the loop execution, the loop invariants are true because `i`, `j`, `k`, and `l` are all initialized to 0. In every iteration of the loop, the loop invariants are preserved because the loop body only increments `i`, `j`, or `k` by 1, depending on the value of `l`. After the loop termination, the loop invariants are still true because the loop body does not modify `i`, `j`, or `k`.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the loop invariants imply the post-condition, and we can use Frama-C to verify the post-condition. The necessary loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i == 0;\n    loop invariant j == 0;\n    loop invariant k == 0;\n    loop invariant l == 0;\n*/\n```"
