Before the loop execution:\n\t* `i = 0` (from the initialization statement `i=0;`)\n\t* `n = 10` (from the initialization statement `n=10;`)\n2. In every iteration of the loop:\n\t* `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration\n\t* `n` remains constant\n3. After the loop termination:\n\t* `i` is equal to `n` (from the loop condition `i < n`)\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the while loop in the given program are:\n\n1. `i = 0`\n2. `n = 10`\n3. `i <= n` (from the loop condition `i < n`)\n\nNote that the loop invariants are written in the form of ACSL annotations, which are supported by Frama-C.",
