Therefore, `x` will always be less than 100 in each iteration.\n\n(iii) After the loop termination, we can say that `x` is greater than or equal to 100. This is because the loop condition is `x < 100`, and the loop will terminate when `x` becomes greater than or equal to 100.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the while loop in the given C program are:\n\n* `x < 100` before the loop execution.\n* `x < 100` in every iteration of the loop.\n* `x >= 100` after the loop termination.\n\nThese loop invariants imply the post-condition `y <= 0 || (y < 0 && x >= 100)`, which is the desired property to be verified by Frama-C."
