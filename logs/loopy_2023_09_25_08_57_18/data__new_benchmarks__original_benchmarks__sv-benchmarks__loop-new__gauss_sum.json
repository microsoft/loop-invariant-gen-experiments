In every iteration of the loop, `sum` is equal to the sum of all the values of `i` from 1 to the current iteration. This is because the loop body updates `sum` by adding `i` to it in each iteration.\n3. After the loop termination, `sum` is equal to the sum of all the values of `i` from 1 to `n`. This is because the loop condition is `i <= n`, which means that the loop will terminate when `i` becomes greater than `n`.\n\nTo express these loop invariants in ACSL annotations, we can use the following code block:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant sum == 0;\n    loop invariant sum == (1 + 2 + ... + i);\n    loop invariant sum == (1 + 2 + ... + n);\n*/\n```\nIn this code block, we have defined three loop invariants:\n\n1. `sum == 0`: This invariant is true before the loop execution, as `sum` is initialized to 0.\n2. `sum == (1 + 2 + ... + i)`: This invariant is true in every iteration of the loop, as `sum` is updated by adding `i` to it in each iteration.\n3. `sum == (1 + 2 + ... + n)`: This invariant is true after the loop termination, as the loop condition is `i <= n`, which means that the loop will terminate when `i` becomes greater than `n`.\n\nNote that we have used the `==` operator to express the loop invariants, as this operator is used to compare the values of variables in ACSL. Also, we have used the `+` operator to represent the sum of the values of `i` from 1 to `n`, as this is the expression that we want to verify using the loop invariants."
