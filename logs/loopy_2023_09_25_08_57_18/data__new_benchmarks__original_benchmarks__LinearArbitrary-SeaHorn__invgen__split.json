If `b` is true, `i` is incremented.\n2. If `b` is false, `j` is incremented.\n\nAfter each iteration, `b` is flipped (i.e., `b` becomes `!b`).\n\nLoop Condition:\nThe loop condition is `n < 2*k`.\n\nPre-condition:\nBefore the loop starts, the following variables are assigned:\n\n* `k` is assigned the value 100.\n* `b` is assigned the value 0.\n* `i` and `j` are assigned the value 0.\n* `n` is assigned the value 0.\n\nPost-condition:\nAfter the loop terminates, the following property must be satisfied:\n\n* `i` is equal to `j`.\n\nLoop Invariants:\nTo verify the post-condition, we need to find loop invariants that are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\n1.

This invariant is true before the loop execution, as `i` and `j` are initialized to 0, and `n` is initialized to 0. After each iteration, `n` is incremented by 1, and either `i` or `j` is incremented by 1, depending on the value of `b`. Therefore, `i + j` is equal to `n` in every iteration of the loop.\n3. After the loop termination:\n\nThe loop invariant `i == j` is still true after the loop termination, as `i` and `j` are equal to each other in every iteration of the loop.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the while loop in the given program are:\n\n* `i == j` before the loop execution\n* `i + j == n` in every iteration of the loop\n* `i == j` after the loop termination\n\nThese loop invariants imply the post-condition `i == j`, which is the desired property that we want to verify.",
            "ERROR: Output does not contain at least 1 code block\nOutput:\n To find the loop invariants for the given program, we need to analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. The loop condition is `n < 2*k`, where `k` is a constant value `100` and `n` is the loop variable.\n\nThe loop body contains two if-else statements. The first if-else statement is `if(b) { i++; } else { j++; }`. The second if-else statement is `b = !b;`.\n\nLet's assume that the loop invariants are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. Based on this assumption, we can derive the following loop invariants:\n\n1. `i + j <= 2*k`: This invariant is true before the loop execution, as `i` and `j` are initialized to `0`. In every iteration of the loop, the if-else statement increments either `i` or `j` by `1`, so the sum of `i` and `j` is always less than or equal to `2*k`. After the loop termination, the loop invariant is still true, as the loop has terminated and `i` and `j` have not been modified.\n2. `b = !b`: This invariant is true before the loop execution, as `b` is initialized to `0`. In every iteration of the loop, the if-else statement toggles the value of `b` between `0` and `1`. After the loop termination, the loop invariant is still true, as the loop has terminated and `b` has not been modified.\n\nBased on these loop invariants, we can conclude that the post-condition `i == j` is true after the loop termination. This is because the loop invariants imply that `i` and `j` are both equal to `k`, which is the same value as `i` and `j` are initialized to.\n\nTherefore, the necessary loop invariants for the while loop to help Frama-C verify the post-condition `i == j` are:\n\n1. `i + j <= 2*k`\n2. `b = !b`",
