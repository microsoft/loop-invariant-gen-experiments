The loop body consists of two statements:\n\n* `x++`\n* `y++`\n\nWe can see that the loop body does not modify the value of `y`, so the loop invariant for `y` is simply `y == x`.\n\nFinally, we analyze the loop condition. The loop condition is `unknown_bool()`, which returns a Boolean value. We don't know the value of `unknown_bool()` before the loop starts, so we can't say anything about the loop invariant for the loop condition.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the loop in the program are:\n\n* `y == x` (invariant for `y`)\n* `unknown_bool()` (invariant for the loop condition)\n\nNote that we have not used any variables or functions that are not declared in the program, and we have not made any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given. We have also avoided using any keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops.",
