In this case, the post-condition is `sn == SIZE*a || sn == 0`.\n\nWe can use the loop invariants to prove the post-condition. For example, if `sn == 0`, then the loop invariants `sn >= 0` and `sn <= SIZE*a` are still true after the loop termination. Therefore, we can conclude that the post-condition `sn == SIZE*a || sn == 0` is true.\n\nHere are the loop invariants that we can use to prove the post-condition:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i >= 1;\n    loop invariant sn >= 0;\n    loop invariant sn <= SIZE*a;\n    loop invariant i <= SIZE;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used the loop invariants `sn >= 0` and `sn <= SIZE*a` to prove the post-condition `sn == SIZE*a || sn == 0`. These loop invariants are necessary to ensure that the post-condition is true after the loop termination."
