The loop body increments the variable `y` by the value of `x`.\n\nTo find the necessary loop invariants, we need to analyze the loop body and the loop condition.\n\n1. Before the loop execution:\nThe pre-condition is `y >= 0`, which implies that `y` is non-negative.\n2. In every iteration of the loop:\nThe loop body increments `y` by `x`, so the loop invariant `y >= 0` is maintained.\n3. After the loop termination:\nThe loop terminates when `y < 0`, so the loop invariant `y >= 0` is not satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the necessary loop invariants for the loop in the program above are:\n\n* `y >= 0` (before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop)\n* `y < 0` (after the loop termination)\n\nNote that these loop invariants are sufficient to imply the post-condition `0 == 1`, which is always false. Therefore, the program is correct.",

The loop body is `y = y + x;`. This assignment statement updates the value of `y` to the sum of `y` and `x`.\n2. The loop condition is `y >= 0`.
