Loop Invariant (After Loop Termination):\nAfter the loop is terminated, the following conditions are true:\n* `i` is greater than or equal to 0 (since the loop condition is `i<100` and the loop body updates `i` with `i=i+1`, which is always non-negative)\n* `c` is greater than or equal to 0 (since it is initialized to `unknown_int()` and the loop body updates it with `c=c+i`, which is always non-negative)\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the loop in the program are:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant i>=0;\n    loop invariant c>=0;\n    loop invariant i<=100;\n    loop invariant c+i>=0;\n*/\n```\nThese loop invariants imply the post-condition `c>=0`, since `c` is initialized to `unknown_int()` and the loop body updates it with `c=c+i`, which is always non-negative."
