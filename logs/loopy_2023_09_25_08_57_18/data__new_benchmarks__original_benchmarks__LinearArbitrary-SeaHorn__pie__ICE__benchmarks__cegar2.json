In every iteration of the loop, we need to ensure that `x` is less than `N`. This is already ensured by the loop condition `x < N`.\n3. After the loop termination, we need to ensure that `m` is between 0 and `N-1`, inclusive. We can do this by adding a post-condition to the loop:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant (0 <= m) && (m < N); @*/\n```\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the while loop in the program are:\n\n* `N > 0` before the loop execution.\n* `x < N` in every iteration of the loop.\n* `(0 <= m) && (m < N)` after the loop termination.\n\nNote that we have used the ACSL annotations to specify the loop invariants. These annotations are used by Frama-C to verify the properties of the program."
