The variable `n` is not modified because it is a constant, and the variable `y` is not modified because it is only assigned a value at the beginning of the loop.\n\nThe variables that are modified within the loop body are `x` and `y`. The variable `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, and the variable `y` is incremented by 1 if `x > y`.\n\nTo find the loop invariants, we need to express the conditions that must be true before the loop execution, during each iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nHere are the loop invariants for the loop in the program:\n```scss\n/*@\n    loop invariant x >= 0 && x <= y && y < n;\n    loop invariant x >= 0 && x <= y && y <= n;\n    loop invariant x >= 0 && x <= y;\n*/\n```\nThe first loop invariant states that `x >= 0` and `x <= y` before the loop execution. This is true because `x` is initialized to a value between 0 and `y` at the beginning of the loop.\n\nThe second loop invariant states that `x >= 0` and `x <= y` during each iteration of the loop. This is true because `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, and `x` is always less than or equal to `y`.\n\nThe third loop invariant states that `x >= 0` and `x <= y` after the loop termination. This is true because `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, and `x` is always less than or equal to `y`.\n\nThe loop invariants imply the post-condition `y == n` because `y` is incremented by 1 in each iteration if `x > y`, and `x` is always less than or equal to `y`. Therefore, if `y` is equal to `n` before the loop execution, it will still be equal to `n` after the loop termination."

The loop condition is `x<n`. This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as `x` is less than `n`.\n\nNext, let's analyze the loop body. The loop body contains two statements: `x++;` and `if (x>y) y++;`. The first statement increments `x` by 1, and the second statement increments `y` by 1 if `x` is greater than `y`.\n\nNow, let's identify the loop invariants. A loop invariant is a condition that remains true before, during, and after each iteration of the loop. In this case, we can identify two loop invariants:\n\n1. `x <= y`: This invariant is true before the loop starts, as `x` is initialized to a value between 0 and `y`. It is also true in every iteration of the loop, as `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, and `y` is only incremented if `x` is greater than `y`. Finally, this invariant is also true after the loop terminates, as `x` will eventually be equal to `n`, and `y` will be equal to `n` if `x` is greater than `y`.\n2. `y <= n`: This invariant is true before the loop starts, as `y` is initialized to a value between 0 and `n`. It is also true in every iteration of the loop, as `y` is only incremented if `x` is greater than `y`. Finally, this invariant is also true after the loop terminates, as `y` will eventually be equal to `n`.\n\nSo, the loop invariants for the while loop in the given program are `x <= y` and `y <= n`. These loop invariants can be used to verify the post-condition of the program, which is `y==n`.",
