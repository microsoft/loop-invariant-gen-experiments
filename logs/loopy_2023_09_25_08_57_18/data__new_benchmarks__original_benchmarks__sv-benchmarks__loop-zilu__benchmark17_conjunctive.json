This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.\n\nNow, let's think about what we want the loop invariants to imply about the post-condition. The post-condition is `k>=n`, so we want the loop invariants to ensure that `k` is always greater than or equal to `n` after each iteration of the loop.\n\nHere are some possible loop invariants that imply the post-condition:\n\n1. `i <= n`: This invariant ensures that the loop will terminate when `i` is equal to `n`, which is necessary for the post-condition to hold.\n2. `k >= i`: This invariant ensures that `k` is always greater than or equal to `i`, which implies that `k` is greater than or equal to `n` after the loop terminates.\n\nTo summarize, the loop invariants for this program are:\n```\n/*@\n  loop invariant i <= n;\n  loop invariant k >= i;\n*/\n```\nThese loop invariants ensure that the post-condition `k>=n` is true after the loop terminates."
