This is because the loop condition `i<N` is checked in every iteration, and the loop continues to execute as long as this condition is true.\n3. After the loop termination, the variable `i` must be equal to the constant `N`. This is because the loop continues to execute until the condition `i<N` becomes false, which means that `i` must be equal to `N` after the loop terminates.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the loop in the given program are:\n\n* Before the loop execution, `i = 0`.\n* In every iteration of the loop, `i < N`.\n* After the loop termination, `i = N`.\n\nNote that these loop invariants are necessary conditions for the loop to execute correctly. If any of these invariants is violated, the loop may not execute correctly or may not terminate at all.",

            "ERROR: Output does not contain at least 1 code block\nOutput:\n To find the loop invariants for the while loop in the program, we need to analyze the loop body and the loop condition.\n\nLoop Body:\nThe loop body consists of a single statement: `i++`. This statement increments the value of `i` by 1 in each iteration.\n\nLoop Condition:\nThe loop condition is `i < N`. This condition checks whether the value of `i` is less than `N`. If the condition is true, the loop continues to execute. If the condition is false, the loop terminates.\n\nLoop Invariants:\n\n1. Before the loop execution, `i` is equal to 0. This is the initial value of `i` and is therefore a loop invariant.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, `i` is incremented by 1. This means that in each iteration, `i` is equal to the previous value of `i` plus 1. Therefore, `i` is a loop invariant in every iteration.\n3. After the loop termination, `i` is equal to `N`. This is because the loop continues to execute until `i` is equal to `N`. Once `i` is equal to `N`, the loop terminates and `i` is equal to `N`.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the while loop in the program are:\n\n* `i = 0` before the loop execution\n* `i = i + 1` in every iteration of the loop\n* `i = N` after the loop termination\n\nNote that these loop invariants imply the post-condition `i > N`, which is the desired property to be verified by Frama-C.",
