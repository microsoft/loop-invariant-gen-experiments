The loop variable is `x`, and it is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.\n\nNext, let's analyze the loop body. The loop body consists of two statements:\n\n1. `m = unknown_int();`: This statement assigns a new value to the variable `m` each time the loop is executed. The value of `m` is determined by the function `unknown_int()`, which is not defined in the program. Therefore, we cannot make any assumptions about the value of `m`.\n2. `x = x + 1;`: This statement increments the value of `x` by 1 each time the loop is executed.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop condition. The loop condition is `x < 100`. This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as the value of `x` is less than 100.\n\nFinally, let's identify the loop invariants. A loop invariant is a condition that is true before the loop starts, remains true in every iteration of the loop, and is still true after the loop terminates.
