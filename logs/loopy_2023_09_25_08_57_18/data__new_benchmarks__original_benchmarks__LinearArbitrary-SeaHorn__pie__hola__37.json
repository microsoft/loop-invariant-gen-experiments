Before the loop execution: `x < n`\n2. In every iteration of the loop: `x < n`\n3. After the loop termination: `x >= n`\n\nThese loop invariants can be written in ACSL annotations as follows:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x < n;\n    loop invariant x < n;\n    loop invariant x >= n;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used the `loop invariant` keyword to indicate that the condition is true before, during, and after the loop execution. The `;` at the end of each invariant is optional, but it makes the code more readable.\n\nAlso, note that we have not used any variables or functions that are not declared in the program. We have also not made any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given, as per the instructions."

Before the loop execution, m is equal to 0, and n is equal to unknown1(). Since m is initialized to 0, it is less than or equal to n.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, if the condition unknown2() is true, the value of m is assigned to x. Since x is less than or equal to n, m is also less than or equal to n.\n3.
