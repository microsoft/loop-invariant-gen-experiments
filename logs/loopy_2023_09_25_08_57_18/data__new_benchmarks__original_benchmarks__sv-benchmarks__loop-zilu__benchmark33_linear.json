To find the loop invariants for the loop in the program, we need to analyze the loop body and the loop condition.\n\nFirst, let's make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.

We have:\n\n* `x++;`: This increments `x` by 1.\n* `while (x<100 && x>=0) { ... }`: This is the loop condition. It checks if `x` is less than 100 and greater than or equal to 0.

It's also true in every iteration of the loop, because `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
