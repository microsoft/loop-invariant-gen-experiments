This statement increments the value of `i` by 1 in each iteration of the loop.\n\nLoop Condition:\nThe loop condition is `i < n`. This condition checks if the value of `i` is less than the value of `n`. If the condition is true, the loop continues to execute. Otherwise, the loop terminates.\n\nLoop Invariants:\n\n1. Before the loop execution, the value of `i` is 0, and the value of `n` is 10.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, the value of `i` is incremented by 1.\n3. After the loop termination, the value of `i` is equal to 10.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants are:\n\n* `i = 0` before the loop execution\n* `i < n` in every iteration of the loop\n* `i = n` after the loop termination\n\nNote that these loop invariants imply the post-condition `!
