We can split them into their parts and output them separately.\n\nOutput:\n```\n/*@\n  loop invariant x <= 6;\n  loop invariant y == 2^x;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have not used any variables or functions that are not declared in the program, and we have not made any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.
