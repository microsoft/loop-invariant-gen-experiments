After the loop termination, `res` is equal to `a + b`.\n\nHere is the code block that specifies the loop invariants:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant 0 <= cnt;\n    loop invariant cnt >= 0;\n    loop invariant res == a + b;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used the `loop invariant` keyword to specify the loop invariants. The `0 <= cnt` and `cnt >= 0` invariants ensure that the loop continues to execute as long as `cnt` is greater than or equal to 0. The `res == a + b` invariant ensures that `res` is equal to `a + b` after the loop termination."

                "content": " Sure, I can help you with that!\n\nFirst, let's identify the loop in the program. The loop is the `while` loop that starts on line 11 and ends on line 15.\n\nNext, let's identify the loop invariant. A loop invariant is a condition that is true before the loop starts, is true after each iteration of the loop, and is true after the loop ends. In this case, the loop invariant is `res == a + b`.\n\nNow, let's think about why this is the case. The loop invariant is true before the loop starts because `res` is initialized to `a` and `cnt` is initialized to `b`, so `res` is equal to `a + b`. The loop invariant is also true after each iteration of the loop because `cnt` is decremented by 1 each time through the loop, and `res` is incremented by 1 each time through the loop. Finally, the loop invariant is true after the loop ends because `cnt` is equal to 0, so the loop has terminated, and `res` is equal to `a + b`.\n\nHere's the loop invariant in ACSL syntax:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant res == a + b; */\n```\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."
