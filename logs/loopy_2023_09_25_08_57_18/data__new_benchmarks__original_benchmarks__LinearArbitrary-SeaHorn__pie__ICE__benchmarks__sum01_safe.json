Therefore, the value of `sn` will always be less than or equal to the value of `i`.\n\n3. After the loop termination:\n\nThe loop invariant that is true after the loop termination is `sn == n`. This is because the loop will terminate when the value of `i` is greater than `n`, and the value of `sn` will be equal to the value of `n` at that point.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the while loop in the program are:\n\n* `sn == 0` (before the loop execution)\n* `sn <= i` (in every iteration of the loop)\n* `sn == n` (after the loop termination)\n\nNote that these loop invariants are not necessarily the only loop invariants that are true for the loop, but they are the ones that are true in this particular case.",
