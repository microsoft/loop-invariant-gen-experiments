The third statement is `len--;`, which decrements the value of `len` by 1.\n\nThe loop invariants are the conditions that remain true before the loop, during each iteration of the loop, and after the loop. In this case, the loop invariants are:\n\n1. `i >= 0`: This is because `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop, and `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.\n2. `j >= 0`: This is because `j` is initialized to 0 before the loop, and `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.\n3. `len >= 0`: This is because `len` is initialized to `BASE_SZ` before the loop, and `len` is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.\n4. `i < BASE_SZ`: This is because `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop, and `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.\n5. `j < BASE_SZ`: This is because `j` is initialized to 0 before the loop, and `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.\n\nThese loop invariants imply that the loop will terminate when `len` reaches 0, because the loop condition `len == 0` will be satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the loop in the program are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i >= 0;\n    loop invariant j >= 0;\n    loop invariant len >= 0;\n    loop invariant i < BASE_SZ;\n    loop invariant j < BASE_SZ;\n*/\n```\nNote that these loop invariants do not include the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program, because they are not relevant to the loop invariants."
