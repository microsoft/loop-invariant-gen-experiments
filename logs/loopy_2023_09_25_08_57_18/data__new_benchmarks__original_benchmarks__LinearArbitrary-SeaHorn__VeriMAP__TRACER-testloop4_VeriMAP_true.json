Loop Body:\nThe loop body consists of a single statement: `x=x+1;`. This statement increments the value of `x` by 1.\n2. Loop Condition:\nThe loop condition is `x != N`. This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as `x` is not equal to `N`.\n3. Loop Invariants:\nA loop invariant is a condition that is true before the loop starts, remains true throughout the loop execution, and is still true after the loop terminates.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can identify the following loop invariants for the loop in the program:\n\n(i) Before the loop starts, `x` is equal to 0.\n\n(ii) In every iteration of the loop, `x` is incremented by 1.\n\n(iii) After the loop terminates, `x` is equal to `N`.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the loop in the program are:\n\n`x == 0`\n\n`x <= N`\n\n`x == N`\n\nNote that the first loop invariant is true before the loop starts, the second loop invariant is true in every iteration of the loop, and the third loop invariant is true after the loop terminates.",
