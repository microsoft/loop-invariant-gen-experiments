The loop condition is `1`, which means that the loop will execute indefinitely.\n\nNext, we need to find the loop invariants that are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nLet's start by finding the loop invariant that is true before the loop execution. Since the loop body increments `sn` by 1 in each iteration, we can say that `sn` is equal to `x*1` before the loop execution. Therefore, the loop invariant that is true before the loop execution is:\n```\nsn == x*1\n```\nNow, let's find the loop invariant that is true in every iteration of the loop. Since the loop body increments `sn` by 1 in each iteration, we can say that `sn` is equal to `x*1` in every iteration of the loop. Therefore, the loop invariant that is true in every iteration of the loop is:\n```\nsn == x*1\n```\nFinally, let's find the loop invariant that is true after the loop termination. Since the loop body increments `sn` by 1 in each iteration, and the loop condition is `1`, we can say that `sn` is equal to `x*1` after the loop termination. Therefore, the loop invariant that is true after the loop termination is:\n```\nsn == x*1\n```\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the while loop in the program are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant sn == x*1;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have only found one loop invariant in this case, which is `sn == x*1`. However, in general, there may be multiple loop invariants that can be used to verify a property in the program."

Pre-conditions:\nThe program defines two external functions `unknown()` and `unknown_uint()`, which are not defined in the given program. Therefore, we cannot make any assumptions about these functions.\n2. Loop body:\nThe loop body consists of two statements: `sn = sn + 1;` and `x++;`.\n3. Loop condition:\nThe loop condition is `1`, which means the loop will execute indefinitely.\n4. Post-condition:\nThe post-condition is not explicitly stated in the program, but we can infer it from the loop body. The post-condition is `sn == x * 1 || sn == 0`.\n\nNow, let's find the necessary loop invariants to verify the post-condition.\n\n1. Loop invariant before the loop execution:\nThere is no explicit loop invariant before the loop execution. However, we can assume that `sn == 0` and `x == 0` before the loop execution.\n2. Loop invariant in every iteration of the loop:\nThe loop invariant in every iteration of the loop is `sn == x * 1 || sn == 0`.\n3. Loop invariant after the loop termination:\nThere is no explicit loop invariant after the loop termination.
