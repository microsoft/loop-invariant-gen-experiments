The loop body consists of two statements:\n```\nc = c + i;\ni = i + 1;\n```\nThese statements update the values of `c` and `i` in each iteration of the loop.\n\nNow, let's think about the loop invariants. A loop invariant is a condition that remains true before, during, and after the loop execution. In other words, a loop invariant is a condition that is true before the loop starts, and it remains true in every iteration of the loop, and it is still true after the loop terminates.\n\nBased on the loop condition and the loop body, we can deduce the following loop invariants:\n\n1. `c >= 0`: This invariant is true before the loop starts, because `c` is initialized to 0. It remains true in every iteration of the loop, because `c` is only updated by adding a non-negative value (`i`) to it. And it is still true after the loop terminates, because `c` is not updated anymore.\n2. `i >= 0`: This invariant is true before the loop starts, because `i` is initialized to 0. It remains true in every iteration of the loop, because `i` is only updated by adding 1 to it. And it is still true after the loop terminates, because `i` is not updated anymore.\n3. `c + i >= 0`: This invariant is true before the loop starts, because `c` and `i` are both initialized to 0. It remains true in every iteration of the loop, because `c` and `i` are only updated by adding non-negative values to them.

The loop condition is `i < 1000`. This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as the variable `i` is less than 1000.\n\nNext, let's analyze the loop body. The loop body consists of two statements: `c = c + i;` and `i = i + 1;`. These statements update the values of the variables `c` and `i`, respectively.\n\nNow, let's find the loop invariants. A loop invariant is a condition that remains true before, during, and after the loop execution. To find the loop invariants, we need to identify the conditions that are true before the loop execution, during each iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nBased on the analysis of the loop body and the loop condition, we can identify the following loop invariants:\n\n1. `i >= 0` before the loop execution, as `i` is initialized to 0.\n2. `c >= 0` before the loop execution, as `c` is initialized to 0.\n3. `i < 1000` during each iteration of the loop, as the loop condition is `i < 1000`.\n4. `c >= 0` after the loop termination, as the loop body ensures that `c` is always greater than or equal to 0.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants of the while loop in the program are:\n\n* `i >= 0`\n* `c >= 0`\n* `i < 1000`\n* `c >= 0`\n\nThese loop invariants can be used to verify the post-condition of the program, which is `c>=0`.",

The loop body consists of two statements: `c = c + i` and `i = i + 1`.\n\nTo find the necessary loop invariants, we need to analyze the loop body and the loop condition. We can start by identifying the variables that are involved in the loop body and the loop condition. The variables are:\n\n* `i`: the loop variable, which is incremented by 1 in each iteration\n* `c`: the sum of the values of `i` in each iteration\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body. The first statement `c = c + i` can be rewritten as `c = c + i - i`, which is the same as `c = c`. This means that the value of `c` is not changed in the loop body. Therefore, we can conclude that `c` is a loop invariant, and its value is preserved across all iterations of the loop.\n\nThe second statement `i = i + 1` can be rewritten as `i = i + 1 - 1`, which is the same as `i = i`. This means that the value of `i` is also preserved across all iterations of the loop. Therefore, we can conclude that `i` is also a loop invariant.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop condition. The loop condition is `i < 1000`. This means that the loop will execute at most 1000 times. Therefore, we can conclude that the loop condition is also a loop invariant.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclude that the necessary loop invariants for the loop in the program are:\n\n* `c` is preserved across all iterations of the loop\n* `i` is preserved across all iterations of the loop\n* The loop condition `i < 1000` is preserved across all iterations of the loop\n\nThese loop invariants can be used to verify the post-condition of the program, which is `c >= 0`.",
