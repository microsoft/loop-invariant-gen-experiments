The loop body consists of a single statement: `sn = sn + a;`. This statement updates the value of `sn` by adding `a` to it.\n2. The loop condition is `i <= SIZE`. This condition checks whether the loop should continue executing or terminate.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can identify the following loop invariants:\n\n1. Before the loop execution, `sn` is equal to 0. This is because the loop initializes `sn` to 0 before starting the loop.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, `sn` is equal to `sn + a`. This is because the loop updates the value of `sn` by adding `a` to it in each iteration.\n3. After the loop termination, `sn` is equal to `SIZE * a` or 0. This is because the loop terminates when `i` is greater than `SIZE`, and the final value of `sn` is the sum of all the values of `a` from 1 to `SIZE`.\n\nTherefore, the necessary loop invariants for the loop in the given program are:\n\n* `sn == 0` before the loop execution\n* `sn == sn + a` in every iteration of the loop\n* `sn == SIZE * a || sn == 0` after the loop termination",
