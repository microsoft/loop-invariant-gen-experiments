They also imply the post-condition of the loop, which is `m >= 0 || n <= 0`.\n\nHere's the output in the required format:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant m >= 0 || n <= 0;\n    loop invariant m < n || n <= 0;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have not used any variables or functions that are not declared in the program, and we have not made any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given. We have also avoided using any keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops."
