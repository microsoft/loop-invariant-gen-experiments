Loop body:\nThe loop body consists of two parts:\n* If `y` is even, then `x` is incremented by 2.\n* If `y` is odd, then `x` is incremented by 1.\nWe can represent the loop body as:\n```scss\nif (y % 2 == 0) {\n  x += 2;\n} else {\n  x++;\n}\n```\n3. Loop condition:\nThe loop condition is that `x` is less than 99. We can represent this condition as `x < 99`.\n4. Post-condition:\nThe post-condition for the loop is that `x` is even. We can represent this post-condition as `(x % 2) == 0`.\n\nNow, let's find the loop invariants for the loop in the program.\n\n1. Loop invariant 1:\nThe first loop invariant is that `x` is less than or equal to 99. We can represent this invariant as `x <= 99`.\n2. Loop invariant 2:\nThe second loop invariant is that `y` is even. We can represent this invariant as `y % 2 == 0`.\n3. Loop invariant 3:\nThe third loop invariant is that `x` is even. We can represent this invariant as `(x % 2) == 0`.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the loop in the program are:\n```scss\n/*@ \n  loop invariant x <= 99;\n  loop invariant y % 2 == 0;\n  loop invariant (x % 2) == 0;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have not used any variables or functions that are not declared in the program, and we have not made any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given. Additionally, we have not used any keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops."

If `y` is even, it adds 2 to `x`. Otherwise, it increments `x` by 1.\n\nNow, let's think about the loop invariants. A loop invariant is a condition that remains true before, during, and after each iteration of the loop. In other words, a loop invariant is a condition that is preserved by the loop.\n\nBased on the loop body and the loop condition, we can deduce the following loop invariants:\n\n1. `x` is less than or equal to 99.\n2. `y` is either even or odd.\n3. If `y` is even, then `x` is even.\n4. If `y` is odd, then `x` is odd.\n\nThese loop invariants can be used to verify the post-condition of the loop, which is `x % 2 == y % 2`.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the while loop in the given program are:\n```scss\n/*@ loop invariant x <= 99;\n    loop invariant y % 2 == 0 || y % 2 == 1;\n    loop invariant x % 2 == y % 2;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used the `%` operator to check whether `x` and `y` are even or odd.
