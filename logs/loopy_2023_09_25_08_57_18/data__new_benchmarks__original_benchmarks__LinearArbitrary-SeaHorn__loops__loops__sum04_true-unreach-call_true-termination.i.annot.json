In every iteration of the loop:\n\nThe loop body updates the value of `sn` by 2 in each iteration. Therefore, the loop invariant `sn == 2*i` is true in every iteration of the loop.\n\n3. After the loop termination:\n\nThe loop terminates when the value of `i` becomes greater than 8. Therefore, the loop invariant `sn == 8*(2)` is true after the loop termination.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclude that the necessary loop invariants for the while loop in the program are:\n\n1. `sn == 0`\n2. `sn == 2*i`\n3. `sn == 8*(2)`\n\nHere is the ACSL annotation for the loop with these loop invariants:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant sn == 0;\n    loop invariant sn == 2*i;\n    loop invariant sn == 8*(2);\n@*/\n```\nNote that we have used the `@` symbol to indicate that the loop invariants are ACSL annotations. Also, we have used the `==` symbol to indicate that the loop invariants are true in every iteration of the loop."

The loop body consists of the statement `sn = sn + (2);`. This statement updates the value of `sn` by adding 2 to its current value.\n2. The loop condition is `i <= 8`. This condition checks whether the loop should continue executing or terminate.\n\nBased on the analysis above, we can identify the following loop invariants:\n\n1. Before the loop execution, `sn` is equal to 0. This is because the variable `sn` is initialized to 0 before the loop.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, `sn` is equal to the sum of the previous value of `sn` and 2. This is because the loop body updates the value of `sn` by adding 2 to its current value.\n3. After the loop termination, `sn` is equal to 8 times 2 or 0.
