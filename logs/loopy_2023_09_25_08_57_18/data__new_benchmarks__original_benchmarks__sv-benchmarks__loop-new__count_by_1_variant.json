Before the loop execution, `i` is less than or equal to `LARGE_INT`. This is because `i` is initialized to 0, and the loop condition is `i != LARGE_INT`, which means that `i` will not be incremented until it reaches `LARGE_INT`.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, `i` is less than or equal to `LARGE_INT`. This is because the loop body does not modify the value of `i`, and the loop condition is `i != LARGE_INT`, which means that `i` will not be incremented until it reaches `LARGE_INT`.\n3. After the loop termination, `i` is equal to `LARGE_INT`. This is because the loop will terminate when `i` reaches `LARGE_INT`, and the loop condition is `i != LARGE_INT`, which means that `i` will not be incremented until it reaches `LARGE_INT`.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the loop in the program above are:\n\n* `i <= LARGE_INT` before the loop execution\n* `i <= LARGE_INT` in every iteration of the loop\n* `i == LARGE_INT` after the loop termination\n\nNote that these loop invariants are not conjunctions, so we do not need to split them into their parts.",
