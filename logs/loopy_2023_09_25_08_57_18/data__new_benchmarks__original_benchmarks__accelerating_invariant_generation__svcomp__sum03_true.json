Before the loop execution:\nThe loop invariants hold because `sn` is initialized to 0, `x` is initialized to 0, and `sn` is equal to `x * a` or `sn` is equal to 0.\n2. In every iteration of the loop:\nThe loop invariants hold because `sn` is increased by `a` in each iteration, and `x` is increased by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, `sn` is still equal to `x * a` or `sn` is equal to 0.\n3. After the loop termination:\nThe loop invariants hold because the loop condition is always true, and the loop will continue to execute until the condition is false. Therefore, the loop invariants will hold after the loop termination.\n\nIn summary, the loop invariants for the while loop in the given program are:\n\n1. `sn` is initialized to 0 and remains 0 throughout the loop.\n2. `x` is initialized to 0 and increases by 1 in each iteration of the loop.\n3. `sn` is equal to `x * a` or `sn` is equal to 0.\n\nThese loop invariants imply the post-condition, which is that `sn` is equal to `x * a` or `sn` is equal to 0.",
