We cannot make any assumptions about the behavior of this function, so we cannot infer any loop invariants from it.\n\nBased on the loop body and the loop condition, we can state the following loop invariants:\n\n1. Before the loop execution, `x` and `y` have values that are not determined by the loop.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, `x` and `y` increase by 2.\n3. After the loop termination, `x` and `y` have values that are not determined by the loop.\n\nWe can express these loop invariants using ACSL annotations as follows:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0 && x <= 2;\n    loop invariant y >= 0 && y <= 2;\n*/\n```\nNote that we cannot infer any loop invariants from the `unknown()` function, so we cannot include any loop invariants related to `x` or `y` in the loop body."
