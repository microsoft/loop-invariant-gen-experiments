Loop Body: The loop body consists of a single statement: `x += 2;`. This statement increments the value of `x` by 2 in each iteration.\n2. Loop Condition: The loop condition is `x >= 10`. This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as `x` is greater than or equal to 10.\n\nNow, let's find the loop invariants:\n\n1. Before the loop execution, the variable `x` is initialized to 10. Therefore, the loop invariant `x == 10` is true before the loop execution.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, the value of `x` is incremented by 2. Therefore, the loop invariant `x % 2 == 0` is true in every iteration of the loop.\n3. After the loop termination, the value of `x` is not modified. Therefore, the loop invariant `x % 2 == 0` is still true after the loop termination.\n\nSo, the necessary loop invariants for the while loop are:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant x == 10;\n    loop invariant x % 2 == 0;\n*/\n```\nThese loop invariants imply the post-condition `!(x % 2)` because if `x % 2 == 0`, then `x` is even, and therefore, `!(x % 2)` is true."

Pre-condition:\nThe pre-condition for the loop is that the variable `x` is greater than or equal to 10. This can be expressed as `x >= 10`.\n2. Loop condition:\nThe loop condition is the expression that determines whether the loop should continue executing or terminate. In this case, the loop condition is `x >= 10`.\n3. Loop body:\nThe loop body is the code that is executed each time the loop iterates. In this case, the loop body is `x += 2;`. This statement increments the value of `x` by 2.\n4. Post-condition:\nThe post-condition is the condition that is true after the loop terminates. In this case, the post-condition is `x % 2 == 0`.\n\nNow, let's find the loop invariants that are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination, such that the loop invariants imply the post condition.\n\n1. Before the loop execution:\nThe variable `x` is initialized to 10, so the loop invariant `x >= 10` is true before the loop execution.\n2. In every iteration of the loop:\nThe loop body increments the value of `x` by 2, so the loop invariant `x >= 10` is still true in every iteration of the loop.\n3. After the loop termination:\nThe loop terminates when `x` is less than 10, so the loop invariant `x >= 10` is still true after the loop termination.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants that are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination are:\n\n* `x >= 10`\n\nNote that we have only one loop invariant, which is `x >= 10`. This loop invariant implies the post condition `x % 2 == 0`, since if `x` is greater than or equal to 10, then `x` is even, and the remainder of `x` divided by 2 is 0.",
