The fourth loop invariant `i4` states that `y` is never equal to `7` or `8` in the loop body. The fifth loop invariant `i5` states that `x` is never equal to `9` or `10` in the loop body. The sixth loop invariant `i6` states that `y` is never equal to `11` or `12` in the loop body. The seventh loop invariant `i7` states that `x` is never equal to `13` or `14` in the loop body. The eighth loop invariant `i8` states that `y` is never equal to `15` or `16` in the loop body. The ninth loop invariant `i9` states that `x` is never equal to `17` or `18` in the loop body. The tenth loop invariant `i10` states that `y` is never equal to `19` or `20` in the loop body.\n\nThese loop invariants imply that `y` is equal to `6` after the loop terminates, which is the desired post-condition.
