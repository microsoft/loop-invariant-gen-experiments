In every iteration of the loop, the loop invariant is true because the loop updates `x` and `y` based on the condition, and the condition ensures that `x` and `y` remain less than or equal to 4 and 2, respectively.\n6. After the loop termination, the loop invariant is still true because the loop may or may not execute, and the condition ensures that `x` and `y` remain less than or equal to 4 and 2, respectively.\n7. Therefore, the loop invariant `x >= 4 && y <= 2` implies the post-condition `x >= 4 && y <= 2`, and we can use this loop invariant to verify the post-condition using Frama-C.\n\nHere is the loop invariant in ACSL annotations for the while loop:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant x >= 4 && y <= 2;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used the `assume` keyword to assume that `unknown_int()` returns a non-deterministic value, which means that the loop may or may not execute depending on the value returned. We have also used the `goto ERROR` statement to handle the case where the post-condition is not satisfied."
