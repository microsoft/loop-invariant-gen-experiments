We can infer that the loop invariant `x + sn == 0` is always true before the loop starts, since the variables `x` and `sn` are initialized to 0.\n\nInside the loop, the loop invariant `x + sn == 0` is still true, since the loop body only updates the variables `x` and `sn` by adding 1 to their current values.\n\nAfter the loop terminates, the loop invariant `x + sn == 0` is still true, since the loop body does not modify the variables `x` and `sn` after the loop terminates.\n\nNow, let's consider the post-condition `sn == -1`.
