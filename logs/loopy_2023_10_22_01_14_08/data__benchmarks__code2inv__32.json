This statement decreases the value of `x` by 1 in each iteration.\n\nThe loop condition is `(x > 1)`. This condition checks if `x` is greater than 1, and if it is, the loop continues to execute.\n\nNow, let's think about the loop invariants. A loop invariant is a condition that is true before the loop execution, and remains true in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nIn this case, we can identify the following loop invariants:\n\n1. `x` is non-negative: Since `x` is initialized to `n`, which is non-negative, we can infer that `x` is also non-negative.\n2. `x` is less than or equal to `n`: This invariant follows from the loop condition, which checks if `x` is greater than 1. If `x` is greater than 1, then it must be less than or equal to `n`.\n3. `x` is less than or equal to `n - 1`: This invariant follows from the loop body, which decreases the value of `x` by 1 in each iteration.\n\nNow, let's combine these loop invariants into a single loop invariant using implication:\n\n`(x >= 0) && (x <= n) && (x <= n - 1) ==> (x == 1)`\n\nThis loop invariant states that if `x` is non-negative, less than or equal to `n`, and less than or equal to `n - 1`, then `x` must be equal to 1.\n\nNote that we are using implication instead of if-then to take care of the conditional nature of the code. We are also using conjunctions to bound the maximum and minimum values that `x` can take, and to express the relation between `x` and `n`.\n\nFinally, we can use the loop invariant to verify the post-condition of the program. The post-condition is `(x == 1)`, which states that `x` must be equal to 1 after the loop execution. We can use the loop invariant to prove that the post-condition holds, by showing that the loop invariant is true before the loop execution, and remains true in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.",
