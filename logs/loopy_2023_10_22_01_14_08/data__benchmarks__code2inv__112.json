We can use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code.\n\nFirst, we can add a conjunction to bound the maximum and minimum values that `i` can take. Since `i` is initialized to 1 and incremented by 1 in each iteration, it can take any value between 1 and `n`. So, we can add the conjunction `1 <= i <= n` to the loop invariant.\n\nNext, we can add a conjunction to bound the maximum and minimum values that `sn` can take. Since `sn` is initialized to 0 and incremented by 1 in each iteration, it can take any value between 0 and `n`. So, we can add the conjunction `0 <= sn <= n` to the loop invariant.\n\nWe can also add a conjunction to relate the variables `i` and `sn`. Since `sn` is initialized to 0 and incremented by 1 in each iteration, it is always equal to or larger than `i`. So, we can add the conjunction `i <= sn` to the loop invariant.\n\nFinally, we can add a conjunction to make the invariant trivially true at the beginning and end of the loop. Since `sn` is initialized to 0 and incremented by 1 in each iteration, it is always equal to 0 at the beginning of the loop. So, we can add the conjunction `sn == 0` to the loop invariant at the beginning of the loop. Similarly, since `sn` is equal to `n` at the end of the loop, we can add the conjunction `sn == n` to the loop invariant at the end of the loop.\n\nPutting it all together, we get the following loop invariants:\n```scss\n/*@\n    loop invariant 1 <= i <= n;\n    loop invariant 0 <= sn <= n;\n    loop invariant i <= sn;\n    loop invariant sn == 0;\n    loop invariant sn == n;\n*/\n```\nThese loop invariants imply the post-condition `sn == n`, which makes the assertion `sn == n` true."

A loop invariant is a property that is true before, during, and after each iteration of the loop. The loop invariants can be used to prove that the loop terminates and that the post-condition is satisfied.\n\nLet's start by identifying the loop invariants that are true before the loop execution. In this case, the only loop invariant that is true before the loop execution is `sn == 0`. This is because the variable `sn` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.\n\nNow, let's identify the loop invariants that are true in every iteration of the loop. The loop body consists of two assignments: `i = i + 1` and `sn = sn + 1`. The first assignment increments the variable `i` by 1, while the second assignment increments the variable `sn` by 1. Therefore, the loop invariants that are true in every iteration of the loop are `i >= 1` and `sn >= 1`.\n\nFinally, let's identify the loop invariants that are true after the loop termination. In this case, the only loop invariant that is true after the loop termination is `sn == n`. This is because the variable `sn` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, and the loop terminates when `i > n`. Therefore, `sn` must be equal to `n` after the loop terminates.\n\nNow, let's combine all the loop invariants that we have identified into a single loop invariant.
