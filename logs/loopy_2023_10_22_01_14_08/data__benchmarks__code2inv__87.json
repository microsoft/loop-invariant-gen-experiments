We need to ensure that the loop invariants are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nHere are the loop invariants for the loop in the program above:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant (lock == 1) ==> (x == y);\n    loop invariant (x == y) ==> (lock == 1);\n    loop invariant (x != y) ==> (lock == 1);\n    loop invariant (x != y) ==> (x == y);\n    loop invariant (y != x) ==> (y == x);\n    loop invariant (y != x) ==> (y == x);\n    loop invariant (x == y) ==> (y == x);\n    loop invariant (y == x) ==> (x == y);\n*/\n```\nThese loop invariants ensure that the loop condition `x != y` is always true, which implies that `lock == 1` is always true. Therefore, the post-condition `lock == 1` is verified.\n\nNote that we have used implication (==>) to take care of the conditional nature of the code. We have also added conjunctions that bound the maximum and minimum values that `x` and `y` can take, if such bounds exist. Finally, we have used implication to make the invariant trivially true at the beginning and end of the loop, if certain variables are non-deterministic."

The loop body consists of two branches: one for the case when `unknown()` returns `true`, and one for the case when `unknown()` returns `false`.\n\nIn the first branch, the loop invariant `lock  = 1` is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. This invariant is true because the loop invariant `lock  = 1` is true before the loop execution, and it is preserved in every iteration of the loop because the loop body does not modify the value of `lock`.\n\nIn the second branch, the loop invariant `lock  = 0` is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. This invariant is true because the loop invariant `lock  = 0` is true before the loop execution, and it is preserved in every iteration of the loop because the loop body does not modify the value of `lock`.\n\nNow, let's look at the loop condition. The loop condition is `(x != y)`. This condition is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. This condition is true because the loop invariant `x  = y` is true before the loop execution, and it is preserved in every iteration of the loop because the loop body does not modify the value of `x`.\n\nFinally, let's consider the post-condition of the loop, which is `(lock == 1)`. This post-condition is true after the loop termination, because the loop invariant `lock  = 1` is true before the loop execution, and it is preserved in every iteration of the loop.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclude that the necessary loop invariants for the while loop in the program above are:\n\n* `lock  = 1` before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination\n* `lock  = 0` before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination\n* `x  = y` before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination\n* `y  = (y + 1)` before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination\n\nThese loop invariants imply the post-condition `(lock == 1)`, which is the desired property of the loop.",

We can then use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code and add conjunctions that bound the maximum and minimum values that the variables can take, if such bounds exist.\n\nThe loop condition is `x != y`. The loop body contains two if-else statements, one for the case when `unknown()` returns true and the other when it returns false.\n\nIn the first if-statement, `lock` is set to 1 and `x` is set to `y`. In the second if-statement, `lock` is set to 0 and `x` is set to `y`, and `y` is set to `y + 1`.\n\nFrom the loop body, we can infer the following loop invariants:\n\n1. `lock` is either 0 or 1.\n2. `x` is either equal to `y` or `y + 1`.\n3. `y` is always equal to or larger than `x`.\n\nWe can also infer that the loop will terminate when `x` is equal to `y`, because the loop condition is `x != y`.\n\nSo, the loop invariants for the while loop in the given C program are:\n\n1. `lock == 0 \\/ lock == 1`\n2. `x == y \\/ x == y + 1`\n3. `y >= x`\n\nNote that we have used implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code and added conjunctions to bound the maximum and minimum values that the variables can take.

The loop body consists of two branches: one for the case when `unknown()` returns `true`, and one for the case when `unknown()` returns `false`.\n\nIn the first branch, the loop invariant `lock  = 1` is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. This invariant is true because the loop invariant `lock  = 1` is true before the loop execution, and it is preserved in every iteration of the loop because the loop body does not modify the value of `lock`.\n\nIn the second branch, the loop invariant `lock  = 0` is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. This invariant is true because the loop invariant `lock  = 0` is true before the loop execution, and it is preserved in every iteration of the loop because the loop body does not modify the value of `lock`.\n\nNow, let's look at the loop condition. The loop condition is `(x != y)`. This condition is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. This condition is true because the loop invariant `x  = y` is true before the loop execution, and it is preserved in every iteration of the loop because the loop body does not modify the value of `x`.\n\nFinally, let's consider the post-condition of the loop, which is `(lock == 1)`. This post-condition is true after the loop termination, because the loop invariant `lock  = 1` is true before the loop execution, and it is preserved in every iteration of the loop.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclude that the necessary loop invariants for the while loop in the program above are:\n\n* `lock  = 1` before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination\n* `lock  = 0` before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination\n* `x  = y` before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination\n* `y  = (y + 1)` before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination\n\nThese loop invariants imply the post-condition `(lock == 1)`, which is the desired property of the loop.",
