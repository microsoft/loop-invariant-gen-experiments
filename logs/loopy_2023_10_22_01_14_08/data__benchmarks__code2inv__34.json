This means that the loop will execute as long as `x` is greater than 0.\n\nThe loop body consists of a single statement: `(x = x - 1)`. This statement decreases the value of `x` by 1 in each iteration of the loop.\n\nNow, let's think about the loop invariants. We need to find conditions that are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. These conditions should imply the post-condition of the loop.\n\nHere are some loop invariants that we can use:\n\n1. `x >= 0` before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. This invariant ensures that `x` is always non-negative.\n2. `x == n` before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. This invariant ensures that `x` is always equal to `n`.\n3. `x >= 0` and `x == n` before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. This invariant ensures that `x` is always non-negative and equal to `n`.\n4. `x == 0` after the loop termination. This invariant ensures that the loop will terminate when `x` is 0.\n\nNow, let's add implications to take care of the conditional nature of the code. We can use the `==>` operator to represent implication.\n\nHere are the loop invariants with implications:\n\n1. `x >= 0 ==> x == n` before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. This invariant ensures that `x` is always non-negative and equal to `n`, if the loop executes at all.\n2. `x >= 0 ==> x == 0` after the loop termination. This invariant ensures that the loop will terminate when `x` is 0.\n\nFinally, we can use conjunctions to bound the maximum and minimum values that `x` can take, and to relate `x` to `n`.\n\nHere are the final loop invariants:\n\n1. `x >= 0 && x <= n` before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. This invariant ensures that `x` is always non-negative and less than or equal to `n`.\n2. `x == n ==> x == 0` after the loop termination. This invariant ensures that the loop will terminate when `x` is 0.\n\nNote that these loop invariants are sufficient to prove the post-condition of the loop, which is that `x` is equal to 0. However, we can also use other loop invariants, such as `x >= 0` and `x == n`, to prove the post-condition. The choice of loop invariants will depend on the specific requirements of the program and the properties that we want to verify.",
