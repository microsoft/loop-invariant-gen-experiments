This means that the loop will continue to execute until the function `unknown()` returns a value that is not 0.\n\nNow, let's find the loop invariants:\n\n1. Before the loop execution:\nWe can assume that `i` is initialized to 0, since the loop starts with `i = 0`.\n\n2. In every iteration of the loop:\nWe can assume that `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. This means that `i` will be equal to `i + 1` in each iteration.\n\n3. After the loop termination:\nWe can assume that the loop will terminate when the function `unknown()` returns a value that is not 0. This means that the loop will terminate when `i < y` is no longer true.\n\nNow, let's express these loop invariants in ACSL annotations:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i = 0;\n    loop invariant i = i + 1;\n    loop invariant i < y;\n    loop invariant i < x;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have added conjunctions to bound the maximum and minimum values that `i` can take. We have also added a conjunction to express the relation between `i` and `x`.\n\nFinally, we can use the implication operator (==>) to express the guard condition of the assertion:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i = 0;\n    loop invariant i = i + 1;\n    loop invariant i < y;\n    loop invariant i < x;\n    assert (i < x) ==> (i < y);\n*/\n```\nThis annotation tells Frama-C to verify that the assertion `(i < x) ==> (i < y)` is true after the loop termination. If the assertion is not true, Frama-C will report an error."
