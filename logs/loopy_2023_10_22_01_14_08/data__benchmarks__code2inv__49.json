Before the loop execution, we need to ensure that `c` is equal to `0` and `n` is greater than `0`. We can express this as:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant (c == 0 && n > 0);\n*/\n```\n2. In every iteration of the loop, we need to ensure that `c` is less than or equal to `n`. We can express this as:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant (c <= n);\n*/\n```\n3. After the loop termination, we need to ensure that `c` is not equal to `n`. We can express this as:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant (c != n);\n*/\n```\nTo take care of the conditional nature of the code, we can use implication to make the invariants trivially true when certain conditions are not met. For example, if `n <= -1`, then the loop invariant `c != n` is trivially true. We can express this as:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant (n <= -1 ==> c != n);\n*/\n```\nFinally, let's add conjunctions that bound the maximum and minimum values that the variables can take, and relations between variables. We can express these as:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant (c >= 0 && c <= n);\n    loop invariant (n > 0);\n    loop invariant (c <= n <==> c == n);\n*/\n```\nTherefore, the final loop invariants for the loop in the program above are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant (c == 0 && n > 0);\n    loop invariant (c <= n);\n    loop invariant (c != n);\n    loop invariant (n <= -1 ==> c != n);\n    loop invariant (c >= 0 && c <= n);\n    loop invariant (n > 0);\n    loop invariant (c <= n <==> c == n);\n*/\n```\nThese loop invariants can be used to verify the post-condition of the program using Frama-C."

We can start by making a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n\nPre-conditions:\n\n* n > 0\n* c = 0\n\nVariable assignments:\n\n* c = 0\n* c = c + 1\n* c = 1\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body.
