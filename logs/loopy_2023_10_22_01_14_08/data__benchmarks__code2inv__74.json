We will then use these notes to find the loop invariants that imply the post-condition.\n\nFirst, let's make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program. From the program, we can see that the pre-conditions are:\n\n* `c = 0`\n* `y >= 0`\n* `y >= 127`\n* `z = 36 * y`\n\nNext, let's analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. The loop condition is `unknown()`, which is a function call that we cannot assume anything about.\n\nNow, let's find the loop invariants that are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. We will use these loop invariants to imply the post-condition.\n\nFrom the loop body, we can see that the only statement that updates the value of `z` is `(z = z + 1)`. This statement is executed only when `c < 36`. Therefore, we can infer that `z` is equal to `36 * y` when `c >= 36`.\n\nWe can also see that the only statement that updates the value of `c` is `(c = c + 1)`. This statement is executed only when `c < 36`. Therefore, we can infer that `c` is equal to `36` when the loop terminates.\n\nNow, let's use these inferences to find the loop invariants that imply the post-condition. The post-condition is `(z >= 0)`. We can infer that the loop invariants are:\n\n* `z = 36 * y`\n* `c < 36`\n\nTherefore, the necessary loop invariants for the while loop in the given program are:\n\n* `z = 36 * y`\n* `c < 36`\n\nNote that we have used implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. We have also added conjunctions that bound the maximum and minimum values that `z` and `c` can take, if such bounds exist. We have also added a conjunction for the relation between `c` and `z`.\n\nFinally, we have used implication to make the invariants trivially true at the beginning and end of the loop, for the variables that are non-deterministic at those locations.",

We can also see that the loop is guarded by the condition `unknown()`, which means that the loop may not be executed at all.\n\nTo find the loop invariants, we need to identify the variables that are modified within the loop, as well as the conditions that are checked before each iteration. We can start by identifying the variables that are modified within the loop:\n\n* `c` is modified by adding 1 to its value in each iteration.\n* `z` is modified by adding 1 to its value in each iteration.\n\nNext, we can identify the conditions that are checked before each iteration:\n\n* The loop is guarded by the condition `unknown()`, which means that the loop may not be executed at all.\n* The loop condition is `c < 36`, which means that the loop will continue to execute until `c` is greater than or equal to 36.\n\nNow, we can start to identify the loop invariants. A loop invariant is a property that is true before the loop execution, at the beginning of each iteration, and after the loop termination. In this case, we can identify the following loop invariants:\n\n* The variable `c` is less than or equal to 36 before the loop execution, at the beginning of each iteration, and after the loop termination.\n* The variable `z` is greater than or equal to 0 before the loop execution, at the beginning of each iteration, and after the loop termination.\n* The variable `y` is greater than or equal to 0 before the loop execution, at the beginning of each iteration, and after the loop termination.\n* The variable `y` is greater than or equal to 127 before the loop execution, at the beginning of each iteration, and after the loop termination.\n\nTo make the loop invariants more specific, we can add conjunctions that bound the maximum and minimum values that the variables can take. For example, we can add the following conjunctions:\n\n* `c <= 36`\n* `z >= 0`\n* `y >= 0`\n* `y >= 127`\n\nFinally, we can use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. We can use the implication `==>` instead of using `if-then` to make the loop invariants more specific. For example, we can use the following loop invariants:\n\n* `c <= 36 ==> z >= 0`\n* `c <= 36 ==> y >= 0`\n* `c <= 36 ==> y >= 127`\n\nThese loop invariants are true before the loop execution, at the beginning of each iteration, and after the loop termination, and they imply the post-condition that `z >= 0`.",
