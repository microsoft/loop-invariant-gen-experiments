The loop condition is `i <= n`.\n\nNow, let's analyze the post-condition.

They also imply the post-condition of the program.\n\nHowever, we need to make sure that the loop invariants are not violated during the loop execution. We can do this by adding conjunctions that bound the maximum and minimum values that the variables can take. For example:\n```scss\n//@ loop invariant i >= 1 && i <= n;\n//@ loop invariant sn >= 0 && sn <= n;\n```\nThese conjunctions ensure that the variables `i` and `sn` do not exceed their maximum and minimum values during the loop execution.\n\nWe can also add conjunctions that express the relationship between the variables. For example:\n```scss\n//@ loop invariant i <= n && sn <= n;\n```\nThis conjunction expresses the fact that the variable `sn` is always equal to or smaller than the variable `n`.\n\nFinally, we can use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. We can use implication instead of using if-then statements. For example:\n```scss\n//@ loop invariant (i >= 1 && i <= n) ==> (sn >= 0 && sn <= n);\n```\nThis implication ensures that the loop invariant is true only if the condition `i >= 1 && i <= n` is true.\n\nIn summary, the necessary loop invariants for the while loop in the program above are:\n```scss\n//@ loop invariant i >= 1 && i <= n;\n//@ loop invariant sn >= 0 && sn <= n;\n//@ loop invariant (i >= 1 && i <= n) ==> (sn >= 0 && sn <= n);\n```\nThese loop invariants are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.

The loop body consists of two statements:\n\n* `i = i + 1`\n* `sn = sn + 1`\n\nFrom the loop body, we can infer the following loop invariants:\n\n* `i` is always less than or equal to `n`\n* `sn` is always greater than or equal to `i`\n\nWe can also infer the following additional loop invariants:\n\n* `i` is always greater than or equal to 1\n* `sn` is always greater than or equal to 1\n* `i` is always less than or equal to `n`\n\nNow, we need to check if the loop invariants imply the post-condition. The post-condition is:\n\n* `sn == n`\n\nWe can see that the loop invariants do not imply the post-condition directly. However, we can use the loop invariants to infer the post-condition.\n\nWe can use the following implication to infer the post-condition:\n\n* `sn == n` if `i == n`\n\nThis implication is valid because if `i` is equal to `n`, then `sn` must be equal to `n`.\n\nTherefore, the necessary loop invariants for the while loop in the given program are:\n\n* `i` is always less than or equal to `n`\n* `sn` is always greater than or equal to `i`\n* `i` is always greater than or equal to 1\n* `sn` is always greater than or equal to 1\n* `i` is always less than or equal to `n`\n* `sn == n` if `i == n`\n\nNote that we have used implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code.
