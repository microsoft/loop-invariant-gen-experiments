We have the following pre-conditions:\n\n* `x = 0`\n* `m = 0`\n* `n` is a non-deterministic variable, but we know that it is less than or equal to `x`\n\nNext, let's analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. The loop condition is `x < n`. The loop body consists of two statements:\n\n* `if (unknown()) { m = x; }`\n* `x = x + 1;`\n\nFrom the loop body, we can see that `m` is assigned a value of `x` if `unknown()` returns true. Otherwise, `m` remains unchanged. We also know that `x` is incremented by 1 in every iteration of the loop.\n\nNow, let's think about the loop invariants that we need to prove the post-condition. We want to prove that `m < n` after the loop termination. To do this, we need to show that `m` is less than `n` in every iteration of the loop, and that `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop.\n\nHere are the loop invariants that we need to prove:\n\n* `m <= n` before the loop execution\n* `m <= n` in every iteration of the loop\n* `n` is unchanged throughout the loop\n\nWe can represent these loop invariants using ACSL annotations:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant m <= n;\n    loop invariant m <= n;\n    loop invariant n;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used the `m <= n` invariant twice, once before the loop execution and once in every iteration of the loop. This is because we want to show that `m` is less than or equal to `n` in both cases.\n\nAlso, note that we have not used any variables or functions that are not declared in the program. We have also not made any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given, and we have not used any keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops.\n\nFinally, we have not used the `\\at(x, Pre)` notation for any variable, and we have not used non-deterministic function calls."

The first statement is a conditional statement that assigns `m` to `x` if `unknown()` returns true. The second statement increments `x` by 1.\n\nNow, let's find the loop invariants:\n\n1. Before the loop execution, we have `x = 0` and `m = 0`.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, we have `x < n`, which means that `m` is less than `n`.\n3. After the loop termination, we have `m < n`, which is the post-condition.\n\nSo, the loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant m >= 0;\n    loop invariant x < n ==> m < n;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used implication (`==>`) instead of `if-then` to take care of the conditional nature of the code. Also, we have added conjunctions to bound the maximum and minimum values that `x` and `m` can take. Finally, we have used the loop condition in the implication to make the invariant trivially true at the beginning of the loop."

In every iteration of the loop, `m` is either equal to `x` or `m` is equal to `x` plus 1. This is because if `unknown()` returns true, `m` is assigned the value of `x`, otherwise, `m` retains its previous value.\n3. After the loop termination, `m` is less than or equal to `n`.
