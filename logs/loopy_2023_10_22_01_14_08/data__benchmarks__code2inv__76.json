The loop body increments the `c` variable and sets the `z` variable to the sum of `z` and `c`. The loop invariant should be such that the loop terminates with `c >= 36` and `z >= 4608`.\n\nHere are the necessary loop invariants for the given program:\n\n1. `c >= 0`\n2. `c < 36`\n3. `z >= 0`\n4. `z < 4608`\n5. `c + z <= 4608`\n6. `c + z >= 0`\n7. `c + z == 36 * y`\n\nThe first four invariants are straightforward and are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. The fifth and sixth invariants are implications of the first four invariants and are used to ensure that the loop terminates with `c >= 36` and `z >= 4608`. The seventh invariant is a conjunction of the first four invariants and is used to ensure that the loop terminates with `c + z == 36 * y`.\n\nNote that the `assume()` function is used to make assumptions about the values of the variables before the loop execution. These assumptions are necessary to ensure that the loop terminates with the desired properties. The `unknown()` function is also used to make the loop non-deterministic, which is necessary to ensure that the loop terminates with the desired properties.",

Pre-conditions and variable assignments:\nThe program starts by assigning the value 0 to the variable c. It then assumes that the variable y is greater than or equal to 0 and greater than or equal to 127. It also assigns the value 36 times y to the variable z.\n2. Loop body:\nThe loop body consists of two if statements. The first if statement checks if the variable c is less than 36, and if so, it increments the variable c by 1 and increments the variable z by 1. The second if statement checks if the variable z is less than 0 or greater than or equal to 4608, and if so, it asserts that the variable c is greater than or equal to 36.\n3. Loop invariants:\nTo find the loop invariants, we need to identify the properties that are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. We can start by identifying the properties that are true before the loop execution.\n\na. Before the loop execution:\nWe know that the variable c is initialized to 0, and the variable z is initialized to 36 times y. Since y is assumed to be greater than or equal to 0 and greater than or equal to 127, we can infer that z is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 4608.\n\nb. In every iteration of the loop:\nIn every iteration of the loop, the variable c is incremented by 1 if the variable c is less than 36. This means that the variable c is always less than or equal to 36. The variable z is also incremented by 1 if the variable c is less than 36. This means that the variable z is always greater than or equal to the value of z at the beginning of the loop, and less than or equal to 4608.\n\nc. After the loop termination:\nAfter the loop termination, we know that the variable c is greater than or equal to 36, since the loop exits when the variable c is greater than or equal to 36. We also know that the variable z is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 4608, since the loop exits when the variable z is less than 0 or greater than or equal to 4608.\n\nd. Implication:\nWe can use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. For example, we can use the implication (c < 36 ==> z < 4608) to express the relationship between the variables c and z.\n\ne. Conjunctions:\nWe can add conjunctions that bound the maximum and minimum values that the variables c and z can take. For example, we can add the conjunction (c >= 0 && c <= 36) to bound the value of c, and (z >= 0 && z <= 4608) to bound the value of z.\n\nf. Relations:\nWe can add conjunctions for the relations between the variables c and z. For example, we can add the conjunction (c < z) to express the relationship between the variables c and z.\n\ng. Non-deterministic variables:\nWe can use implication to make the invariant trivially true at the beginning or end of the loop for non-deterministic variables. For example, we can use the implication (c == 0 ==> c < 36) to make the invariant trivially true at the beginning of the loop for the variable c.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can identify the following loop invariants:\n\n/*@\nloop invariant (c >= 0 && c <= 36);\nloop invariant (z >= 0 && z <= 4608);\nloop invariant (c < 36 ==> z < 4608);\nloop invariant (c < z);\n@*/\n\nThese loop invariants can help Frama-C verify the post-condition of the program, which asserts that the variable c is greater than or equal to 36.",
