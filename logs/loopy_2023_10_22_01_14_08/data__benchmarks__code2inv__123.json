The loop condition is `(i <= size)`. This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `size`.\n\nNext, we need to analyze the loop body. The loop body consists of two statements:\n```scss\n(i = i + 1);\n(sn = sn + 1);\n```\nThese statements increment `i` and `sn` by 1 in each iteration of the loop.\n\nNow, we need to determine the loop invariants. A loop invariant is a condition that is true before the loop executes, is true in every iteration of the loop, and is true after the loop terminates.\n\nTo find the loop invariants, we need to consider the pre-conditions and post-conditions of the loop. The pre-conditions are the conditions that are true before the loop executes. The post-conditions are the conditions that are true after the loop terminates.\n\nIn this case, the pre-conditions are:\n```scss\ni = 1;\nsize = 0;\n```\nThe post-conditions are:\n```scss\nsn = size;\n```\nWe can use these conditions to determine the loop invariants. For example, we can use the pre-conditions to determine that `i` is equal to 1 before the loop executes, and we can use the post-conditions to determine that `sn` is equal to `size` after the loop terminates.\n\nHere are the loop invariants that we can use to verify the post-condition:\n```scss\n/*@\n    loop invariant i == 1;\n    loop invariant sn == size;\n*/\n```\nThese loop invariants are true before the loop executes, are true in every iteration of the loop, and are true after the loop terminates. They imply the post-condition that `sn` is equal to `size`.\n\nNote that we have used the `==` operator to compare the values of `i` and `sn` to the pre-conditions and post-conditions. This is because we are trying to verify the post-condition that `sn` is equal to `size`, and the `==` operator is the appropriate way to compare these values.\n\nAlso note that we have used the `loop invariant` keyword to indicate that these conditions are loop invariants. This is the standard way to specify loop invariants in ACSL annotations."

Therefore, we can infer that the loop invariant for the loop condition is `i <= size`.\n\nIn the loop body, we can see that `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, and `sn` is incremented by 1 if `i` is less than or equal to `size`.

This is because the loop conditions and the loop termination condition are not explicitly stated in the program, but can be inferred from the loop body and the loop condition.\n\nAlso, note that we have used the `if` keyword to represent the implication between the loop conditions and the loop termination condition.
