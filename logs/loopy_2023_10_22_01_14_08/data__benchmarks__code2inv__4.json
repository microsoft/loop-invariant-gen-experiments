The loop body consists of two statements:\n```scss\nx += 1;\nif(z <= y) {\n    y = z;\n}\n```\nFrom the loop body, we can identify the following invariants:\n\n1. `x` is always equal to or smaller than `500`. This is because the loop condition is `x < 500`, and `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.\n2. `y` is always equal to or smaller than `z`. This is because the loop body sets `y` to `z` if `z` is less than or equal to `y`.\n3. `z` is always equal to or smaller than `y`. This is because the loop body sets `z` to `y` if `z` is less than or equal to `y`.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop condition. The loop condition is `x < 500`. This means that the loop will terminate when `x` is equal to or greater than `500`.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can identify the following loop invariants:\n\n1. `x` is always equal to or smaller than `500`.\n2. `y` is always equal to or smaller than `z`.\n3. `z` is always equal to or smaller than `y`.\n4. The loop will terminate when `x` is equal to or greater than `500`.\n\nTo express these invariants in ACSL, we can use the following annotations:\n```scss\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x <= 500;\n    loop invariant y <= z;\n    loop invariant z <= y;\n    loop invariant x >= 500 ==> false;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used the `==>` notation to indicate that the loop invariant is true if and only if the condition `x >= 500` is false. This is because the loop will terminate when `x` is equal to or greater than `500`.\n\nFinally, we can use the `assert` keyword to verify that the post-condition `z >= y` is true after the loop terminates. We can do this by adding the following annotation:\n```scss\n/*@ \n    assert z >= y;\n*/\n```\nThis annotation will verify that the post-condition `z >= y` is true after the loop terminates. If the post-condition is not satisfied, the verification process will fail."

The variables are `x`, `y`, and `z`.\n\nNext, we can analyze the loop body to identify the loop invariants. The loop body contains two statements, and we need to find the loop invariants for each statement.\n\nFor the first statement `x += 1`, the loop invariant is `x >= 0` and `x < 500`. This is because the loop condition is `x < 500`, and the loop body increments `x` by 1. Therefore, `x` can never be negative, and it can never exceed 500.\n\nFor the second statement `y = z` if `z <= y`, the loop invariant is `y >= z` and `y < 500`.

The overall loop invariant is `x >= 0` and `x < 500` and `y >= z` and `y < 500`.\n\nFinally, we can use the loop invariant to prove the post-condition `z >= y`. The post-condition is true because the loop invariant guarantees that `y >= z` and `y < 500`. Therefore, `z >= y` is true.\n\nHere is the output in ACSL notation:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0 && x < 500;\n    loop invariant y >= z && y < 500;\n*/\n```"
