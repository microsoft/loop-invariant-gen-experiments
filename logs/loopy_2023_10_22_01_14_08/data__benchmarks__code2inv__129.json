This is because the loop condition is `x < y`, which implies that `x` is greater than or equal to `y` after the loop terminates.\n\nNow, let's express these loop invariants in ACSL notation:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant (x <= y);\n    loop invariant (x <= y);\n    loop invariant (x >= y);\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used the `<=` and `>=` operators to bound the values of `x` and `y`. These operators are used to express the relationships between `x` and `y`, and are necessary to ensure that the loop invariants are true before, during, and after the loop execution.\n\nAlso, note that we have used the `loop invariant` keyword to indicate that these are loop invariants, and not just any ordinary conditions. This keyword is necessary to distinguish loop invariants from other conditions in the program.\n\nFinally, let's add conjunctions to bound the maximum and minimum values of `x` and `y`. We can do this by adding the following conjunctions to the loop invariants:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant (x <= y) && (x >= 0) && (y >= 0);\n    loop invariant (x <= y) && (x >= 0) && (y >= 0);\n    loop invariant (x >= y) && (x >= 0) && (y >= 0);\n*/\n```\nThese conjunctions ensure that the values of `x` and `y` are bounded by 0 and `y`, which is necessary to ensure that the loop invariants are true before, during, and after the loop execution.\n\nNow, let's use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. We can do this by adding the following implications to the loop invariants:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant (x <= y) ==> (x <= y) && (x >= 0) && (y >= 0);\n    loop invariant (x <= y) ==> (x <= y) && (x >= 0) && (y >= 0);\n    loop invariant (x >= y) ==> (x >= y) && (x >= 0) && (y >= 0);\n*/\n```\nThese implications ensure that the loop invariants are true only if the loop condition is true. This is necessary to ensure that the loop invariants are true before, during, and after the loop execution, even if the loop condition is not satisfied.\n\nFinally, let's add a conjunction to express the relationship between `x` and `y`.
