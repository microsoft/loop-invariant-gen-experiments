The loop body consists of a single statement, which assigns the value of x to (x - 1). This means that the value of x is decremented by 1 in every iteration of the loop.\n\nNext, let's analyze the loop condition. The loop condition is (x > 1). This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as the value of x is greater than 1.\n\nNow, let's find the necessary loop invariants. A loop invariant is a condition that is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. In this case, we need to find loop invariants that imply the post-condition, which is (x == 1).\n\nOne possible loop invariant is (x >= 1). This invariant is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. This is because the value of x is always greater than or equal to 1, and the loop condition is (x > 1), which means that the value of x will never be less than 1.\n\nAnother possible loop invariant is (x <= n). This invariant is also true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. This is because the value of x is always less than or equal to the value of n, and the loop condition is (x > 1), which means that the value of x will never be greater than the value of n.\n\nFinally, we can use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. We can add an implication that the loop invariant is true only if the condition (n >= 0) is true. This means that the loop invariant is only true if the value of n is greater than or equal to 0.\n\nHere is the code block that contains the loop invariants:\n```\n/*@\n  loop invariant (x >= 1);\n  loop invariant (x <= n);\n  loop invariant (n >= 0) ==> (x == 1);\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used the implication notation (==>) to take care of the conditional nature of the code.
