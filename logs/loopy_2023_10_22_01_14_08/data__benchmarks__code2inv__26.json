We can start by making a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n\nPre-conditions:\n\n* `n` is a variable of type `int` and is not initialized.\n* `x` is a variable of type `int` and is not initialized.\n\nVariable assignments:\n\n* `x` is assigned the value of `n` before the loop.\n* `x` is assigned the value of `x - 1` in the loop body.\n\nNext, we can analyze the loop condition. The loop condition is `x > 1`. This means that the loop will continue executing as long as `x` is greater than 1.\n\nNow, we can start finding the loop invariants. A loop invariant is a condition that is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. We can find the loop invariants by analyzing the loop body and the loop condition.\n\nLoop invariants:\n\n* Before the loop execution: `n` is a variable of type `int` and is not initialized.\n* In every iteration of the loop: `x` is a variable of type `int` and is assigned the value of `x - 1` in the loop body.\n* After the loop termination: `x` is a variable of type `int` and is equal to `n` before the loop.\n\nWe can also add conjunctions that bound the maximum and minimum values that `x` can take. Since `x` is assigned the value of `n` before the loop, and `n` is not initialized, we can assume that `x` can take any value. Therefore, we can add the following conjunction:\n\n* `x` can take any value between `INT_MIN` and `INT_MAX`.\n\nWe can also add a conjunction for the relation between `x` and `n`. Since `x` is assigned the value of `n` before the loop, we can add the following conjunction:\n\n* `x` is always equal to or smaller than `n`.\n\nFinally, we can use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. We can add the following implication:\n\n* If `x` is not equal to 1, then `n` is less than 0.\n\nThe loop invariants for the while loop in the given program are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x is a variable of type int and is not initialized;\n    loop invariant x is a variable of type int and is assigned the value of x - 1 in the loop body;\n    loop invariant x is a variable of type int and is equal to n before the loop;\n    loop invariant x can take any value between INT_MIN and INT_MAX;\n    loop invariant x is always equal to or smaller than n;\n    loop invariant if x is not equal to 1, then n is less than 0;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used the `INT_MIN` and `INT_MAX` constants to bound the maximum and minimum values that `x` can take.

The program starts by initializing the variable `n` to some value, which is not specified in the program. However, we can assume that `n` is a non-negative integer, as it is used as the upper bound for the loop.\n\nNext, let's analyze the loop body. The loop body consists of a single statement that assigns the value of `x` to `x - 1`. This statement is executed repeatedly as long as the condition `x > 1` is true.\n\nNow, let's consider the loop condition. The loop condition is `x > 1`, which means that the loop will terminate when `x` becomes less than or equal to 1.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can identify the following loop invariants:\n\n1. Before the loop execution, the variable `x` must be greater than or equal to 1. This is because the loop condition is `x > 1`, which means that the loop will not execute if `x` is less than or equal to 1.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, the variable `x` must be greater than or equal to 1.

After the loop termination, the variable `x` must be less than or equal to 1. This is because the loop condition is `x > 1`, which means that the loop will terminate when `x` becomes less than or equal to 1.\n\nWe can now use these loop invariants to verify the post-condition of the program. The post-condition is that the variable `n` is less than or equal to 0. We can use the loop invariants to prove that this post-condition is true.\n\nFirst, we can use the first loop invariant to prove that `x` is greater than or equal to 1 before the loop execution. This means that `n` is also greater than or equal to 1, as `n` is initialized to `x`.\n\nNext, we can use the second loop invariant to prove that `x` is greater than or equal to 1 in every iteration of the loop. This means that `n` is also greater than or equal to 1 in every iteration of the loop.\n\nFinally, we can use the third loop invariant to prove that `x` is less than or equal to 1 after the loop termination. This means that `n` is also less than or equal to 1 after the loop termination.\n\nTherefore, we have proven that the post-condition of the program is true, which means that the loop invariants are sufficient to verify the post-condition.\n\nHere is the code block with the loop invariants:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n    loop invariant i3;\n*/\n```\nIn this code block, `i1` is the first loop invariant, `i2` is the second loop invariant, and `i3` is the third loop invariant.
