Before the loop execution, `i` is initialized to 1 and `sn` is initialized to 0.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, `i` is incremented by 1 and `sn` is incremented by the value of the array element at the current index.\n3. After the loop termination, `sn` is equal to the number of non-zero elements in the array.\n\nTo express these invariants in ACSL, we can use the following annotations:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant i == 1;\n    loop invariant sn == 0;\n    loop invariant i <= size;\n    loop invariant sn <= size;\n    loop invariant i == sn + 1;\n    loop invariant sn <= size;\n    loop invariant sn != 0 ==> sn == size;\n*/\n```\nThe first four invariants are straightforward and simply state the initial values of `i` and `sn`, as well as the maximum and minimum values that they can take.\n\nThe fifth invariant is a bit more interesting. It states that `i` is equal to `sn + 1`, which means that the loop is iterating over the array elements in the correct order.\n\nThe sixth invariant is the most important one. It states that if `sn` is non-zero, then it is equal to the number of non-zero elements in the array. This is the post-condition that we want to prove.\n\nNote that we have used implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. We have also used conjunctions to bound the maximum and minimum values that the variables can take, as well as to express their relationship. Finally, we have used the `assume` function to make the invariants trivially true at the beginning and end of the loop."
