This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `x`.\n\nNext, we can see that the loop body increments `i` by 1 and adds `y` to `j`. This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `x`, and `j` will be equal to `i * y` at the end of the loop.\n\nNow, let's find the necessary loop invariants. We need to find three types of loop invariants:\n\n1. Loop invariants that are true before the loop execution.\n2. Loop invariants that are true in every iteration of the loop.\n3. Loop invariants that are true after the loop termination.\n\nFor the first type of loop invariant, we need to find a condition that is true before the loop execution. In this case, we can see that the loop condition is `i <= x`, so we can use this as our first loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant i <= x; */\n```\nFor the second type of loop invariant, we need to find a condition that is true in every iteration of the loop. In this case, we can see that the loop body increments `i` by 1 and adds `y` to `j`. This means that `i` will be equal to `j + 1` at the end of the loop. So, we can use the following loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant i == j + 1; */\n```\nFor the third type of loop invariant, we need to find a condition that is true after the loop termination. In this case, we can see that the loop terminates when `i` is greater than `x`. So, we can use the following loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant i > x; */\n```\nNow, we can combine these loop invariants into a single loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant i <= x && i == j + 1 && i > x; */\n```\nThis loop invariant is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. It implies the post-condition that `i == j`, which is the condition that is being checked in the assertion.\n\nSo, the necessary loop invariants for the loop in the program above are:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant i <= x && i == j + 1 && i > x; */\n```\nWe can use these loop invariants to verify the post-condition in the program using Frama-C."
