We have `i`, `j`, `x`, `y`, `z1`, `z2`, and `z3`.\n\nNext, we need to identify the loop condition. The loop condition is `(x != 0)`. This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as `x` is not equal to zero.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body. The loop body consists of two statements: `x = x - 1` and `y = y - 1`. These statements decrement `x` and `y` by 1 in each iteration of the loop.\n\nBased on the loop condition and the loop body, we can identify the following loop invariants:\n\n1. `x` is always greater than or equal to zero. This is because the loop condition checks whether `x` is not equal to zero, and `x` is only decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. Therefore, `x` can never be negative.\n2. `y` is always greater than or equal to zero. This is because `y` is only decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, and `y` is initialized to `y` at the beginning of the loop. Therefore, `y` can never be negative.\n3. `i` is always equal to `x`. This is because `i` is initialized to `x` at the beginning of the loop, and `x` is not modified in the loop body. Therefore, `i` will always be equal to `x`.\n4. `j` is always equal to `y`. This is because `j` is initialized to `y` at the beginning of the loop, and `y` is not modified in the loop body. Therefore, `j` will always be equal to `y`.\n5. `z1`, `z2`, and `z3` are always equal to zero. This is because these variables are not used in the loop at all, and therefore their values will not change during the execution of the loop.\n\nNow, let's use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. We can use implication to make the loop invariants trivially true at the beginning and end of the loop, and to make them false when the loop condition is not satisfied.\n\nFor example, we can use the implication `(x != 0) ==> (x >= 0)` to make the loop invariant `x >= 0` true when `x` is not equal to zero, and false when `x` is equal to zero.\n\nHere are the loop invariants for the loop in the given program, written in ACSL format:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant (x != 0) ==> (x >= 0);\n    loop invariant (y != 0) ==> (y >= 0);\n    loop invariant (i == x);\n    loop invariant (j == y);\n    loop invariant (z1 == 0);\n    loop invariant (z2 == 0);\n    loop invariant (z3 == 0);\n*/\n```\nThese loop invariants capture the behavior of the loop and can be used to verify the post-condition of the loop."

The second loop invariant states that if `x` is not equal to 0, then `x` is equal to `x - 1` and `y` is equal to `y - 1`. The third loop invariant states that if `y` is not equal to 0, then `i` is equal to `j`.\n\nBy using implication, we can ensure that the loop invariants are true before the loop, during each iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination, respectively.

The loop invariant should be true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nLet's start by finding the loop invariant that is true before the loop execution. We can see that the variable `i` is assigned the value of `x` before the loop starts, and the variable `j` is assigned the value of `y`. Therefore, we can conclude that the loop invariant `i == x && j == y` is true before the loop execution.\n\nNext, we need to find the loop invariant that is true in every iteration of the loop. We can see that the loop body consists of two assignments: `(x  = (x - 1))` and `(y  = (y - 1))`. These assignments decrease the value of `x` and `y` by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, we can conclude that the loop invariant `x >= 0 && y >= 0` is true in every iteration of the loop.\n\nFinally, we need to find the loop invariant that is true after the loop termination. We can see that the loop terminates when `x` becomes 0. Therefore, we can conclude that the loop invariant `x == 0` is true after the loop termination.\n\nNow, we need to impose the necessary bounds on the variables to make the loop invariants meaningful. We can see that the variable `x` can take any value between 0 and `INT_MAX`, and the variable `y` can take any value between 0 and `INT_MAX`. Therefore, we can impose the bounds `0 <= x <= INT_MAX` and `0 <= y <= INT_MAX` on the variables `x` and `y`.\n\nWe can also see that the variable `i` is always equal to `x`, and the variable `j` is always equal to `y`. Therefore, we can impose the relation `i == x && j == y` on the variables `i` and `j`.\n\nFinally, we need to take care of the conditional nature of the code. We can see that the assertion `(i != j)` is guarded by the condition `y != 0`.

To find the loop invariants, we need to analyze the loop body and the loop condition.\n\nFirst, let's make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program. The pre-conditions are:\n\n* `i = x`\n* `j = y`\n\nNext, let's analyze the loop body. The loop body has two statements:\n\n* `x = x - 1`\n* `y = y - 1`\n\nFrom the loop body, we can infer that the loop invariant `i = x` and `j = y` are maintained throughout the loop.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop condition. The loop condition is `x != 0`. This means that the loop will terminate when `x` becomes 0.\n\nTo find the loop invariants, we need to consider the three conditions: before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nBefore the loop execution:\n\n* `i = x` (from the pre-condition)\n* `j = y` (from the pre-condition)\n\nIn every iteration of the loop:\n\n* `i = x` (maintained by the loop body)\n* `j = y` (maintained by the loop body)\n\nAfter the loop termination:\n\n* `i = x` (from the pre-condition)\n* `j = y` (from the pre-condition)\n\nSince the loop invariants are necessary to verify the post-condition of the loop, we can use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. Let's use implication to make the invariants trivially true at the beginning and end of the loop.\n\nBefore the loop execution:\n\n* `i = x` (from the pre-condition)\n* `j = y` (from the pre-condition)\n* `x != 0` (from the loop condition)\n\nIn every iteration of the loop:\n\n* `i = x` (maintained by the loop body)\n* `j = y` (maintained by the loop body)\n* `x != 0` (from the loop condition)\n\nAfter the loop termination:\n\n* `i = x` (from the pre-condition)\n* `j = y` (from the pre-condition)\n* `x = 0` (from the loop condition)\n\nNow, let's add conjunctions that bound the maximum and minimum values that the variables can take, if such bounds exist.\n\n* `i >= 0` (since `i` is an integer)\n* `j >= 0` (since `j` is an integer)\n* `x >= 0` (since `x` is an integer)\n* `y >= 0` (since `y` is an integer)\n\nFinally, let's add conjunctions for the relations between the variables.\n\n* `i <= x` (since `i` is assigned to `x`)\n* `j <= y` (since `j` is assigned to `y`)\n\nNow, we have the necessary loop invariants to verify the post-condition of the loop. The loop invariants are:\n\n* `i = x` (before the loop execution)\n* `j = y` (before the loop execution)\n* `i = x` (in every iteration of the loop)\n* `j = y` (in every iteration of the loop)\n* `x != 0` (in every iteration of the loop)\n* `i = x` (after the loop termination)\n* `j = y` (after the loop termination)\n* `x = 0` (after the loop termination)\n* `i >= 0` (before the loop execution)\n* `j >= 0` (before the loop execution)\n* `x >= 0` (in every iteration of the loop)\n* `y >= 0` (in every iteration of the loop)\n* `i <= x` (in every iteration of the loop)\n* `j <= y` (in every iteration of the loop)\n\nHere are the loop invariants in the format required by Frama-C:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i = x;\n    loop invariant j = y;\n    loop invariant i = x",

To find the loop invariants, we need to analyze the loop body and the loop condition.\n\nFirst, let's make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program. The pre-conditions are:\n\n* `i = x`\n* `j = y`\n\nNext, let's analyze the loop body. The loop body has two statements:\n\n* `x = x - 1`\n* `y = y - 1`\n\nFrom the loop body, we can infer that the loop invariant `i = x` and `j = y` are maintained throughout the loop.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop condition. The loop condition is `x != 0`. This means that the loop will terminate when `x` becomes 0.\n\nTo find the loop invariants, we need to consider the three conditions: before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nBefore the loop execution:\n\n* `i = x` (from the pre-condition)\n* `j = y` (from the pre-condition)\n\nIn every iteration of the loop:\n\n* `i = x` (maintained by the loop body)\n* `j = y` (maintained by the loop body)\n\nAfter the loop termination:\n\n* `i = x` (from the pre-condition)\n* `j = y` (from the pre-condition)\n\nSince the loop invariants are necessary to verify the post-condition of the loop, we can use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. Let's use implication to make the invariants trivially true at the beginning and end of the loop.\n\nBefore the loop execution:\n\n* `i = x` (from the pre-condition)\n* `j = y` (from the pre-condition)\n* `x != 0` (from the loop condition)\n\nIn every iteration of the loop:\n\n* `i = x` (maintained by the loop body)\n* `j = y` (maintained by the loop body)\n* `x != 0` (from the loop condition)\n\nAfter the loop termination:\n\n* `i = x` (from the pre-condition)\n* `j = y` (from the pre-condition)\n* `x = 0` (from the loop condition)\n\nNow, let's add conjunctions that bound the maximum and minimum values that the variables can take, if such bounds exist.\n\n* `i >= 0` (since `i` is an integer)\n* `j >= 0` (since `j` is an integer)\n* `x >= 0` (since `x` is an integer)\n* `y >= 0` (since `y` is an integer)\n\nFinally, let's add conjunctions for the relations between the variables.\n\n* `i <= x` (since `i` is assigned to `x`)\n* `j <= y` (since `j` is assigned to `y`)\n\nNow, we have the necessary loop invariants to verify the post-condition of the loop. The loop invariants are:\n\n* `i = x` (before the loop execution)\n* `j = y` (before the loop execution)\n* `i = x` (in every iteration of the loop)\n* `j = y` (in every iteration of the loop)\n* `x != 0` (in every iteration of the loop)\n* `i = x` (after the loop termination)\n* `j = y` (after the loop termination)\n* `x = 0` (after the loop termination)\n* `i >= 0` (before the loop execution)\n* `j >= 0` (before the loop execution)\n* `x >= 0` (in every iteration of the loop)\n* `y >= 0` (in every iteration of the loop)\n* `i <= x` (in every iteration of the loop)\n* `j <= y` (in every iteration of the loop)\n\nHere are the loop invariants in the format required by Frama-C:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i = x;\n    loop invariant j = y;\n    loop invariant i = x",
