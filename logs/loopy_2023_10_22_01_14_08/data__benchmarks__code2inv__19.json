The first statement updates the value of `m` to `x`, while the second statement increments the value of `x` by 1.\n* The loop condition is `x < n`. It checks whether `x` is less than `n`.\n\nNow, let's find the loop invariants:\n\n* Before the loop execution, we have `x == 0` and `m == 0`.\n* In every iteration of the loop, we have `x < n` and `m <= x`.\n* After the loop termination, we have `x == n` and `m < n`.\n\nThe loop invariants imply the post-condition, which is `m < n`. Therefore, we can use the loop invariants to verify the post-condition.\n\nHere are the loop invariants in ACSL format:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant x == 0;\n    loop invariant m == 0;\n    loop invariant x < n;\n    loop invariant m <= x;\n    loop invariant x == n;\n    loop invariant m < n;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have added conjunctions to bound the maximum and minimum values that the variables `x`, `n`, and `m` can take. We have also added conjunctions to express the relationship between the variables `x` and `m`.
