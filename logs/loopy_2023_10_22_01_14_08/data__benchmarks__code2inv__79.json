For example, we can express the first loop invariant as \"Before the loop execution, `i` is less than or equal to `y`\" implies \"In every iteration of the loop, `i` is less than or equal to `y`\".\n\nConjunctions:\n\nWe can also use conjunctions to bound the maximum and minimum values that the variables `i`, `x`, and `y` can take. For example, we can add the conjunction \"0 <= `i` <= `y`\" to the loop invariants to bound the value of `i` between 0 and `y`.\n\nRelations:\n\nWe can also add conjunctions to express the relations between the variables `i`, `x`, and `y`. For example, we can add the conjunction \"0 <= `i` <= `x`\" to the loop invariants to express the relation between `i` and `x`.\n\nAssertion:\n\nFinally, we can use the assertion \"0 <= `i` <= `y`\" to verify the post-condition of the loop.\n\nHere is the complete code block for the loop invariants:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant 0 <= i <= y;\n    loop invariant 0 <= i <= x;\n    loop invariant 0 <= i <= y;\n    loop invariant if (i >= x) { i >= y };\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used implication and conjunctions to express the loop invariants in a more concise and readable way.

The loop body consists of a single if statement that increments the variable `i` if `i` is less than `y`.\n2. The loop condition is `unknown()`, which is a function call that is not defined in the program.\n3. The loop invariants must be true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nTo find the loop invariants, we can start by identifying the variables that are involved in the loop body and the loop condition. The variables are `i`, `x`, `y`, and `unknown()`.\n\nNext, we can analyze the loop body to identify the invariants that are true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop. The loop body consists of a single if statement that increments `i` if `i` is less than `y`. This means that `i` is always less than or equal to `y` in the loop body. We can express this as a loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant i <= y; */\n```\nThis loop invariant is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nNext, we can analyze the loop condition to identify the invariants that are true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop. The loop condition is `unknown()`, which is a function call that is not defined in the program. We cannot make any assumptions about this function, so we cannot derive any loop invariants from it.\n\nHowever, we can use the `assume` statements in the program to derive loop invariants. The `assume` statements are used to specify preconditions for the program. In this case, we can use the `assume` statements to specify that `x` and `y` are non-negative and that `x` is greater than or equal to `y`. We can express these assumptions as loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant x >= 0; */\n/*@ loop invariant y >= 0; */\n/*@ loop invariant x >= y; */\n```\nThese loop invariants are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nFinally, we can analyze the post-condition to identify the invariants that are true after the loop termination. The post-condition is `i >= y`, which means that `i` is greater than or equal to `y` after the loop. We can express this as a loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant i >= y; */\n```\nThis loop invariant is true after the loop termination.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the while loop in the given program are:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant i <= y; */\n/*@ loop invariant x >= 0; */\n/*@ loop invariant y >= 0; */\n/*@ loop invariant x >= y; */\n/*@ loop invariant i >= y; */\n```\nThese loop invariants are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination."
