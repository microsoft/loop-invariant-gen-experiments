The loop body increments `i` if it is smaller than `y`, and the loop invariant is that `i` is non-negative.\n\nTo find the necessary loop invariants for the program, we need to analyze the loop body and the loop condition.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the loop body. The loop body increments `i` by 1 if it is smaller than `y`. This means that `i` is always non-negative, and it can be at most `y - 1` in the loop body. We can express this as a conjunction of two invariants:\n\n1. `i >= 0`\n2. `i <= y - 1`\n\nNext, let's analyze the loop condition. The loop condition is `unknown()`, which is a non-deterministic function that returns a non-zero value if the loop should continue executing. We can't make any assumptions about the behavior of `unknown()`, so we can't infer any invariants from it.\n\nFinally, let's think about the post-condition. The post-condition is that `i` is non-negative, which is the same as the loop invariant we derived earlier.\n\nNow, let's combine all the invariants we derived:\n\n1. `i >= 0`\n2. `i <= y - 1`\n3. `unknown()` returns a non-zero value\n\nWe can use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code, so the loop invariants become:\n\n1. `i >= 0` implies `i <= y - 1`\n2. `i <= y - 1` implies `unknown()` returns a non-zero value\n\nFinally, we can add conjunctions that bound the maximum and minimum values that `i` can take, if such bounds exist. In this case, `i` can be at most `y - 1` and at least 0, so we can add the following invariant:\n\n1. `0 <= i <= y - 1`\n\nPutting it all together, the loop invariants for the while loop in the program are:\n\n1. `i >= 0` implies `i <= y - 1`\n2. `i <= y - 1` implies `unknown()` returns a non-zero value\n3. `0 <= i <= y - 1`\n\nNote that we have used implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code, and we have added conjunctions that bound the maximum and minimum values that `i` can take.",
