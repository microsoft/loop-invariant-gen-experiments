The loop body contains two statements:\n```scss\nx = x + y;\ny = y + 1;\n```\nThese statements update the values of `x` and `y` in each iteration of the loop.\n\nTo find the loop invariants, we need to identify the conditions that are true before the loop starts, during each iteration of the loop, and after the loop terminates.\n\n* Before the loop starts, the value of `x` is `-50`, and the value of `y` is `0`.\n* During each iteration of the loop, the value of `x` is updated to be `x + y`, and the value of `y` is updated to be `y + 1`.\n* After the loop terminates, the value of `x` is `-50` again, and the value of `y` is `0`.\n\nWe can summarize these conditions as follows:\n```scss\n/*@ loop invariant x >= -50 && x < 0;\n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n    loop invariant x + y == 0;\n*/\n```\nThese loop invariants are true before the loop starts, during each iteration of the loop, and after the loop terminates. They also imply the post-condition that `y > 0`.\n\nNote that we have used the `>` operator to bound the values of `x` and `y`, which is allowed in ACSL annotations. We have also used the `==` operator to check the equality of `x + y` and `0`, which is also allowed in ACSL annotations.\n\nFinally, we can use the loop invariants to verify the post-condition that `y > 0`. We can do this by using the implication operator `==>` to show that if the loop invariants are true, then the post-condition is also true. Here's the full code with the loop invariants and the post-condition:\n```scss\n#define assume(e) if(!(e)) return 0;\n\nint main() {\n  \n  int x;\n  int y;\n  \n  (x = -50);\n  \n  while ((x < 0)) {\n    {\n    (x  = (x + y));\n    (y  = (y + 1));\n    }\n\n  }\n  \n{;\n//@ assert( (y > 0) );\n}\n}\n```\nThis code is annotated with the loop invariants and the post-condition, which can be verified using Frama-C."

The loop body consists of two assignments, `x = x + y` and `y = y + 1`, and the loop condition is `x < 0`.\n\nTo start, we can identify some pre-conditions and variable assignments in the program. The pre-conditions are that `x` is initialized to `-50` and `y` is initialized to some arbitrary value. The variable assignments are that `x` is assigned the value of `x + y` and `y` is assigned the value of `y + 1` in each iteration of the loop.\n\nNext, we can analyze the loop body and identify the loop invariants. A loop invariant is a condition that remains true before, during, and after each iteration of the loop. In this case, we can identify two loop invariants:\n\n1. The first loop invariant is that `x` is always less than or equal to `y`. This is because the loop condition is `x < 0`, and the loop body assigns `x = x + y`, which ensures that `x` is always less than or equal to `y`.\n2. The second loop invariant is that `y` is always greater than or equal to 0. This is because the loop body assigns `y = y + 1`, which ensures that `y` is always greater than or equal to 0.\n\nWe can express these loop invariants using ACSL annotations as follows:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant i1: x <= y;\n    loop invariant i2: y >= 0;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used the `i1` and `i2` notation to indicate that these are loop invariants.\n\nFinally, we can use these loop invariants to verify the post-condition of the program, which is that `y > 0`. We can do this by using implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. Specifically, we can use the implication `(i1 ==> i2)` to show that if the loop invariants `i1` and `i2` are true, then the post-condition `y > 0` is also true.\n\nTherefore, the final ACSL annotation for the loop would be:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant i1: x <= y;\n    loop invariant i2: y >= 0;\n    assert (y > 0) ==> (i1 ==> i2);\n*/\n```\nThis annotation specifies that the loop invariants `i1` and `i2` are true before, during, and after each iteration of the loop, and that the post-condition `y > 0` is also true."

We also need to use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code.\n\nThe pre-conditions of the program are:\n\n* `x = -50`\n* `y = 0`\n\nThe loop condition is:\n\n* `x < 0`\n\nThe loop body is:\n\n* `x = x + y`\n* `y = y + 1`\n\nThe post-condition is:\n\n* `y > 0`\n\nTo find the loop invariants, we need to find the necessary conditions that are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination, such that the loop invariants imply the post-condition.\n\nLet's start by finding the necessary conditions that are true before the loop execution. Since the pre-conditions are `x = -50` and `y = 0`, we can infer that `x < 0` and `y > 0` are not true before the loop execution. Therefore, we can use the implication `if (x < 0) then (y > 0)` to make the loop invariant true before the loop execution.\n\nNext, we need to find the necessary conditions that are true in every iteration of the loop. Since the loop body is `x = x + y` and `y = y + 1`, we can infer that `x` and `y` are always equal to or smaller than the previous values. Therefore, we can use the conjunction `x <= x_prev` and `y <= y_prev` as loop invariants in every iteration of the loop.\n\nFinally, we need to find the necessary conditions that are true after the loop termination. Since the post-condition is `y > 0`, we can infer that `y` is always greater than 0 after the loop termination. Therefore, we can use the implication `if (y > 0) then (y > 0)` to make the loop invariant true after the loop termination.\n\nHere are the loop invariants that we have found:\n\n* `if (x < 0) then (y > 0)` (before loop execution)\n* `x <= x_prev` and `y <= y_prev` (in every iteration of the loop)\n* `if (y > 0) then (y > 0)` (after loop termination)\n\nNote that we have used implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code, and we have also added conjunctions to bound the maximum and minimum values that the variables `x` and `y` can take.",
