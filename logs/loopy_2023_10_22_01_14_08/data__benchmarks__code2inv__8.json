A loop invariant is a condition that is true before the loop execution, and remains true in every iteration of the loop and after the loop termination.\n\nWe can start by identifying the loop invariants that are true before the loop execution. Since the loop condition is `unknown()`, we cannot make any assumptions about the loop condition before the loop execution. Therefore, we cannot identify any loop invariants that are true before the loop execution.\n\nNext, let's identify the loop invariants that are true in every iteration of the loop. Since the loop body modifies `x` and `y` to `x + 10` and `y + 10`, respectively, we can add the following loop invariants:\n\n* `x + 10` is equal to `x`\n* `y + 10` is equal to `y`\n\nFinally, let's identify the loop invariants that are true after the loop termination. Since the loop condition is `unknown()`, we cannot make any assumptions about the loop condition after the loop termination. Therefore, we cannot identify any loop invariants that are true after the loop termination.\n\nPutting it all together, we have the following loop invariants:\n\n* `x + 10` is equal to `x`\n* `y + 10` is equal to `y`\n\nNote that these loop invariants are only valid if the loop condition is `unknown()`. If the loop condition is known, the loop invariants may not be valid.",
