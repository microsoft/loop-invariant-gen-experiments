Also, we have used the `;` symbol to separate the loop invariants.\n\nNow, let's think about the assertion in the program. The assertion is:\n```\nassert(y >= 0);\n```\nThis means that the value of `y` is greater than or equal to 0. We can use this assertion to verify that the loop invariants are true.\n\nTo do this, we can use the `assume` function to assume that the assertion is true, and then use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. We can write the `assume` function as follows:\n```\nassume(y >= 0);\n```\nThis means that we are assuming that the value of `y` is greater than or equal to 0. We can then use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code, as follows:\n```\nif (y >= 0) {\n    assert(y >= 0);\n}\n```\nThis means that if the value of `y` is greater than or equal to 0, then we can assert that the value of `y` is greater than or equal to 0.\n\nFinally, we can use the loop invariants to verify that the assertion is true. We can write the loop invariants as follows:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant y == 0;\n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n*/\n```\nThis means that we are assuming that the value of `y` is equal to 0, and that the value of `y` is greater than or equal to 0. We can then use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code, as follows:\n```\nif (y >= 0) {\n    assert(y >= 0);\n}\n```\nThis means that if the value of `y` is greater than or equal to 0, then we can assert that the value of `y` is greater than or equal to 0.\n\nIn summary, the loop invariants for the while loop in the program are:\n\n1.

We can start by identifying the variables that are modified within the loop and the variables that are used in the loop condition.\n\nIn this case, the loop body modifies the variable `y` and the loop condition is `y >= 0`. The loop also uses the variable `x` which is initialized to 0 at the beginning of the program.\n\nWe can start by adding a conjunction to bound the maximum and minimum values that `y` can take. Let's assume that the maximum value that `y` can take is 1000 and the minimum value is -1000. We can add the following conjunction to the loop invariant:\n```\ny >= -1000 && y <= 1000\n```\nNext, we can add a conjunction to bound the maximum and minimum values that `x` can take. Let's assume that the maximum value that `x` can take is 1000 and the minimum value is -1000. We can add the following conjunction to the loop invariant:\n```\nx >= -1000 && x <= 1000\n```\nNow, we need to add a conjunction to represent the relationship between `x` and `y`. Since `y` is always equal to or larger than `x`, we can add the following conjunction to the loop invariant:\n```\ny >= x\n```\nFinally, we need to add a conjunction to make the invariant trivially true at the beginning and end of the loop. We can add the following conjunction to the loop invariant:\n```\ny == 0 || y == 1000\n```\nSo, the complete loop invariant for the while loop in the program is:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant y >= -1000 && y <= 1000;\n    loop invariant x >= -1000 && x <= 1000;\n    loop invariant y >= x;\n    loop invariant y == 0 || y == 1000;\n*/\n```\nThis loop invariant implies the post-condition `y >= 0`, which is the desired property that we want to verify using Frama-C."
