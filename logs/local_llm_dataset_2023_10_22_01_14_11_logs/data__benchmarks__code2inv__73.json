Before the loop execution:\nWe need to ensure that the loop condition is true before the loop execution. We can do this by adding the following loop invariant:\n```c\n/*@ loop invariant unknown(); @*/\n```\nThis invariant ensures that the loop condition is true before the loop execution.\n2. In every iteration of the loop:\nWe need to ensure that the loop condition remains true in every iteration of the loop. We can do this by adding the following loop invariant:\n```c\n/*@ loop invariant unknown(); @*/\n```\nThis invariant ensures that the loop condition remains true in every iteration of the loop.\n3.

We can do this by adding the following loop invariant:\n```c\n/*@ loop invariant (c < 36); @*/\n```\nThis invariant ensures that the loop terminates after a finite number of iterations, since the value of `c` is incremented by 1 in every iteration and is less than 36.\n\n4. Non-deterministic variables:\nWe need to ensure that the variables `z` and `c` are non-deterministic at the beginning and end of the loop. We can do this by adding the following loop invariants:\n```c\n/*@ loop invariant (z == 36 * y); @*/\n/*@ loop invariant (c == 0); @*/\n```\nThese invariants ensure that the variables `z` and `c` are non-deterministic at the beginning and end of the loop, respectively.\n\n5. Implication:\nWe can use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. We can add the following implication to the loop invariants:\n```c\n/*@ loop invariant (c < 36) ==> (z < 0); @*/\n```\nThis implication ensures that if the value of `c` is less than 36, then the value of `z` is less than 0.\n\n6. Bounds:\nWe can add conjunctions to bound the maximum and minimum values that the variables `z` and `c` can take. We can add the following conjunctions to the loop invariants:\n```c\n/*@ loop invariant (0 <= z <= 36 * y); @*/\n/*@ loop invariant (0 <= c <= 36); @*/\n```\nThese conjunctions ensure that the values of `z` and `c` are within the bounds of 0 and 36.\n\n7. Relation:\nWe can add conjunctions to show the relationship between the variables `z` and `c`. We can add the following conjunctions to the loop invariants:\n```c\n/*@ loop invariant (z == c * 127); @*/\n```\nThis conjunction ensures that the value of `z` is equal to the value of `c` multiplied by 127.\n\nThe final loop invariants for the while loop in the given program are:\n```c\n/*@\n    loop invariant unknown();\n    loop invariant (z == 36 * y);\n    loop invariant (c == 0);\n    loop invariant (c < 36) ==> (z < 0);\n    loop invariant (0 <= z <= 36 * y);\n    loop invariant (0 <= c <= 36);\n    loop invariant (z == c * 127);\n*/\n```\nThese loop invariants ensure that the loop terminates after a finite number of iterations, the loop condition remains true in every iteration of the loop, and the variables `z` and `c` are non-deterministic at the beginning and end of the loop."

The first if-statement checks if `c < 36`, and if so, increments both `z` and `c` by 1.

We can also identify the variables that are used in the loop condition and the if-statements. These are `y`, `z`, and `c`.\n\nNext, we need to identify the loop invariants. A loop invariant is a condition that is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.

This if-statement is equivalent to `z < 0 ==> z + 1 < 0`, which implies that `z >= 0` if the loop terminates.\n\nWe can also consider the relationship between `z` and `c`. The loop body increments both `z` and `c` by 1 if `c < 36`. This means that `z` is always equal to or smaller than `c`.\n\nFinally, we can consider the post-condition `c >= 36`. This post-condition is implied by the loop invariants we have identified so far. If the loop terminates, then `c` is greater than or equal to 36, which implies that `c >= 36`.\n\nHere are the loop invariants that we have identified:\n\n* `c < 36 ==> c + 1 < 36`\n* `z < 0 ==> z + 1 < 0`\n* `z <= c`\n* `c >= 36`\n\nWe can use these loop invariants to verify the post-condition `c >= 36` using Frama-C. We can add the loop invariants as ACSL annotations to the program, and then use Frama-C to verify the post-condition.\n\nHere is the annotated program with the loop invariants:\n```\n#define assume(e) if(!(e)) return 0;\nextern int unknown(void);\n\nint main() {\n  \n  int c;\n  int y;\n  int z;\n  \n  (c = 0);\n  assume((y >= 0));\n  assume((y >= 127));\n  (z = (36 * y));\n  \n  /*@\n    loop invariant c < 36 ==> c + 1 < 36;\n    loop invariant z < 0 ==> z + 1 < 0;\n    loop invariant z <= c;\n    loop invariant c >= 36;\n  */\n  while (unknown()) {\n    if ( (c < 36) )\n    {\n    (z  = (z + 1));\n    (c  = (c + 1));\n    }\n\n  }\n  \nif ( (z < 0) )\nif ( (z >= 4608) )\n{;\n//@ assert( (c >= 36) );\n}\n\n}\n```\nUsing Frama-C, we can verify the post"
