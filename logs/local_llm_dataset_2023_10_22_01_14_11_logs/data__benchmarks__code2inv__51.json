This is because the loop body does nothing if `unknown()` returns a zero value. Therefore, `c` retains its initial value of 0.\n\nHere are the loop invariants in ACSL notation:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n    loop invariant i3;\n    loop invariant i4;\n*/\n```\nwhere `i1` is `c <= 4`, `i2` is `c >= 0`, `i3` is `c == 1 if unknown() != 0`, and `i4` is `c == 0 if unknown() == 0`.\n\nNote that we have used implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. We have also added conjunctions that bound the maximum and minimum values that `c` can take, and we have added a conjunction for the relation between `c` and `unknown()`. Finally, we have used the guard condition in an implication to make the invariant trivially true at the beginning and end of the loop."
