The second statement assigns the value of `z` to `y` if `z` is less than or equal to `y`.\n\nThe loop condition is `x < size`.\n\nBased on the loop body and the loop condition, we can deduce the following loop invariants:\n\n1. Before the loop execution, `x` is 0 and `y` is 0.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, `x` is less than or equal to `size`.\n3. After the loop termination, `z` is greater than or equal to `y`.\n\nTo express these loop invariants in ACSL, we can use the following annotations:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x == 0 && y == 0;\n    loop invariant x <= size;\n    loop invariant z >= y;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used the `==` operator to check for equality, and the `<=` and `>=` operators to check for less than or equal to and greater than or equal to, respectively.\n\nWe have also used the `&&` operator to combine the loop invariants into a single annotation.\n\nFinally, we have used the `;` character to separate the annotations for each loop invariant.\n\nWith these loop invariants in place, Frama-C can verify that the loop satisfies the post-condition `z >= y`."
