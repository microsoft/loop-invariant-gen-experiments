For example, if `n` is non-deterministic at the beginning of the loop, we can use the following loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant (x < n) && (x >= 0) ==> (n >= 0);\n*/\n```\nThis loop invariant is true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop. It implies the post-condition that `n` is non-negative.\n\nIf the assertion is guarded by a condition, we can use the guard condition in an implication. For example, if the assertion is guarded by the condition `n >= 0`, we can use the following loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant (x < n) && (x >= 0) ==> (n >= 0) && (x == n);\n*/\n```\nThis loop invariant is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. It implies the post-condition that `x` is equal to `n` and `n` is non-negative.\n\nIn summary, the necessary loop invariants for the while loop in the given program are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant (x < n) && (x >= 0);\n    loop invariant (x < n) && (x >= 0) ==> (n >= 0);\n    loop invariant (x < n) && (x >= 0) ==> (n >= 0) && (x == n);\n*/\n```\nThese loop invariants are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. They imply the post-condition that `x` is equal to `n` and `n` is non-negative."
