We can see that `i` is initialized to 1 before the loop, and it is incremented by 1 in every iteration. Therefore, we can infer that `i` is always less than or equal to 8. We can represent this as a loop invariant as follows:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant i <= 8; @*/\n```\nNext, we can analyze the loop body. The first statement in the loop body is `(i = i + 1)`, which increments `i` by 1. We can represent this as a loop invariant as follows:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant i <= 8; @*/\n```\nThe second statement in the loop body is `(sn = sn + 1)`, which increments `sn` by 1. We can represent this as a loop invariant as follows:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant sn <= 8; @*/\n```\nNow, we need to check if the loop invariant is true before the loop execution. Since `i` is initialized to 1 before the loop, we can infer that `i` is less than or equal to 8. Therefore, the loop invariant `i <= 8` is true before the loop execution.\n\nNext, we need to check if the loop invariant is true in every iteration of the loop. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in every iteration, we can infer that `i` is always less than or equal to 8. Therefore, the loop invariant `i <= 8` is true in every iteration of the loop.\n\nFinally, we need to check if the loop invariant is true after the loop termination. Since `sn` is incremented by 1 in every iteration, we can infer that `sn` is always less than or equal to 8. Therefore, the loop invariant `sn <= 8` is true after the loop termination.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclude that the loop invariant `i <= 8` is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. Similarly, the loop invariant `sn <= 8` is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nTherefore, the necessary loop invariants for the while loop in the program are:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant i <= 8; @*/\n/*@ loop invariant sn <= 8; @*/\n```\nNote that we have not used any variables or functions that are not declared in the program, and we have not made any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given. We have also not used any keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops."
