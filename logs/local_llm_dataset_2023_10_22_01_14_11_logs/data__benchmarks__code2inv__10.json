These include the loop condition and any invariant that is preserved across loop iterations. The loop condition is `unknown() == 0`, and the loop invariant that is preserved across loop iterations is `x + y <= 4`.\n\nFinally, we can identify the loop invariants that are true after the loop termination. These include the post-condition of the program, which is `y == 0 ==> x != 4`.\n\nTherefore, the necessary loop invariants for this program are:\n\n* `x >= 0`\n* `x <= 2`\n* `y <= 2`\n* `y >= 0`\n* `x + y <= 4`\n* `y == 0 ==> x != 4`\n\nNote that we have used implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. We have also added conjunctions that bound the maximum and minimum values that the variables `x` and `y` can take, if such bounds exist. We have also added a conjunction for the relation between the variables `x` and `y`. Finally, we have used implication to make the invariant trivially true at the beginning and end of the loop."
