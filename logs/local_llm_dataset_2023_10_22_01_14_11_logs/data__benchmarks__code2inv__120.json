            "content": " To find the necessary loop invariants for the while loop in the given program, we need to analyze the loop body and the post-condition.\n\nThe loop body is:\n```\ni = i + 1;\nsn = sn + 1;\n```\nThe post-condition is:\n```\nif (sn != 8) {\n  assert(sn == 0);\n}\n```\nWe can see that the loop body increments the variable `i` and `sn` by 1 in each iteration. The post-condition checks whether `sn` is equal to 8 and if it's not, it asserts that `sn` is equal to 0.\n\nBased on the information above, we can derive the following loop invariants:\n\n1. Before the loop execution, `i` is equal to 1 and `sn` is equal to 0.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, `i` is equal to `sn` plus 1.\n3. After the loop termination, `sn` is equal to 8 if the loop condition is true, otherwise it's equal to 0.\n\nWe can express these loop invariants in ACSL annotations as follows:\n```\n/*@\n  loop invariant i == sn + 1;\n  loop invariant sn == 0;\n  loop invariant sn == 8 ==> (i == sn + 1);\n@*/\n```\nHere, we use the `==` operator to denote equality between variables, and the `==>` operator to denote implication. The first two invariants are true before the loop execution and in every iteration, while the third invariant is true after the loop termination.\n\nNote that we don't need to use the `assume` keyword in the loop invariants, as the `if` keyword is not supported in ACSL annotations for loops."
