The pre-conditions are that `size` is greater than 0, and `x` is initialized to 0. The variable assignments are that `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, and `y` is assigned to `z` if `z` is less than or equal to `y`.\n\nNext, let's analyze the loop body. The loop body consists of two statements: `x += 1` and `y = z` if `z` is less than or equal to `y`. We can write the loop condition as `x < size`.\n\nNow, let's find the loop invariants. A loop invariant is a statement that is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.

We have also used the `>=` operator to check for greater than or equal to.\n\nFinally, we can use the loop invariants to verify the post-condition of the program. The post-condition is that `z` is greater than or equal to `y`. We can use the loop invariants to prove that the post-condition is true.\n\nFor example, we can use the loop invariant `z >= y` to prove that `z` is greater than or equal to `y` after the loop termination. We can use the loop invariant `x < size` to prove that `x` is less than `size` in every iteration of the loop. We can use the loop invariant `x == 0` to prove that `x` is initialized to 0 before the loop execution.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the while loop in the given program are `x == 0`, `x < size`, and `z >= y`.

We have also used the implication operator (`==>`) to express the conditional nature of the code.\n\nNote that we have not used any variables or functions that are not declared in the program, and we have not made any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given. We have also avoided using keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops."

Pre-condition:\nThe pre-condition for the loop is `x < size`. This means that `x` is less than `size` before the loop starts.\n2. Loop body:\nThe loop body consists of two statements: `x += 1` and `if(z <= y) { y = z; }`. The first statement increments `x` by 1, and the second statement assigns `y` to `z` if `z` is less than or equal to `y`.\n3. Loop condition:\nThe loop condition is `x < size`. This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as `x` is less than `size`.\n4. Post-condition:\nThe post-condition for the loop is `z >= y`. This means that after the loop terminates, `z` is greater than or equal to `y`.\n\nNow, let's find the loop invariants for the loop. We need to find three loop invariants: one that is true before the loop execution, one that is true in every iteration of the loop, and one that is true after the loop termination.\n\n1. Before the loop execution:\nThe loop invariant before the loop execution is `x < size`. This means that `x` is less than `size` before the loop starts.\n2.

This means that after the loop terminates, `z` is greater than or equal to `y`.\n\nNow, let's output the loop invariants in ACSL annotations for loops.

Finally, we have used the guard condition in the implication to make the invariant trivially true at the beginning and end of the loop."
