In this case, the loop involves the variables `x` and `y`.\n\nNext, we need to identify the loop condition. The loop condition is `(y < 1000)`. This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as the value of `y` is less than 1000.\n\nNow, we need to identify the loop invariants. A loop invariant is a condition that is true before the loop starts, and remains true after each iteration of the loop. In other words, a loop invariant is a condition that is preserved throughout the execution of the loop.\n\nFrom the loop body, we can identify the following loop invariants:\n\n1. The value of `x` is always greater than or equal to `y`. This is because the loop body updates the value of `x` by adding the value of `y` to it. Since `y` is always less than 1000, the value of `x` will always be greater than or equal to `y`.\n2. The value of `y` is always less than 1000. This is because the loop condition checks whether `y` is less than 1000, and the loop body updates the value of `y` by adding 1 to it. Therefore, the value of `y` will always be less than 1000.\n3. The value of `x` is always less than or equal to 1000. This is because the loop body updates the value of `x` by adding the value of `y` to it, and the value of `y` is always less than 1000. Therefore, the value of `x` will always be less than or equal to 1000.\n\nNow, we need to add conjunctions to bound the maximum and minimum values that the variables `x` and `y` can take. We can add the following conjunctions:\n\n1. `x >= 0` and `x <= 1000`. This is because the loop body updates the value of `x` by adding the value of `y` to it, and the value of `y` is always less than 1000. Therefore, the value of `x` will always be greater than or equal to 0, and less than or equal to 1000.\n2. `y >= 0` and `y <= 1000`. This is because the loop condition checks whether `y` is less than 1000, and the loop body updates the value of `y` by adding 1 to it. Therefore, the value of `y` will always be greater than or equal to 0, and less than or equal to 1000.\n\nFinally, we need to add an implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. We can add the following implication:\n\n1. `if (y < 1000) then (x >= y)`. This is because the loop condition checks whether `y` is less than 1000, and the loop body updates the value of `x` by adding the value of `y` to it. Therefore, if `y` is less than 1000, then the value of `x` will always be greater than or equal to `y`.\n\nThe final loop invariants are:\n\n1. The value of `x` is always greater than or equal to `y`.\n2. The value of `y` is always less than 1000.\n3.
