Therefore, we can add the following loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant (x != 0 && y != 0); @*/\n```\nIn every iteration of the loop, we can add the following loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant (x - 1 != 0 && y - 1 != 0); @*/\n```\nAfter the loop termination, we can assume that `x` and `y` are equal to 0. Therefore, we can add the following loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant (x == 0 && y == 0); @*/\n```\nFinally, we can add the following loop invariant to ensure that the loop terminates when `x` becomes 0:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant (x != 0 ==> x - 1 != 0); @*/\n```\nPutting it all together, the loop invariants for the while loop in the given C program are:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant (x != 0 && y != 0);\n    loop invariant (x - 1 != 0 && y - 1 != 0);\n    loop invariant (x == 0 && y == 0);\n    loop invariant (x != 0 ==> x - 1 != 0);\n@*/\n```\nNote that we have used implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code, and we have added conjunctions to bound the maximum and minimum values that `x` and `y` can take. We have also added a conjunction to ensure that `x` and `y` are equal to 0 after the loop termination."
