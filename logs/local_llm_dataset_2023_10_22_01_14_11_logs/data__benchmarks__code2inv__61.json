We can also make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n\nThe loop condition is `unknown()`. The loop body consists of two if-else statements. The first if-else statement is `if (unknown()) { ... }`. The second if-else statement is `else { ... }`.\n\nThe first if-else statement has the condition `c != n`.

We have also added a conjunction for the relation between the variables `c` and `n`."
