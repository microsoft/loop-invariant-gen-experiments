We also want the loop invariants to imply the post condition.\n\nHere are some possible loop invariants:\n\n* `i <= x` (before loop execution)\n* `i <= x` (in every iteration of the loop)\n* `i <= x` (after loop termination)\n* `j <= y` (before loop execution)\n* `j <= y` (in every iteration of the loop)\n* `j <= y` (after loop termination)\n\nNote that these loop invariants are not exhaustive, and there may be other loop invariants that are also true.\n\nNow, let's think about how we can use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. We can use implication to make the loop invariants trivially true when certain conditions are not met. For example, if `y` is not equal to 1, then the loop invariant `j <= y` is trivially true.\n\nHere is the final set of loop invariants:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant i <= x;\n    loop invariant j <= y;\n    loop invariant (y == 1) ==> (i == j);\n    loop invariant (y != 1) ==> (i <= x);\n*/\n```\nThese loop invariants are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. They also imply the post condition, which is that `i == j` when `y` is equal to 1."

The loop starts with the initialization of variables `i`, `j`, and `x`, and the assignment of `y` to 1. We can assume that these variables are non-deterministic at the beginning of the loop.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body. The loop body consists of two assignments: `i = i + 1` and `j = j + y`. We can see that the value of `i` is always increasing by 1 in each iteration, and the value of `j` is always increasing by `y` in each iteration.\n\nNext, let's consider the loop condition. The loop condition is `i <= x`. We can see that the loop will terminate when `i` is greater than or equal to `x`.\n\nNow, let's find the loop invariants.

Therefore, we can use the loop invariants to prove the correctness of the program using Frama-C.\n\nHere is the annotated code with the loop invariants:\n```\n#define assume(e) if(!(e)) return 0;\n\nint main() {\n  \n  int i;\n  int j;\n  int x;\n  int y;\n  \n  (j = 0);\n  (i = 0);\n  (y = 1);\n  \n  /*@ \n    loop invariant i >= 0;\n    loop invariant j >= 0;\n    loop invariant i <= x;\n    loop invariant j <= i + y;\n    loop invariant y == 1;\n  */\n  while ((i <= x)) {\n    {\n    (i  = (i + 1));\n    (j  = (j + y));\n    }\n\n  }\n  \nif ( (y == 1) )\n{;\n//@ assert( (i == j) );\n}\n\n}\n```"
