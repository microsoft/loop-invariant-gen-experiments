            "content": " To find the necessary loop invariants for the while loop in the program, we need to analyze the loop body and the loop condition. We can start by making a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n\nPre-conditions:\n\n* `j = 0`\n* `k = 0`\n\nVariable assignments:\n\n* `m = a` (in the if-statement)\n* `k = k + 1` (in the loop body)\n\nNext, we can analyze the loop condition. The loop condition is `k < 1`. We can use this condition to derive the loop invariants.\n\nLoop Invariants:\n\n* `k >= 0` (since `k` is initialized to 0 and only incremented by 1 in each iteration)\n* `m <= a` (since `m` is assigned the value of `a` if `m < a`)\n* `k <= 1` (since `k` is incremented by 1 in each iteration and the loop terminates when `k < 1`)\n\nWe can also use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. For example, we can use the implication `m <= a ==> k <= 1` to express the fact that if `m` is less than or equal to `a`, then `k` is less than or equal to 1.\n\nFinally, we can add conjunctions that bound the maximum and minimum values that the variables can take, if such bounds exist. For example, we can add the conjunction `a >= 0` to express the fact that `a` is non-negative.\n\nHere are the loop invariants for the while loop in the program:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant k >= 0;\n    loop invariant m <= a;\n    loop invariant k <= 1;\n    loop invariant a >= 0;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code, and we have added conjunctions that bound the maximum and minimum values that the variables can take, if such bounds exist."
