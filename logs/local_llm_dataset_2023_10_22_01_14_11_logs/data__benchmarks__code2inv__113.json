We can start by making a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n\nPre-conditions:\n\n* `sn` is initialized to 0\n* `i` is initialized to 1\n\nVariable assignments:\n\n* `i` is assigned to `i + 1` in the loop body\n* `sn` is assigned to `sn + 1` in the loop body\n\nLoop condition:\n\n* The loop continues while `i` is less than or equal to `n`\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body and the loop condition to find the loop invariants. We can use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code.\n\nLoop invariants:\n\n* Before the loop execution, `sn` is equal to 0, which implies that `sn` is not equal to `n`\n* In every iteration of the loop, `sn` is equal to `sn + 1`, which implies that `sn` is not equal to `n`\n* After the loop termination, `sn` is equal to `n`, which implies that `sn` is not equal to 0\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant sn == 0;\n    loop invariant sn == sn + 1;\n    loop invariant sn != n;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. We have also added conjunctions that bound the maximum and minimum values that `sn` can take, if such bounds exist. Additionally, we have added a conjunction for the relation between `sn` and `n`. Finally, we have used an implication to make the invariant trivially true at the beginning and end of the loop, as certain variables are non-deterministic at those locations."

This invariant is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nHowever, we need to be careful when using this invariant, as the variable `i` is not initialized in the program. We can assume that `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop execution, as it is a common practice to initialize loop variables to 0 in C programs.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant is `sn == i` if `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop execution.\n\nHere is the loop invariant in ACSL syntax:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant sn == i;\n*/\n```\nNote that this loop invariant implies the post-condition `sn == n`, as `n` is a constant that is not changed during the loop execution."
