The first statement adds `y` to `x`, and the second statement adds 1 to `y`.\n\nTo find the loop invariant, we need to identify the conditions that must be true before, during, and after each iteration of the loop. We can do this by analyzing the loop body and identifying the variables that are modified and the conditions that must be true for the loop to terminate.\n\nThe loop invariant for this loop is:\n```scss\n(x >= 0) && (y > 0)\n```\nThis loop invariant is true before the loop starts, during each iteration of the loop, and after the loop ends. The first part of the loop invariant `(x >= 0)` ensures that `x` is always a non-negative number, which means that the loop will terminate eventually. The second part of the loop invariant `(y > 0)` ensures that `y` is always a positive number, which means that the loop will eventually terminate.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the given program is:\n```scss\n(x >= 0) && (y > 0)\n```\nThis loop invariant can be used to verify the post-condition of the loop, which is that `y > 0`."

The loop body consists of two assignments:\n```\nx = x + y;\ny = y + 1;\n```\nFrom these assignments, we can see that the value of `x` is increased by the value of `y` in each iteration of the loop. Also, the value of `y` is increased by 1 in each iteration.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop condition. The loop condition is `x < 0`. This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as the value of `x` is less than 0.\n\nBased on the analysis of the loop body and the loop condition, we can identify the following loop invariants:\n\n1. The value of `x` is always less than or equal to 0. This invariant is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n2. The value of `y` is always greater than or equal to 0. This invariant is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n3. The value of `z1`, `z2`, and `z3` are always equal to 0. This invariant is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n4. The value of `x` is always less than or equal to the value of `y`. This invariant is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nTo express these loop invariants in ACSL annotations, we can use the following code block:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x <= 0;\n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n    loop invariant z1 == 0;\n    loop invariant z2 == 0;\n    loop invariant z3 == 0;\n    loop invariant x <= y;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used the `<=` and `>=` operators to express the relationships between the variables `x` and `y`, and the constants 0. These operators are used to express the bounds on the values of the variables.\n\nAlso, note that we have used the `==` operator to express the equality of the variables `z1`, `z2`, and `z3` with the constant 0. This is used to express the invariant that these variables are always equal to 0.\n\nFinally, we have used the `<=`, `>=` and `<` operators to express the relationship between the variables `x` and `y`. This is used to express the invariant that the value of `x` is always less than or equal to the value of `y`."
