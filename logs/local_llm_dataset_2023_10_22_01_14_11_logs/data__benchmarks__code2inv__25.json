After the loop termination, `x` is equal to 0.\n\nThese loop invariants can be used to verify the post-condition of the program, which is:\n```css\n//@ assert( (x == 0) );\n```\nThe post-condition states that `x` is equal to 0 after the loop execution.\n\nTo express these loop invariants in ACSL annotations, we can use the following code block:\n```css\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nHere, `i1` and `i2` are the loop invariants that we identified earlier.\n\nSo, the complete ACSL annotations for the loop in the given program would be:\n```css\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x == 10000;\n    loop invariant x > 0;\n    loop invariant x == 0;\n*/\n```\nThis code block specifies the three loop invariants that we identified earlier. The first invariant states that `x` is equal to 10000 before the loop execution. The second invariant states that `x` is greater than 0 in every iteration of the loop. The third invariant states that `x` is equal to 0 after the loop termination.\n\nBy using these loop invariants, Frama-C can verify the post-condition of the program and ensure that the loop terminates correctly."

Loop Body:\nThe loop body consists of a single statement, which is an assignment to the variable `x`. The assignment reduces the value of `x` by 1 in each iteration of the loop.\n2. Loop Condition:\nThe loop condition is `x > 0`. The loop continues to execute as long as `x` is greater than 0.\n\nNow, let's find the loop invariants.\n\n1. Before the loop execution:\nThe variable `x` is initialized to 10000. Therefore, the loop invariant `x == 10000` is true before the loop execution.\n2. In every iteration of the loop:\nThe loop body reduces the value of `x` by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, the loop invariant `x >= 0` is true in every iteration of the loop.\n3. After the loop termination:\nThe loop terminates when `x` becomes 0. Therefore, the loop invariant `x == 0` is true after the loop termination.\n\nNow, let's combine these loop invariants into one code block:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant x == 10000;\n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant x == 0;\n*/\n```\nNote that the loop invariants are conjunctions of the conditions mentioned above. Also, the loop invariants are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination, respectively.\n\nFinally, we can use the loop invariants to verify the post-condition of the program, which is `x == 0`."

The assignment updates the value of `x` to be one less than its current value.\n\nThe loop condition is `x > 0`.\n\nTo find the loop invariants, we need to identify the variables that are updated in the loop body and the variables that are used in the loop condition. In this case, the only variable that is updated is `x`, and the only variable that is used in the loop condition is `x`.\n\nWe can start by identifying the loop invariant that is true before the loop execution. This invariant should capture the initial state of the loop, which is `x = 10000`. We can express this invariant as `x == 10000`.\n\nNext, we need to identify the loop invariant that is true in every iteration of the loop. This invariant should capture the relationship between the variables that are updated and the variables that are used in the loop condition. In this case, the loop invariant is `x > 0`.\n\nFinally, we need to identify the loop invariant that is true after the loop termination. This invariant should capture the final state of the loop, which is `x == 0`. We can express this invariant as `x == 0`.\n\nTo summarize, the loop invariants for the given program are:\n\n* `x == 10000` (before the loop execution)\n* `x > 0` (in every iteration of the loop)\n* `x == 0` (after the loop termination)\n\nWe can express these loop invariants in ACSL annotations for loops as follows:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant x == 10000;\n    loop invariant x > 0;\n    loop invariant x == 0;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used the `==` operator to compare the values of `x` in the loop invariants. This is because we are interested in checking whether the values of `x` are equal to a specific value, rather than checking whether the values of `x` are greater than or less than a specific value."
