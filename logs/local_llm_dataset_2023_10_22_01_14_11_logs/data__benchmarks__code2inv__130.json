Therefore, the possible values of `x1` are between 0 and 1, inclusive.\n\nSimilarly, the variable `x2` is initialized to 1 and is updated by subtracting `d2` in each iteration of the loop.

The variable `x3` is always greater than or equal to 0.\n\nWe can also identify additional loop invariants that bound the maximum and minimum values that the variables can take. For example, we can add the following loop invariants:\n\n1. The variable `x1` is always less than or equal to 1.\n2. The variable `x2` is always less than or equal to 1.\n3. The variable `x3` is always less than or equal to 1.\n\nFinally, we can use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. We can add the following loop invariants:\n\n1.
