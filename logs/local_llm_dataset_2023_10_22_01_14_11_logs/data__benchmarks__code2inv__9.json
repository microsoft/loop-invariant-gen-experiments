If the loop executes 1 or more times, then `x` and `y` will be increased by 2 in each iteration, and the post-condition will still be true.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the loop invariants are:\n```\nx >= 0\ny >= 0\n```\nThese invariants are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. They imply that `x` and `y` are non-negative, which is the post-condition.\n\nWe can also add conjunctions that bound the maximum and minimum values that `x` and `y` can take. Since `x` and `y` are initialized to 0, and the loop body increases their values by 2 in each iteration, we can conclude that the maximum values that `x` and `y` can take are 4 and 6, respectively. Therefore, we can add the following conjunctions:\n```\nx <= 4\ny <= 6\n```\nThese conjunctions are also true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. They bound the maximum values that `x` and `y` can take, which helps to strengthen the loop invariants.\n\nFinally, we can add conjunctions that relate the values of `x` and `y`. Since `x` and `y` are always increased by 2 in each iteration, we can conclude that `x` is always greater than or equal to `y`. Therefore, we can add the following conjunction:\n```\nx >= y\n```\nThis conjunction is also true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. It relates the values of `x` and `y`, which helps to strengthen the loop invariants.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the loop in the program above are:\n```\nx >= 0\ny >= 0\nx <= 4\ny <= 6\nx >= y\n```\nThese loop invariants are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. They imply that `x` and `y` are non-negative, and that `x` is always greater than or equal to `y`. These invariants help to strengthen the post-condition, and make it easier to verify that the loop terminates."
