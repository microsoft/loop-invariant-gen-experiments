This is because the `==` operator is used to compare the values of variables in ACSL annotations.\n\nAlso, note that we have used the `&&` operator to combine the loop invariants into a single annotation. This is because ACSL annotations can only contain a single invariant per line.\n\nFinally, we can use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. We can use the implication operator `==>` to express the loop invariants in a way that takes into account the conditional nature of the loop. For example, we can use the following code to express the loop invariants in a way that takes into account the conditional nature of the loop:\n```scss\n/*@ \n    loop invariant (sn == 0) ==> (x == 0 && sn == 0);\n    loop invariant (sn == 0) ==> (x == sn + 1);\n    loop invariant (sn == 0) ==> (x == sn);\n*/\n```\nThis code uses implication to express the loop invariants in a way that takes into account the conditional nature of the loop. The `==>` operator is used to express the implication of the loop invariants, and the `(sn == 0)` condition is used to specify the condition under which the loop invariants hold."

Therefore, the loop invariant `I1` can be defined as:\n```scss\nI1: unknown()\n```\nDuring the loop execution, the loop condition `unknown()` remains true, and the variables `x` and `sn` are incremented by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, the loop invariant `I2` can be defined as:\n```scss\nI2: x < sn && sn < x + 1\n```\nAfter the loop termination, the loop condition `unknown()` is false, which means that the loop has terminated. Therefore, the loop invariant `I3` can be defined as:\n```scss\nI3: !unknown()\n```\nThe post-condition of the program is that the variable `sn` is equal to the variable `x` after the loop termination. Therefore, we can use the implication `=>` to link the loop invariants to the post-condition:\n```scss\nI1 ==> I2 ==> I3 ==> sn == x\n```\nThe loop invariants `I1`, `I2`, and `I3` are necessary to verify the post-condition `sn == x`.\n\nNote that the variables `sn` and `x` are not initialized in the program, so we cannot make any assumptions about their initial values. However, we can use the loop invariants to bound the maximum and minimum values that they can take during the loop execution. For example, we can add the conjunction `sn >= 0 && sn <= x + 1` to the loop invariant `I2` to bound the value of `sn` between 0 and `x + 1`."
