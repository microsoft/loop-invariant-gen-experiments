The first if-else statement increments `x` and `y` by 1 and 2, respectively, if `unknown_int()` returns 1. The second if-else statement increments `x` by 1 and `y` by 3 if `unknown_int()` returns 2.\n* The loop condition is `unknown_int()`. This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as `unknown_int()` returns 1.\n\nNext, let's identify the loop invariants:\n\n* Before the loop execution, the variable `x` is initialized to 0, and the variable `y` is initialized to 0.\n* In every iteration of the loop, the variable `x` is incremented by 1, and the variable `y` is incremented by 2 or 3, depending on the value returned by `unknown_int()`.\n* After the loop termination, the variable `x` is greater than or equal to 3, and the variable `y` is greater than or equal to 6.\n\nNow, let's output the loop invariants:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant i1: x >= 0;\n    loop invariant i2: y >= 0;\n    loop invariant i3: x >= 3;\n    loop invariant i4: y >= 6;\n*/\n```\nIn this code block, we have defined four loop invariants: `i1`, `i2`, `i3`, and `i4`. The first two loop invariants ensure that the variables `x` and `y` are initialized to 0 before the loop execution. The third loop invariant ensures that the variable `x` is greater than or equal to 3 after the loop termination. The fourth loop invariant ensures that the variable `y` is greater than or equal to 6 after the loop termination.\n\nNote that we have split the loop invariants into their parts to make the code more readable. However, we could have also defined the loop invariants as a single conjunction, like this:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant i1 && i2 && i3 && i4;\n*/\n```\nIn this case, the loop invariants `i1`, `i2`, `i3`, and `i4` are combined using the conjunction operator `&&` to form a single loop invariant."
