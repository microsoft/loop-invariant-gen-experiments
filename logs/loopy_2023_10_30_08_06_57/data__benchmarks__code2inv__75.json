This means that `z` is always at least `36 * y` and at most `36 * y + 36`.\n- The third loop invariant reiterates the initial condition that `y` is always between 0 and 127, inclusive.\n- The fourth loop invariant specifies that `z` is always equal to `36 * y` plus the number of times the `if` statement inside the loop was executed. This is achieved by subtracting the previous value of `c` (which is `\\at(c, Pre)`) from the current value of `c`.\n- The fifth loop invariant specifies that if `c` is less than 36 (i.e., the loop is still executing), then `z` must be less than 4608.\n\nNote that we do not need to add any loop invariants to take care of the non-deterministic values of the variables at the beginning or end of the loop, since none of the variables are non-deterministic.",
