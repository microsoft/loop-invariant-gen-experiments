Since x and y are increased by 10 in each iteration, the maximum value they can take is 110. The minimum value is 0 because of the pre-conditions.\n- The third loop invariant ensures that for every value of y in the range [0, y), x is greater than 10. This is true because x is increased by 10 in each iteration and it starts at 0.\n- The fourth loop invariant establishes a relation between x and y. Since x is increased by 10 in each iteration and y is increased by 10 in each iteration, x is always less than or equal to y + 10.\n- The fifth loop invariant uses implication to take care of the conditional assertion. It says that if y is equal to 0, then x must be different from 20.",
            "First, let's analyze the loop body and the loop condition:\n```\n{\n    (x  = (x + 10));\n    (y  = (y + 10));\n}\nwhile (unknown())\n```\nThe loop condition is `unknown()`, which means we do not know when the loop will terminate. In other words, the loop can execute any number of times.\n\nNow, let's consider the pre-conditions and variable assignments:\n```\nint x;\nint y;\n\nassume((x >= 0));\nassume((x <= 10));\nassume((y <= 10));\nassume((y >= 0));\n```\nWe know that `x` and `y` are integers and are non-negative and less than or equal to 10.\n\nBased on the loop body, we can derive the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant (x >= 0) && (x <= 110);\n    loop invariant (y >= 0) && (y <= 110);\n*/\n```\nThe first loop invariant states that `x` is always non-negative and less than or equal to 110. This is derived from the fact that `x` is initialized to a non-negative value and then increased by 10 in each iteration of the loop. Since we do not know when the loop will terminate, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where the loop executes 11 times (because `x` is bounded above by 10 and each iteration increases `x` by 10, so `x` can be at most 110).\n\nSimilarly, the second loop invariant states that `y` is always non-negative and less than or equal to 110. This is also derived from the fact that `y` is initialized to a non-negative value and then increased by 10 in each iteration of the loop.\n\nNow, let's consider the assertion:\n```\nif ( (y == 0) )\n{;\n//@ assert( (x != 20) );\n}\n```\nThe assertion is guarded by the condition `(y == 0)`. So, we need to use this condition in an implication to derive the loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant (y != 0) ==> (x != 20);\n*/\n```\nThis loop invariant states that if `y` is not equal to 0, then `x` is not equal to 20. This is derived from the assertion that if `y` is equal to 0, then `x` cannot be equal to 20.\n\nFinally, we need to consider the fact that `unknown()` is non-deterministic, which means we do not know the values of `x` and `y` at the end of the loop. Therefore, we need to use an implication to make the loop invariant trivially true at the end of the loop:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant (unknown() == 0) ==> (x >= 0) && (x <= 110) && (y >= 0) && (y <= 110);\n*/\n```\nThis loop invariant states that if `unknown()` is equal to 0 (i.e., the loop terminates), then `x` and `y` are still within their bounds. This implication makes the loop invariant trivially true at the end of the loop when `unknown()` is equal to 0.\n\nPutting it all together, we have the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant (x >= 0) && (x <= 110);\n    loop invariant (y >= 0) && (y <= 110);\n    loop invariant (y != 0) ==> (x != 20);\n    loop invariant (unknown() == 0) ==> (x >= 0) && (x <= 110) && (y >= 0) && (y <= 110);\n*/\n```\nThese loop invariants are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination, and they imply the post-condition.",

Therefore, we do not have any loop invariants before the loop execution.\n- In every iteration of the loop, the values of x and y are incremented by 10. So, we can add the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant 0 <= x <= 110;\n    loop invariant 0 <= y <= 110;\n    loop invariant x % 10 == 0;\n    loop invariant y % 10 == 0;\n*/\n```\n- After the loop termination, we know that the loop condition is false, which means that unknown() is false. Therefore, we can assume that the loop did not execute and that the loop invariants are still true. We can use this assumption to make the post-condition a loop invariant. So, we can add the following loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant y != 0 ==> (x != 20);\n*/\n``` \n\nNote that we used the implication operator (==>) to take into account the conditional nature of the post-condition. We also used the modulo operator (%) to express that x and y are incremented by 10 in every iteration.
