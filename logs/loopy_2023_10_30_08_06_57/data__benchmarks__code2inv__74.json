This can be easily proven by induction. At the beginning of the loop, `c` is 0 and `z` is `36*y`.

We also know that `y` is non-negative and greater than or equal to 127. Therefore, `z` is greater than or equal to 36 * 127.\n- In every iteration of the loop, we know that if `c` is less than 36, then `z` is incremented by 1 and `c` is incremented by 1. Therefore, if `c` is less than 36, then `z` is greater than or equal to 36 * 127 + (c + 1).\n- After the loop termination, we know that either `c` is less than 36 or `c` is greater than or equal to 36. If `c` is less than 36, then we know that `z` is greater than or equal to 36 * 127 + 36 because `c` has been incremented to 36 in the loop.
