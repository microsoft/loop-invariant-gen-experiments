            "Pre-conditions:\n- x >= 0\n- x <= 10\n- y >= 0\n- y <= 10\n\nLoop condition:\n- unknown()\n\nPost-condition:\n- if x == 20, then y != 0\n\nWe can start by analyzing the loop body, which is a block containing two assignments. The assignments do not change any of the loop conditions, so we do not need to consider them in our loop invariants.\n\nLoop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant 0 <= x <= 20;\n  loop invariant 0 <= y <= 10;\n*/\n```\nExplanation: Since x is incremented by 10 in every iteration, it can take values from 0 to 20. Similarly, y is incremented by 10 in every iteration and can take values from 0 to 10. These invariants hold true before the loop execution, in every iteration, and after the loop termination.\n\nNext, we need to check if these loop invariants imply the post-condition. We need to consider the case when x == 20. If x == 20, then we know that x must have been incremented exactly twice in the loop. Therefore, the loop must have executed exactly twice. If the loop executed twice, then y must have been incremented by 20. Therefore, y != 0. We can express this implication as follows:\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant 0 <= x <= 20;\n  loop invariant 0 <= y <= 10;\n  requires x == 20;\n  assigns \\nothing;\n  ensures y != 0 ==> x == 20;\n*/\n```\nExplanation: We add a requires clause to capture the case when x == 20. We add an assigns clause to state that the loop body does not modify any variables. We add an ensures clause to express the implication between the loop invariants and the post-condition.\n\nFinally, we need to handle the non-deterministic behavior of the unknown function. We can add an additional loop invariant to handle this:\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant 0 <= x <= 20;\n  loop invariant 0 <= y <= 10;\n  loop invariant (unknown() ==> \\true);\n  requires x == 20;\n  assigns \\nothing;\n  ensures y != 0 ==> x == 20;\n*/\n```\nExplanation: We add a loop invariant that states that unknown() is true in every iteration. Since we do not know the behavior of unknown(), we can assume that it is true in order to make the invariant hold. This invariant is vacuously true if unknown() is always false. We keep the previous loop invariants and post-condition unchanged. \n\nTherefore, the final set of loop invariants is:\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant 0 <= x <= 20;\n  loop invariant 0 <= y <= 10;\n  loop invariant (unknown() ==> \\true);\n  requires x == 20;\n  assigns \\nothing;\n  ensures y != 0 ==> x == 20;\n*/\n```",
