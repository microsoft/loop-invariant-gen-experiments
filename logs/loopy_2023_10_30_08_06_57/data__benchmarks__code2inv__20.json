            "We are given a C program with a while loop and an assertion. We need to find the necessary loop invariants for Frama-C to verify the post-condition.

Since `m` is assigned the value of `x` only when `unknown()` returns a non-zero value, we need to show that `m` is always greater than or equal to 0. We can prove this by using implication. We know that `m` is initialized to 0 and is only assigned values of `x` that are greater than or equal to 0 (since `x` is always greater than or equal to 0). Therefore, we can say that `m >= 0` is true at the end of the loop if `x >= 0`.
