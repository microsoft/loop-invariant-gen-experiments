Therefore, if the loop condition is true, then `y` must be less than or equal to `i`.\n- `(x == 0) ==> (y == \\old(y) - \\old(x))`: This invariant holds after the loop termination. It states that if the loop condition is false (i.e., `x` is equal to 0), then `y` must be equal to its old value minus the old value of `x`. This is because within the loop, `y` is decreased by the same amount as `x`, and therefore, after the loop terminates, `y` must be equal to its old value minus the old value of `x`. \n- `(x == 0 && y != 0) ==> (i != j)`: This invariant holds after the loop termination, but only if `y` is not equal to 0. It states that if `x` is equal to 0 and `y` is not equal to 0, then `i` must not be equal to `j`. This is because within the loop, `i` and `j` are both initialized to the same value (`y`), and they both decrease by the same amount in each iteration. Therefore, if `y` is not equal to 0 after the loop, then `i` and `j` must have different values",
