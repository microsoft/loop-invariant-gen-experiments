            "We can start by analyzing the pre-conditions and variable assignments in the program:\n\n- `x` and `y` are integer variables that are initialized to some unknown values.\n- `z1`, `z2`, and `z3` are integer variables that are never used in the program.\n- The pre-conditions are:\n  - `x >= 0`\n  - `x <= 2`\n  - `y >= 0`\n  - `y <= 2`\n\nNext, we can analyze the loop body:\n\n- The loop body contains a block of code that increments `x` and `y` by 2.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can come up with the following loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant 0 <= x <= 4;\n  loop invariant 0 <= y <= 4;\n*/\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- The loop invariant `0 <= x <= 4` is true before the loop execution because `x` is initialized to some value between 0 and 2, and the loop body increments `x` by 2 each time. Therefore, `x` can never be greater than 4.\n- The loop invariant `0 <= y <= 4` is true before the loop execution for the same reason as above.\n- The loop invariants are true in every iteration of the loop because the loop body only increments `x` and `y` by 2, which does not violate the bounds specified in the loop invariants.\n- The loop invariants are also true after the loop termination because the loop condition is unknown, so we cannot assume anything about the final values of `x` and `y`. However, we know that the loop invariants hold at the end of each iteration, so they must hold after the loop termination as well.\n- The loop invariants imply the post-condition because if `x == 4`, then `0 <= y <= 4` implies that `y` is not equal to 0, which is the assertion in the post-condition. Note that we do not need to use the guard condition of the assertion because the loop invariant already implies the assertion.",

This is because x and y are incremented by 2 in each iteration, and they both start with even numbers according to the pre-conditions.\n- The third loop invariant specifies that if x equals 4 after the loop, then y must not be equal to 0. This is the post-condition of the program, which is guarded by the implication.\n- The last two loop invariants handle the non-deterministic values of x and y. They use the \\at notation to refer to the values of x and y in the previous iteration (Pre). If x is not equal to 4 in the current iteration and y is 0, then x must be different from its previous value to satisfy the first loop invariant.

This is true because both x and y are incremented by 2 at each iteration. \n\nThe fourth loop invariant states that if y is zero, then x is less than or equal to 2. This is true because x starts at a value between 0 and 2, and is incremented by 2 at each iteration, so it can never exceed 4. \n\nThe fifth loop invariant states that if x is 4, then y is not zero. This is the same as the post-condition. \n\nThe sixth loop invariant states that if the loop terminates, then x is 4. This is because the loop condition is unknown(), which means that the loop will terminate when the condition is false. If the loop terminates, then x must be equal to 4. \n\nNote that we did not need to use any non-deterministic functions or make any assumptions about the values of the variables.",
