            "First, let's make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program:\n- The variable `n` is not initialized.\n- The variable `x` is initialized to 0.\n- The variable `m` is initialized to 0.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition:\n- The loop condition is `x < n`.\n- The loop body has an if condition that assigns the value of `x` to `m` if an unknown function returns true.\n\nNext, let's output the loop invariants:\n- Before the loop execution, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, since it is initialized to 0.\n- Before the loop execution, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, since it is initialized to 0.\n- Before the loop execution, `n` can take any value since it is not initialized, so we cannot make any assumptions about it.\n- In every iteration of the loop, `x` is strictly increasing, since its value is incremented by 1.\n- In every iteration of the loop, `m` is less than or equal to `x`, since `m` is only assigned the value of `x` in the if condition.\n- After the loop termination, `x` is greater than or equal to `n`, since the loop terminates when `x` is no longer less than `n`.\n- After the loop termination, `m` is less than `n`, since the assertion checks that `m` is less than `n` only if `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, we can use an implication to make this invariant true after the loop termination:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant m >= 0;\n    loop invariant x >= n ==> m < n;\n    loop invariant x <= n ==> x < n;\n*/\n```\n\nNote that we used implications to handle the conditional nature of the code. The first implication handles the case where `x` is greater than or equal to `n`, which implies that `m` is less than `n`. The second implication handles the case where `x` is less than or equal to `n`, which implies that `x` is less than `n`. We also used the relation between `x` and `m` to write the loop invariant for `m` in every iteration of the loop. Finally, we used an implication to make the invariant for `m` true after the loop termination.",
            "Pre-conditions:\n- The variable `n` is not initialized and contains garbage value.\n\nLoop condition:\n- The loop executes while `x` is less than `n`.\n\nLoop invariants:\n- Before the loop: Since `x` is initialized to 0, we have `0 <= x`. Since `m` is initialized to 0, we have `0 <= m`. Since `n` contains garbage value, we can only assume `n >= 0`. Thus, the following loop invariants hold before the loop:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= x;\n    loop invariant 0 <= m;\n    loop invariant n >= 0;\n*/\n```\n- In every iteration: The loop body has two cases. In the first case, if `unknown()` returns true, then `m` is assigned the value of `x`. This means that `m` is at least as large as `x` at the end of the iteration. In the second case, `m` remains unchanged, so it is still at least as large as its previous value. Since `x` is incremented by 1, we have `x >= \\old(x) + 1`. Since `m` is non-negative, we have `m >= \\old(m)`. Thus, the following loop invariants hold in every iteration:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant m >= \\old(m);\n    loop invariant x >= \\old(x) + 1 ==> m >= \\old(x);\n*/\n```\n- After the loop: The loop terminates when `x` is greater than or equal to `n`. Since `m` is assigned the value of `x` only when `unknown()` returns true, it can be at most as large as `n-1`. Thus, the following loop invariant holds after the loop:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= n ==> m <= n-1;\n*/\n```\n- Implication for non-deterministic values: Since the value of `n` is non-deterministic at the beginning of the loop, we can use the following implication to make the loop invariants trivially true at that location:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant n <= 0 ==> (0 <= x && 0 <= m);\n*/\n```\nSince the assertion is guarded by `n > 0`, we can use the following implication:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= n ==> (n > 0 ==> m < n);\n*/\n```\n\nTherefore, the complete set of loop invariants is:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= x;\n    loop invariant 0 <= m;\n    loop invariant n >= 0;\n    loop invariant m >= \\old(m);\n    loop invariant x >= \\old(x) + 1 ==> m >= \\old(x);\n    loop invariant x >= n ==> m <= n-1;\n    loop invariant n <= 0 ==> (0 <= x && 0 <= m);\n    loop invariant x >= n ==> (n > 0 ==> m < n);\n*/\n```",
