            "We start by analyzing the program and identifying its pre-conditions and variable assignments:\n\nPre-conditions:\n- `n > 0`\n\nVariable Assignments:\n- `c = 0`\n- `c = c + 1` (inside if statement)\n- `c = 1` (inside else statement)\n\nNext, we analyze the loop body and identify the loop condition:\n- `while (unknown())`\n\nNow, we can start finding loop invariants:\n- Before the loop execution, `c >= 0 && c <= n`\n- In every iteration of the loop, `(c == 0 || c > 0) && (c == n || c < n)`\n- After the loop termination, `(c >= 0 && c <= n) ==> (c == n)`\n\nLet's break down each of these loop invariants:\n- Before the loop execution, we know that `c` is initialized to 0 and `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, `c` is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to `n`.\n- In every iteration of the loop, `c` can either be 0 or greater than 0, and it can either be equal to `n` or less than `n`. This holds true because `c` is incremented only when `(c != n)` and set to 1 only when `(c == n)`. Therefore, `c` can never be less than 0 or greater than `n`.\n- After the loop termination, we know that if `c` is within the bounds of 0 and `n`, then it must be equal to `n`. This is because `c` is incremented only when `(c != n)` and set to 1 only when `(c == n)`. Therefore, if the loop terminates normally and `c` is within the bounds, then `c` must be equal to `n`.\n\nPutting it all together, we get the following loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant c >= 0 && c <= n;\n  loop invariant (c == 0 || c > 0) && (c == n || c < n);\n  loop invariant \\forall int k; 0 <= k <= c ==> k != n;\n  loop invariant (c >= 0 && c <= n) ==> (c == n);\n*/\n```\n\nNote that we added an additional loop invariant to express that all integers from 0 to `c` (inclusive) are not equal to `n`. This is because `c` is incremented only when `(c != n)` and set to 1 only when `(c == n)`. Therefore, all integers from 0 to `c` (inclusive) are guaranteed to be not equal to `n`.",
            "First, let's note the pre-conditions and variable assignments in the program:\n- The variable `n` is assumed to be greater than 0.\n- The variables `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` are not used and can be ignored.\n- The variable `c` is initialized to 0.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition:\n- The loop condition is `unknown()`, which means that we do not know how many times the loop will execute.\n\nNext, let's find the necessary loop invariants:\n- Before the loop execution, `c` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to `n`.\n- In every iteration of the loop, `c` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to `n`.\n- After the loop termination, `c` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to `n`, and if `(c < 0) || (c > n)` is false, then `(c == n)`.\n\nLet's break down each of these loop invariants:\n- Before the loop execution, `c` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to `n`:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant 0 <= c <= n; */\n```\n\n- In every iteration of the loop, `c` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to `n`:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant 0 <= c <= n; */\n```\n\n- After the loop termination, `c` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to `n`, and if `(c < 0) || (c > n)` is false, then `(c == n)`:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant 0 <= c <= n;\n    loop invariant (c < 0) || (c > n) || (c == n); */\n```\nNote that we use implication to handle the conditional statement in the assertion. If `(c < 0) || (c > n)` is true, then the assertion is trivially true, so we do not need to worry about it. If `(c < 0) || (c > n)` is false, then `(c == n)` must be true for the assertion to hold.",
