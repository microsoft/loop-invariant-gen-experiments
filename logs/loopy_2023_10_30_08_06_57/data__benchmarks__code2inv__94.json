This is true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop. After the loop termination, i = n+1, so the invariant is still true.\n- The second loop invariant ensures that j is always equal to (i * (i - 1))/2. This is true before the loop execution (since i is initially 0 and j is initially 0) and in every iteration of the loop (since j is incremented by i in each iteration). After the loop termination, i = n+1 and j = (n * (n+1))/2, so the invariant is still true.\n- The third loop invariant is the most complex one. It ensures that the assertion holds true at every point in the loop. We can see that (i-1) + ((j-((i-1)*i/2)) + k) is equal to (i-1) + (j - (i*(i-1))/2 + k), which simplifies to i*(i-1)/2 + j + k. So the loop invariant ensures that i*(i-1)/2 + j + k is always greater than 2*(i-1), which implies that (i + (j + k)) > (2 * n). This is true before the loop execution (since i is initially 0 and j is initially 0), in every iteration of the loop (since i and j are incremented by 1 and i, respectively) and after the loop termination (since i = n+1 and j = (n * (n+1))/2). \n\nNote that we didn't need to use any non-deterministic function calls or the \\at(x, Pre) notation for any variable x. Also, we used implication to handle the conditional nature of the code. We added conjunctions that bound the maximum and minimum values that each variable can take.

Hence, it is also an invariant.\n- After the loop termination:\n    - i > n as i <= n + 1 is true before the last iteration and i is incremented in every iteration.\n    - (i + j + k) > 2n as the loop terminates when i > n and j == (n * (n + 1)) / 2. Hence, (i + j + k) > (n + n(n+1)/2) > 2n. Here, we have used the fact that k >= 0 and the sum of first n natural numbers is n(n+1)/2. \n\nNote: Since there are no non-deterministic variables, we do not need to use implication to make the invariants trivially true at any location.",

Hence, the maximum value of i at the end of the loop is n+1.\n- j <= (n + 1) * (n + 2) / 2 is an invariant because j is incremented by i in each iteration and the maximum value of i is n+1. Hence, the maximum value of j at the end of the loop can be calculated as the sum of the first (n+1) positive integers.\n- i + j > i and i + j > j are invariants because i and j are incremented in each iteration of the loop and their sum is increased by at least 1 in each iteration. Hence, their sum is always greater than either i or j.\n- i + j > 2 * (i - 1) is an invariant because i is incremented by 1 in each iteration and j is incremented by i. Hence, in the ith iteration, the value of j is at least i and the value of i is at least i-1. Therefore, their sum is at least 2*(i-1).\n- i + j > 2 * (j - i) is an invariant because i is incremented by 1 in each iteration and j is incremented by i. Hence, in the ith iteration, the value of j is at least i and the value of i is at most i-1. Therefore, their difference is at most j-i and their sum is at least 2*(j-i).\n- i + j + k > 2 * n ==> (i > n) || (j > (n + 1) * (n + 2) / 2 - i - k) is an invariant because the post-condition is guarded by the condition i + j + k > 2 * n. If i <= n, then the sum i + j + k is at most 2n and the implication is trivially true. Otherwise, i > n and we need to show that j > (n + 1) * (n + 2) / 2 - i - k. Since j is incremented by i in each iteration, the sum of the first i positive integers is less than or equal to j. Therefore, j > (i-1)*i/2 and i + j + k > 2 * n implies that (i-1)*i/2 + i + k > 2 * n. This can be simplified to i^2 + i - 2n + 2k > 0. The discriminant of this quadratic equation is 1 + 8n - 8k, which is always non-negative because k >= 0 and n >= 0. Hence, the quadratic equation has two real roots and we can choose the positive root to obtain the inequality i > (-1 + sqrt(1 + 8n - 8k))/2. Therefore, j > (i-1)*i/2 > (n+1)*(n+2)/2 - i - k, which proves the implication.",
