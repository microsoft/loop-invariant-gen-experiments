            "Pre-conditions:\n- The program does not take any input.\n- The variable `x` is initialized to 0.\n- The variables `y` and `z` are uninitialized and may contain garbage values.\n\nLoop condition:\n- The loop continues as long as `x` is less than 500.\n\nLoop invariants:\n- Before the loop execution, `y` is greater than or equal to `z`.\n- In every iteration of the loop, `y` remains greater than or equal to `z`.\n- After the loop termination, `z` is greater than or equal to `y`, which implies that `z >= y`.\n\nExplanation:\n- Before the loop starts, `y` and `z` are uninitialized and can contain garbage values. Therefore, we cannot make any assumptions about their values. However, we can assume that `y` is greater than or equal to `z` because we have not yet encountered any code that assigns a value to `y` or `z`.\n- In every iteration of the loop, `x` is incremented by 1, so it becomes greater than or equal to its initial value of 0. Therefore, `x` is always greater than or equal to 0 in every iteration of the loop. \n- Inside the loop, there is an if statement that checks whether `z` is less than or equal to `y`. If this condition is true, then `y` is assigned the value of `z`. Therefore, if the condition is true, then `y` becomes equal to or less than `z`. However, if the condition is false, then `y` remains greater than or equal to `z`. Therefore, we can combine these two cases using implication: `y >= z ==> y' >= z'` where `y'` and `z'` represent the values of `y` and `z` after the loop iteration.\n- After the loop terminates, `x` is greater than or equal to 500. Since `x` is incremented by 1 in every iteration of the loop, this means that the loop executes at most 500 times. Therefore, when the loop terminates, `y` is greater than or equal to `z` and `x` is greater than or equal to 500. Since the assertion `z >= y` is guarded by the condition `x >= 500`, we can use implication: `x >= 500 ==> z >= y`.\n\nPutting it all together, the loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant y >= z;\n    loop invariant \\forall integer i; 0 <= i < x ==> y >= z;\n    loop invariant x >= 500 ==> z >= y;\n*/\n```",
            "First, let's analyze the program and note down the pre-conditions and variable assignments:\n- The program defines a macro `assume` which takes a boolean expression and returns 0 if it evaluates to false.\n- The main function initializes two integer variables `x` and `y` to 0 and declares another integer variable `z` without initialization.\n- The program enters a while loop as long as `x` is less than 500.\n- Within the loop, `x` is incremented by 1 and there is a conditional statement with the condition `z <= y`. If the condition is true, `y` is assigned the value of `z`.\n- Outside the loop, the program has an assertion that `z` is greater than or equal to `y`.\n\nNow let's find the necessary loop invariants for the while loop:\n- Before the loop execution:\n    - `x >= 0`\n    - `y <= z`\n    - `z` can be any integer value\n- In every iteration of the loop:\n    - `x > 0`\n    - `y <= z`\n    - If the condition `z <= y` is true, then `y = z`\n- After the loop termination, we need to prove that `z >= y` which implies:\n    - `x >= 500 ==> z >= y`\n\nPutting it all together, the loop invariants for the while loop are:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant x >= 0 && y <= z;\n    loop invariant x > 0 && y <= z;\n    loop invariant x < 500 ==> (z <= y ==> y == \\old(y));\n    loop invariant x >= 500 ==> z >= y;\n*/\n```\n\nNote that for the third invariant, we used implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code.
