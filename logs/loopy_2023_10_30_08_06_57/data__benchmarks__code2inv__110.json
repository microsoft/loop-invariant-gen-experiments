Given a program, you can find loop invariants, which can then be used to verify some property in the program. \nFrama-C is a software verification tool for C programs. The input to Frama-C is a C program file with ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations.\nFor the given program, find the necessary loop invariants of the while loop to help Frama-C verify the post-condition.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. \n- Output loop invariants that are true \n(i) before the loop execution, \n(ii) in every iteration of the loop and \n(iii) after the loop termination, \nsuch that the loop invariants imply the post condition.\n- If a loop invariant is a conjunction, split it into its parts.\n- Output all the loop invariants in one code block. For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values. Do not use variables that have garbage values.**\n- **Do not use keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops.**\n- **Variables that are not explicitly initialized, could have garbage values.

            "Pre-conditions/Variable assignments:\n- The program defines a macro `assume(e)` which returns 0 if the condition `e` is not true.\n- The program defines three integer variables `i`, `n`, and `sn`.\n- `sn` and `i` are assigned 0 and 1 respectively.\n\nLoop Condition:\n- The while loop will execute as long as `i <= n`.\n\nLoop Invariants:\n- Since `n` is not initialized, we cannot use it in the loop invariant. We will assume that `n > 0`.\n\n1. Before the loop execution:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 1: sn == 0;\n    loop invariant 2: i >= 1;\n*/\n```\nExplanation: \n- `sn` is initialized to 0 before the loop and we know that no operation inside the loop changes its value. Hence, `sn` must be equal to 0 before the loop.\n- `i` is initialized to 1 before the loop and we know that the loop condition requires that `i` is greater than or equal to 1. Hence, `i` must be greater than or equal to 1 before the loop.\n\n2. In every iteration of the loop:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 1: sn == (i - 1);\n    loop invariant 2: i <= n + 1;\n*/\n```\nExplanation:\n- After each iteration of the loop, `i` is incremented by 1 and `sn` is incremented by 1 as well. Hence, `sn` will always be equal to `i-1` inside the loop.\n- Since the loop condition requires that `i` is less than or equal to `n`, `i` can take a maximum value of `n` and then the loop will terminate. Hence, `i` must be less than or equal to `n+1` inside the loop.\n\n3.

Hence, `sn` must be less than or equal to `n`.\n- Since `sn` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop and `sn` starts from 0, `sn` must be greater than or equal to 0.\n- If `sn` is equal to `n` after the loop, it means that the loop executed `n` times and `i` was incremented `n` times, so `i` must be equal to `n+1`. Hence, `sn = n` implies `i = n+1`.\n- `i` must be greater than or equal to 1 after the loop, as `i` starts from 1 and can only be incremented inside the loop. \n\nFinal Assertion:\n- The assertion is guarded by a condition `sn != n`. Hence, we will use implication to make the invariant trivially true when `sn != n`.\n```\nif (sn != n) {\n  /*@ assert (sn <= n);*/\n} else {\n  /*@ assert (sn == n ==> i == n + 1); */\n  /*@ assert (sn >= 0); */\n  /*@ assert (sn <= n); */\n  /*@ assert (i >= 1); */\n}\n```\nExplanation:\n- When `sn != n`, `sn` can take any value less than or equal to `n`. Hence, the invariant `sn <= n` holds.\n- When `sn == n`, the loop executed `n` times and `i` was incremented `n` times, so `i` must be equal to `n+1`. Hence, the invariant `sn == n ==> i == n + 1` holds.\n- The invariant `sn >= 0` holds regardless of the value of `sn`.\n- The invariant `sn <= n` holds regardless of the value of `sn`.\n- The invariant `i >= 1` holds regardless of the value of `i`.",

This is because the loop adds 1 to `sn` in each iteration, so if `i` is greater than `n`, then `sn` should be equal to `n` for the sum to be correct.

This invariant handles the case where the loop terminates early (i.e., `sn` becomes 0 before `i` reaches `n+1`). \n- The loop invariants together imply the post-condition, since if `sn` is not equal to `n`, then either `sn` is less than `n` or `sn` is greater than `n`.
