The input to Frama-C is a C program file with ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations.\nFor the given program, find the necessary loop invariants of the while loop to help Frama-C verify the post-condition.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. \n- Output loop invariants that are true \n(i) before the loop execution, \n(ii) in every iteration of the loop and \n(iii) after the loop termination, \nsuch that the loop invariants imply the post condition.\n- If a loop invariant is a conjunction, split it into its parts.\n- Output all the loop invariants in one code block.

Since y is always >= 1, x will decrease in every iteration. Therefore, x < 0 holds. Also, y is updated by adding 1 to it, so y >= 1.\n- After the loop termination, x >= 0 holds because x can only increase or stay the same in every iteration of the loop. y >= 1 holds because y is always incremented by 1 in every iteration of the loop. The assertion (y > 0) ==> (x >= 0) holds because if y > 0, then at least one iteration of the loop must have been executed, and in that iteration, x was decreased by y. Therefore, x must be greater than or equal to 0 after the loop terminates.\n\nNote that we did not need to add any implication to make the loop invariants hold, because all variables are assigned initial values and their values are updated inside the loop.",

Therefore, their sum is also non-negative.\n- In every iteration of the loop, y is strictly increasing because it is incremented by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, the current value of y is strictly greater than its previous value.\n- After the loop termination, y is positive because the loop terminates only when x becomes non-negative, which means that at least one iteration of the loop must have been executed and y must have been incremented at least once.

The assertion is guarded by the condition x >= 0, which means that it holds only when x becomes non-negative. Therefore, we add an implication that if x is non-negative, then y must be positive.
