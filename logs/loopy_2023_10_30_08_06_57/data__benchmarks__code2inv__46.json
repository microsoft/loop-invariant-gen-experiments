This is because `c` can only be incremented up to `n-1`, so if `c` is already equal to `n`, then `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.\n- `(c != n) ==> (c < n)`: If `c` is not equal to `n`, then it must be strictly less than `n`. This is because `c` can only be incremented up to `n-1`.\n- `(c != n) ==> (n > 1)`: If `c` is not equal to `n`, then `n` must be greater than 1. This is because if `n` is equal to 1, then `c` can only be equal to 1 and the loop would have terminated already.\n- `(c == n) || (c != n)`: Either `c` is equal to `n` or `c` is not equal to `n`. This is a tautology that simply states that one of the two conditions must always hold true.\n\nUsing these loop invariants, we can verify that the post-condition `c <= n` holds true after the loop terminates. Note that the assertion is not guarded by any condition, so we do not need to use any implication.",
