The input to Frama-C is a C program file with ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations.\nFor the given program, find the necessary loop invariants of the while loop to help Frama-C verify the post-condition.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. \n- Output loop invariants that are true \n(i) before the loop execution, \n(ii) in every iteration of the loop and \n(iii) after the loop termination, \nsuch that the loop invariants imply the post condition.\n- If a loop invariant is a conjunction, split it into its parts.\n- Output all the loop invariants in one code block. For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values.

Also, the program assumes that `n` is greater than 0, so the maximum value of `c` is `n`. Therefore, the conjunction `c >= 0 && c <= n` is true before the loop execution.\n- In every iteration of the loop: The first conjunct `(c == n ==> c' == 1)` specifies that if `c` is equal to `n`, then `c'` (the value of `c` at the end of the iteration) should be reset to 1. The second conjunct `(c != n ==> c' == c+1)` specifies that if `c` is not equal to `n`, then `c'` should be incremented by 1. The third conjunct `c' >= 0 && c' <= n` specifies that the value of `c` at the end of the iteration should be between 0 and `n`, inclusive.\n- After the loop termination: The program checks whether `c` is equal to `n`. If it is, then the assertion `c <= n` should hold. Therefore, the implication `(c == n) ==> (c <= n)` is true after the loop termination.\n\nNote: Since `unknown()` is a non-deterministic function, we cannot make any assumptions about the value of `c` at the beginning or end of the loop. Therefore, we don't need to add any additional implications to handle non-determinism.",

The third loop invariant uses implication to state that if `c` is equal to `n` at the end of the loop, then `c` must be less than or equal to `n`.

The first invariant is true before the loop execution since `c` is initialized to `0` and the assumption is that `n` is greater than `0`.
