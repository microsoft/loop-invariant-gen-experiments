            "Pre-conditions:\n\n- None.\n\nVariable assignments:\n\n- `x` is assigned the value of `y`.\n- `lock` is assigned the value `1`.\n\nLoop condition:\n\n- The loop continues as long as `x` is not equal to `y`.\n\nLoop invariants:\n\n- `lock` is either `0` or `1` at the beginning of each iteration of the loop. This is because the only assignments to `lock` in the loop are `lock = 1` and `lock = 0`. Therefore, `lock` can only take the values `0` or `1`.\n- `x` is equal to `y` at the beginning of the first iteration of the loop. This is because `x` is assigned the value of `y` before the loop, and the loop condition checks for `x != y`. Therefore, the first iteration of the loop will only execute if `x == y`.\n- If `lock` is `1` at the beginning of an iteration of the loop, then `x` is equal to `y` at the end of that iteration. This is because the only assignment to `x` in the loop, when `lock == 1`, is `x = y`. Therefore, if `lock == 1` at the beginning of an iteration, then `x` will be equal to `y` at the end of that iteration.\n- If `lock` is `0` at the beginning of an iteration of the loop, then `y` is one more than its previous value at the end of that iteration. This is because the only assignment to `y` in the loop, when `lock == 0`, is `y = y + 1`. Therefore, if `lock == 0` at the beginning of an iteration, then `y` will be one more than its previous value at the end of that iteration.\n- `x` is always less than or equal to `y` throughout the loop. This is because `x` is only assigned the value of `y` or a value larger than `y` (which is `y + 1`), and `y` is only assigned a value larger than its previous value (when `lock == 0`). Therefore, `x` is always less than or equal to `y`.\n- The loop terminates. This is because the loop condition checks for `x != y`, and `x` is only assigned the value of `y` or a value larger than `y` (which is `y + 1`). Therefore, `x` can only be greater than `y` a finite number of times, and eventually `x` will be equal to `y` and the loop will terminate.\n\nPutting it all together, the loop invariants are:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant lock == 0 || lock == 1;\n    loop invariant x == y || \\old(x != y);\n    loop invariant lock == 1 ==> x == y;\n    loop invariant lock == 0 ==> y == \\old(y) + 1;\n    loop invariant x <= y;\n    loop invariant x == y || lock == 0;\n*/\n\nwhile ((x != y)) {\n    {\n      lock == 1 ==> (x = y);\n      lock == 0 ==> (y = \\old(y) + 1);\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\nNote that the loop invariants are written in the order in which they were derived.",
            "First, let's identify the pre-conditions and variable assignments:\n- The program does not have any pre-conditions.\n- The program declares three integer variables `lock`, `x`, and `y`.\n- `x` and `y` are assigned the same value in the beginning.\n- `lock` is assigned the value 1 in the beginning.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body and the loop condition:\n- The loop condition is `(x != y)`.\n- The loop body is an if-else statement that modifies the values of `lock`, `x`, and `y` based on the output of the function `unknown()`. \n\nTo find the necessary loop invariants, we need to identify properties that hold true:\n(i) before the loop execution, \n(ii) in every iteration of the loop, and \n(iii) after the loop termination.\n\nHere are some possible loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \nloop invariant lock == 0 || lock == 1; // lock can only be 0 or 1\nloop invariant x <= y + 1; // x is either equal to y or y + 1\nloop invariant y >= \\old(y); // y is non-decreasing\nloop invariant y <= x + 1; // y is either equal to x or x + 1\nloop invariant (lock == 1) ==> (x == y); // if lock is 1, then x must be equal to y\nloop invariant (x != y) ==> (lock == 0); // if x is not equal to y, then lock must be 0\nloop invariant (x == y) ==> ((lock == 0) || (lock == 1)); // if x is equal to y, then lock can be either 0 or 1\nloop invariant \\forall int i; (i >= \\old(y) && i < y) ==> unknown() == 0; // unknown() is always 0 between old(y) and y\nloop invariant \\forall int i; (i >= \\old(y) && i < y) ==> (x == i); // x is always equal to some value between old(y) and y\nloop invariant \\forall int i; (i >= \\old(y) && i < y) ==> (lock == 1); // lock is always equal to 1 between old(y) and y\n*/\n```\n\nLet's explain each of these loop invariants:\n- `lock` can only be 0 or 1, which is true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop.\n- `x` is either equal to `y` or `y + 1`. This is true before the loop execution since `x` is initially assigned the value of `y`. In every iteration of the loop, `x` is either set to `y` or `y + 1`.\n- `y` is non-decreasing, which is true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop. This is because `y` is either incremented by 1 or set to its current value.\n- `y` is either equal to `x` or `x + 1`. This is true before the loop execution since `x` is initially assigned the value of `y`. In every iteration of the loop, `y` is either set to `x` or `x + 1`.\n- If `lock` is 1, then `x` must be equal to `y`. This is true before the loop execution since `x` is initially assigned the value of `y`. In every iteration of the loop, `x` is either set to `y` or `y + 1`, but if `lock` is 1, then `x` must be equal to `y`.\n- If `x` is not equal to `y`, then `lock` must be 0. This is true in every iteration of the loop since `lock` is set to 0 when `x` is not equal to `y`.\n- If `x` is equal to `y`, then `lock` can be either 0 or 1. This is true in every iteration of the loop since `lock` can be set to either 0 or 1 when `x` is equal to `y`.\n- `unknown()` is always 0 between `old(y)` and `y`. This is true in every iteration of the loop since `unknown()` is only called inside the loop and `y` is non-decreasing.\n- `x` is always equal to some value between `old(y)` and `y`. This is true in every iteration of the loop since `x` is either set to `y` or `y + 1`, and `y` is non-decreasing.\n- `lock` is always equal to 1",

Therefore, `lock == 1 ==> x == y` is true.\n- When `lock` is 0, the assignment `(y = (y + 1))` is executed, which increases the value of `y`. Thus, `y` is always greater than its value at the beginning of the loop (`\\at(y, Loop_Entry)`). Therefore, `lock == 0 ==> y > \\at(y, Loop_Entry)` is true.\n- When `lock` is 0, `x` is assigned the value of `y`. Thus, `x` must be less than `y` to satisfy the loop condition.
