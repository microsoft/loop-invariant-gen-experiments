            "We first note the pre-conditions and variable assignments in the program:\n- The program assumes the existence of a function `unknown()` that returns a non-deterministic value.\n- The program defines integer variables `z1`, `z2`, `z3`, `x`, `m`, and `n`.\n- The variable `x` is initialized to 1.\n- The variable `m` is initialized to 1.\n- There is no explicit initialization of the variable `n`, so it may contain garbage values.\n\nNext, we analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition:\n- The loop condition is `x < n`.\n\nTo find necessary loop invariants, we need to analyze the program and its assertions to determine what conditions must be true at certain points in the program. Here are some possible loop invariants for the while loop:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 1 <= x <= n;\n    loop invariant 1 <= m <= x;\n*/\n```\nExplanation:\n- Loop invariant 1: Since `x` starts at 1 and is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, it is always greater than or equal to 1. Since `n` may contain garbage values, we cannot determine an upper bound for `x`. However, we know that the loop terminates when `x` becomes greater than or equal to `n`. Therefore, `x` is always less than or equal to `n`.\n- Loop invariant 2: `m` is initialized to 1 and may be updated to `x` if the condition `unknown()` is true. Since `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, we know that `m` is always less than or equal to `x`.\n\nFinally, we need to verify that the loop invariants imply the post-condition. The post-condition is an assertion that `m` is greater than or equal to 1 if `n` is greater than 1. We can use implication to handle the conditional nature of the code:\n```\n{;\n    //@ assert n <= 1 || m >= 1;\n}\n```\nExplanation:\n- If `n` is less than or equal to 1, then the assertion is trivially true, since the loop is never executed and `m` is equal to 1.\n- If `n` is greater than 1, then we know from loop invariant 2 that `m` is greater than or equal to 1.\n\nTherefore, the final program with loop invariants and the post-condition assertion is:\n```\n#define assume(e) if(!(e)) return 0;\nextern int unknown(void);\n\nint main()\n{\n    int z1,z2,z3;\n    int x = 1;\n    int m = 1;\n    int n;\n\n    //@ loop invariant 1 <= x <= n;\n    //@ loop invariant 1 <= m <= x;\n    while (x < n) {\n        if (unknown()) {\n            m = x;\n        }\n        x = x + 1;\n    }\n\n    {;\n        //@ assert n <= 1 || m >= 1;\n    }\n}\n```",
            "Pre-conditions:\n- The function `unknown()` returns a non-deterministic value.\n\nVariable Assignments:\n- `x` is initialized to `1`.\n- `m` is initialized to `1`.\n- `n` is uninitialized.\n\nLoop Condition:\n- The loop executes while `x < n`.\n\nLoop Invariants:\n- Before the loop execution, `x` is greater than or equal to `1`.\n```\n/*@ loop invariant x >= 1;\n*/\n```\n\n- Before the loop execution, `m` is greater than or equal to `1`.\n```\n/*@ loop invariant m >= 1;\n*/\n```\n\n- In every iteration of the loop, `x` is strictly increasing.\n```\n/*@ loop invariant x >= 1;\n    loop invariant \\forall integer i; 1 <= i < x ==> \\at(m, Pre) < i ==> \\at(m, Here) < i;\n*/\n```\n\n- After the loop termination, `m` is greater than or equal to `1`.\n```\n/*@ loop invariant x >= 1;\n    loop invariant m >= 1;\n    loop invariant \\forall integer i; 1 <= i < x ==> \\at(m, Pre) < i ==> \\at(m, Here) < i;\n    loop invariant x >= n ==> (m >= 1);\n*/\n```\nThe last loop invariant uses implication to take care of the conditional nature of the assertion. If `x >= n`, then the loop did not execute and `m` is already greater than or equal to `1`.
