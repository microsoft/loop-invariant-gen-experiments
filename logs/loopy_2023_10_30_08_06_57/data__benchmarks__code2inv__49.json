            "**Step 1: Pre-conditions and variable assignments**\n\nThe program initializes two integer variables `c` and `n`. The value of `c` is set to 0 and the value of `n` is unknown. The program then assumes that `n` is greater than 0.\n\n**Step 2: Loop condition**\n\nThe loop condition is `unknown()`. Since `unknown()` returns a non-deterministic value, we cannot reason about the exact number of loop iterations.\n\n**Step 3: Loop invariants**\n\nLet's try to find loop invariants that hold true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nBefore the loop execution:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant n > 0;\n    loop invariant c >= 0 && c <= n;\n*/\n```\nExplanation: Since `n` is assumed to be greater than 0, it holds true before the loop execution. The value of `c` is initialized to 0, so it is greater than or equal to 0. Since `c` is updated inside the loop, we need to ensure that `c` is always less than or equal to `n`.\n\nIn every iteration of the loop:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant n > 0;\n    loop invariant c >= 0 && c <= n;\n    loop invariant (c == n) ==> (unknown() == 0);\n    loop invariant (c != n) ==> (unknown() != 0);\n*/\n```\nExplanation: The loop body contains two nested if-else statements. If the first condition in the outer if statement is true, then the inner if statement is executed. Otherwise, the inner else statement is executed. We can split the loop invariants based on these conditions.\n\nIf `(c == n)` is true, then the else statement is executed. This means that `unknown()` must be equal to 0. Therefore, `(c == n) ==> (unknown() == 0)` holds true.\n\nIf `(c != n)` is true, then the if statement is executed. This means that `unknown()` must be non-zero. Therefore, `(c != n) ==> (unknown() != 0)` holds true.\n\nAfter the loop termination:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant n > 0;\n    loop invariant c >= 0 && c <= n;\n    loop invariant (c == n) ==> (unknown() == 0);\n    loop invariant (c != n) ==> (unknown() != 0);\n    loop invariant (n <= -1) ==> (c != n);\n*/\n```\nExplanation: The post-condition asserts that if `n` is less than or equal to -1, then `c` must be different from `n`. We can write this as an implication and add it as a loop invariant.\n\nNote that we don't need to worry about non-deterministic values of `n` since it is assumed to be greater than 0 at the beginning and we don't modify it inside the loop. We also don't need to worry about non-deterministic values of `c` at the end of the loop since the program terminates immediately after the loop.",

This is because if `c` is less than `n`, then there must be an iteration where `unknown()` returns `0` and `c` is reset to `1`. But this would violate the invariant that `unknown()` returns `1` for all iterations from `0` to `c-1`. Therefore, `c` must be equal to `n`. \n\nFinally, we need to ensure that these loop invariants imply the post-condition, which is `if (n <= -1) { assert(c != n); }`. Since the loop invariants ensure that `0 <= c <= n`, if `n` is less than or equal to `-1`, then `c` cannot be equal to `n`. Therefore, the post-condition is implied by the loop invariants."
