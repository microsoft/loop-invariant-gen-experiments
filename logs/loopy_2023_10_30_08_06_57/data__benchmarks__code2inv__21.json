However, we can assume that it is positive, because it is compared with 1 later in the program. So, we add the following loop invariant to bound `n` from below: \n```\n/*@ loop invariant n >= 1; */\n```\n- `x` starts from 1 and increases by 1 in each iteration of the loop. Therefore, we can assume that `x` is always less than or equal to `n`. We add the following loop invariant to bound `x` from above:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant x <= n; */\n```\n- Since `m` is initialized to 1 and may be updated only if the `unknown` function returns true, we can assume that `m` is always less than or equal to `x`. We add the following loop invariant to bound `m` from above:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant m <= x; */\n```\n- The assertion `m < n` is guarded by the condition `n > 1`. Therefore, we add the following loop invariant to make the assertion true when the loop terminates:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant n <= 1 ==> m < n; */\n```\n- The loop invariant `m < n` is implied by the conjunction of the above loop invariants.
