Since `n` is uninitialized, we cannot make any assumptions about its value.\n- In every iteration of the loop, either `m` stays the same or it becomes equal to `x`. Therefore, `x > m` is always true.\n- In every iteration of the loop, `x` is incremented by 1, so it will eventually become equal to `n` or greater than `n`. Therefore, `x <= n` is always true.\n- After the loop termination, `x` is either equal to `n` or greater than `n`. Therefore, `x >= n` is always true.\n- The post-condition is `m < n` if `n > 1`.
