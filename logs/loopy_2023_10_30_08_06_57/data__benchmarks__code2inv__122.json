Therefore, from the invariant `i <= size + 1`, we get `i == size + 1`. Also, from the invariant `sn <= i - 1`, we get `sn <= size`. Therefore, `sn != size` implies `sn < size`. Since `sn` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, we get `sn == i - 1`. Therefore, `sn < size` implies `i <= size`. This contradicts the fact that `i == size + 1`, which means that `sn == size` must hold. Therefore, `sn != size` implies `sn == 0`. If `sn == size`, then the loop must have executed `size` times, which means that `i == size + 1` and `sn == size` hold. Therefore, the post-condition `sn == 0` does not hold.",

This is true before the loop execution starts, and it remains true in every iteration because the value of `i` is incremented by `1` in each iteration.\n- The second loop invariant specifies that `sn` is always greater than or equal to `0`, and less than or equal to `i-1`. This is true before the loop execution starts, and it remains true in every iteration because the value of `sn` is incremented by `1` in each iteration. Note that the upper bound is `i-1` instead of `i`, because the increment of `sn` happens after the increment of `i`.\n- After the loop terminates, we know that `i > size`, because the loop condition `i <= size` is false. Therefore, we can use this fact to simplify the post-condition. We can rewrite the post-condition `sn != size ==> sn == 0` as `sn != size || sn == 0`. This means that if `sn` is not equal to `size`, then `sn` must be equal to `0`. This is true because the loop invariant `0 <= sn <= i-1` implies that `sn <= size`, and therefore `sn` cannot be greater than `size`. Using this fact, we can derive the following implication:\n  ```\n  sn != size ==> sn <= size\n  ```\n  This is true because if `sn` is not equal to `size`, then it must be less than `size` (by the loop invariant), and therefore `sn <= size`.\n  \n  Now, we can use this implication and the loop invariant `0 <= sn <= i-1` to derive the post-condition:\n  ```\n  0 <= sn <= i-1 ==> sn <= size\n  ```\n  This is true because if `0 <= sn <= i-1` is true, then we know that `sn` is less than or equal to `i-1`, which is less than or equal to `size`. Therefore, `sn` must be less than or equal to `size`. Combining this with the previous implication, we get:\n  ```\n  sn != size || sn == 0 ==> sn <= size\n  ```\n  This implies the original post-condition. Therefore, the loop invariants are:\n  ```\n  /*@\n    loop invariant 1 <= i <= size+1;\n    loop invariant 0 <= sn <= i-1;\n  */\n  ```",

It implies that `i` is always positive.\n- `sn >= 0`: This invariant holds before the loop, as `sn` is initialized to 0. It also holds in every iteration of the loop because `sn` is incremented by 1 in each iteration. It implies that `sn` is always non-negative.\n- `sn <= i - 1`: This invariant holds in every iteration of the loop because `sn` is incremented by 1 in each iteration and `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration. It implies that `sn` is always less than or equal to `i - 1`.\n- `i <= size + 1`: This invariant holds before the loop because `i` is initialized to 1 and `size` is assumed to be non-negative. It also holds in every iteration of the loop because `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration and the loop condition is `i <= size`. It implies that `i` is always less than or equal to `size + 1`.\n\nFinally, we can use the loop invariants to verify the post-condition:\n- `sn != size ==> sn == 0`\n\nExplanation:\n- If `sn != size`, then the loop must have terminated early, which means that `i <= size` is no longer true. Therefore, from the invariant `i <= size + 1`, we get `i == size + 1`. Also, from the invariant `sn <= i - 1`, we get `sn <= size`. Therefore, `sn != size` implies `sn < size`. Since `sn` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, we get `sn == i - 1`. Therefore, `sn < size` implies `i <= size`. This contradicts the fact that `i == size + 1`, which means that `sn == size` must hold. Therefore, `sn != size` implies `sn == 0`. If `sn == size`, then the loop must have executed `size` times, which means that `i == size + 1` and `sn == size` hold. Therefore, the post-condition `sn == 0` does not hold.",
