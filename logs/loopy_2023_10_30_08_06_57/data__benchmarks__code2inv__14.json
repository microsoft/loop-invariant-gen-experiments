The loop body contains the following statement:\n\n```\n{\n    (x  = (x + 2));\n    (y  = (y + 2));\n}\n```\n\nThis statement updates the values of `x` and `y` by adding 2 to them in each iteration.

This is because `x` is initialized with a non-negative value and is incremented by 2 in each iteration, and the loop condition ensures that the loop terminates at some point.\n- The second loop invariant `y >= 0 && y <= 2` ensures that `y` remains non-negative and does not exceed 2 during the loop execution. This is because `y` is initialized with a non-negative value and is incremented by 2 in each iteration, and the loop condition ensures that the loop terminates at some point.\n- The third loop invariant `(y == 0) ==> (x != 4)` ensures that if `y` becomes zero at some point during the loop execution, then `x` cannot be equal to 4 at that point. This is because the post-condition asserts that `x` is not equal to 4 if `y` is zero, and the loop body increments both `x` and `y` by the same amount in each iteration. Therefore, if `y` becomes zero at some point, then `x` must have been incremented by an even number of times, and hence cannot be equal to 4. Note that this invariant is only applicable when `y` becomes zero during the loop execution, and is vacuously true otherwise.",

The fourth invariant is derived from the fact that if x is 4, the loop has terminated and the assertion is checked. The fifth invariant is derived from the fact that if y is not zero, then the loop must still be executing, so x must be at least 2. The sixth invariant is derived from the fact that if x is less than 2, the loop must still be executing, so y cannot be greater than 2. Finally, the seventh invariant is derived from the post-condition and the loop condition. If y is not zero, the assertion is not checked, so the invariant is trivially true.
