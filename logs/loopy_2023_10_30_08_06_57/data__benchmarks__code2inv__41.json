            "Let's start with the pre-conditions and variable assignments:\n\n```\nint c;\nint n;\n(c = 0);\nassume((n > 0));\n```\n\nWe have two integer variables, `c` and `n`, and `c` is initialized to 0. The `assume` statement tells us that `n` is greater than 0.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body and condition:\n\n```\nwhile (unknown()) {\n    {\n      if ( unknown() ) {\n        if ( (c > n) )\n        {\n        (c  = (c + 1));\n        }\n      } else {\n        if ( (c == n) )\n        {\n        (c  = 1);\n        }\n      }\n\n    }\n\n  }\n```\n\nThe loop condition is `unknown()`, which means that we do not know how many times the loop will execute. Inside the loop, we have two conditional statements. \n\nLet's simplify the code using implication and add some loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant 1 <= c <= n+1;\n    loop invariant c <= n ==> \\forall integer i; 1 <= i <= n ==> i <= c;\n    loop invariant c > n ==> \\forall integer i; 1 <= i <= n ==> i < c;\n*/\nwhile (unknown()) {\n    {\n        (c > n) ==> (c = c + 1);\n        (c <= n) ==> (c = (c == n) ? 1 : c);\n    }\n}\n/*@\n    assert (c == n) || (c <= n);\n*/\n```\n\nLet's go through each of the loop invariants:\n\n- `1 <= c <= n+1;`: This invariant tells us that `c` is always between 1 and `n+1`, inclusive. The `1 <= c` part ensures that `c` is always positive, and the `c <= n+1` part ensures that `c` is never greater than `n+1`. \n\n- `c <= n ==> \\forall integer i; 1 <= i <= n ==> i <= c;`: This invariant tells us that if `c` is less than or equal to `n`, then all integers between 1 and `n` inclusive are less than or equal to `c`. This holds true because we only increment `c` if `c` is greater than `n`, so if `c` is less than or equal to `n`, it must have been assigned a value between 1 and `n`, inclusive, in a previous iteration of the loop.\n\n- `c > n ==> \\forall integer i; 1 <= i <= n ==> i < c;`: This invariant tells us that if `c` is greater than `n`, then all integers between 1 and `n` inclusive are strictly less than `c`. This holds true because `c` is incremented by 1 every time it is greater than `n`. So, if `c` is greater than `n`, it must have been incremented at least once before, which means that it was assigned a value greater than `n`. Therefore, all integers between 1 and `n` must be strictly less than `c`.\n\nFinally, the post-condition is `(c == n) || (c <= n)`. This means that `c` is either equal to `n` or less than or equal to `n`. We use implication to handle the condition in the assertion.",
