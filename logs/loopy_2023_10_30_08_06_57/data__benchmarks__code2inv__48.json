If not, the program returns 0.\n- The external function `unknown()` returns an unknown integer value.\n\nVariable assignments:\n- `c` is initialized to 0.\n\nLoop condition:\n- The loop executes as long as `unknown()` returns a non-zero value.\n\nLoop invariants:\n- Before the loop execution: `n > 0`\n- In each iteration of the loop:\n    - `c <= n`\n    - `c > 0`\n    - `c == 1 ==> unknown()`\n    - `c != 1 ==> !unknown()`\n- After the loop termination: `c == n ==> n > -1`\n\nExplanation:\n- Before the loop execution, `n` is assumed to be greater than 0.\n- In each iteration of the loop, `c` is always less than or equal to `n` (since `c` is incremented by 1 in the loop body if `c` is not equal to `n`), and `c` is always greater than 0 (since `c` is initialized to 0 and incremented by 1 in the loop body). \n- If `c` is equal to 1, then `unknown()` must return a non-zero value (since `c` is incremented to 1 only if `unknown()` returns a non-zero value). On the other hand, if `c` is not equal to 1, then `unknown()` must return 0 (since `unknown()` returns 0 if `c` is equal to `n` and `c` is not incremented in that case).\n- After the loop termination, if `c` is equal to `n`, then `n` must be greater than or equal to -1 (since the assertion `//@ assert( (n > -1) );` is guarded by the condition `c == n`).",
