                "Pre-conditions:\n- The program does not take any input.\n- The variable `x` is initialized to 0.\n- The variables `y` and `z` are uninitialized and may contain garbage values.\n\nLoop condition:\n- The loop continues as long as `x` is less than 500.\n\nLoop invariants:\n- Before the loop execution, `y` is greater than or equal to `z`.\n- In every iteration of the loop, `y` remains greater than or equal to `z`.\n- After the loop termination, `z` is greater than or equal to `y`, which implies that `z >= y`.\n\nExplanation:\n- Before the loop starts, `y` and `z` are uninitialized and can contain garbage values. Therefore, we cannot make any assumptions about their values. However, we can assume that `y` is greater than or equal to `z` because we have not yet encountered any code that assigns a value to `y` or `z`.\n- In every iteration of the loop, `x` is incremented by 1, so it becomes greater than or equal to its initial value of 0. Therefore, `x` is always greater than or equal to 0 in every iteration of the loop. \n- Inside the loop, there is an if statement that checks whether `z` is less than or equal to `y`. If this condition is true, then `y` is assigned the value of `z`. Therefore, if the condition is true, then `y` becomes equal to or less than `z`. However, if the condition is false, then `y` remains greater than or equal to `z`. Therefore, we can combine these two cases using implication: `y >= z ==> y' >= z'` where `y'` and `z'` represent the values of `y` and `z` after the loop iteration.\n- After the loop terminates, `x` is greater than or equal to 500. Since `x` is incremented by 1 in every iteration of the loop, this means that the loop executes at most 500 times. Therefore, when the loop terminates, `y` is greater than or equal to `z` and `x` is greater than or equal to 500. Since the assertion `z >= y` is guarded by the condition `x >= 500`, we can use implication: `x >= 500 ==> z >= y`.\n\nPutting it all together, the loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant y >= z;\n    loop invariant \\forall integer i; 0 <= i < x ==> y >= z;\n    loop invariant x >= 500 ==> z >= y;\n*/\n```",

If the condition is true, `y` is assigned the value of `z`.\n- Outside the loop, the program has an assertion that `z` is greater than or equal to `y`.\n\nNow let's find the necessary loop invariants for the while loop:\n- Before the loop execution:\n    - `x >= 0`\n    - `y <= z`\n    - `z` can be any integer value\n- In every iteration of the loop:\n    - `x > 0`\n    - `y <= z`\n    - If the condition `z <= y` is true, then `y = z`\n- After the loop termination, we need to prove that `z >= y` which implies:\n    - `x >= 500 ==> z >= y`\n\nPutting it all together, the loop invariants for the while loop are:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant x >= 0 && y <= z;\n    loop invariant x > 0 && y <= z;\n    loop invariant x < 500 ==> (z <= y ==> y == \\old(y));\n    loop invariant x >= 500 ==> z >= y;\n*/\n```\n\nNote that for the third invariant, we used implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code.

The third loop invariant states that if x is equal to its value at the loop entry (i.e., if the loop never executed), then y is not 0. This is because the assertion is guarded by a condition that requires x to be equal to 20, so if x is not equal to 20, the assertion is trivially true.",

Since we do not know when the loop will terminate, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where the loop executes 11 times (because `x` is bounded above by 10 and each iteration increases `x` by 10, so `x` can be at most 110).\n\nSimilarly, the second loop invariant states that `y` is always non-negative and less than or equal to 110.

So, we need to use this condition in an implication to derive the loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant (y != 0) ==> (x != 20);\n*/\n```\nThis loop invariant states that if `y` is not equal to 0, then `x` is not equal to 20. This is derived from the assertion that if `y` is equal to 0, then `x` cannot be equal to 20.\n\nFinally, we need to consider the fact that `unknown()` is non-deterministic, which means we do not know the values of `x` and `y` at the end of the loop. Therefore, we need to use an implication to make the loop invariant trivially true at the end of the loop:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant (unknown() == 0) ==> (x >= 0) && (x <= 110) && (y >= 0) && (y <= 110);\n*/\n```\nThis loop invariant states that if `unknown()` is equal to 0 (i.e., the loop terminates), then `x` and `y` are still within their bounds. This implication makes the loop invariant trivially true at the end of the loop when `unknown()` is equal to 0.\n\nPutting it all together, we have the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant (x >= 0) && (x <= 110);\n    loop invariant (y >= 0) && (y <= 110);\n    loop invariant (y != 0) ==> (x != 20);\n    loop invariant (unknown() == 0) ==> (x >= 0) && (x <= 110) && (y >= 0) && (y <= 110);\n*/\n```\nThese loop invariants are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination, and they imply the post-condition.",

Therefore, we do not have any loop invariants before the loop execution.\n- In every iteration of the loop, the values of x and y are incremented by 10.

Therefore, we can assume that the loop did not execute and that the loop invariants are still true. We can use this assumption to make the post-condition a loop invariant. So, we can add the following loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant y != 0 ==> (x != 20);\n*/\n``` \n\nNote that we used the implication operator (==>) to take into account the conditional nature of the post-condition. We also used the modulo operator (%) to express that x and y are incremented by 10 in every iteration.

The assignments do not change any of the loop conditions, so we do not need to consider them in our loop invariants.\n\nLoop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant 0 <= x <= 20;\n  loop invariant 0 <= y <= 10;\n*/\n```\nExplanation: Since x is incremented by 10 in every iteration, it can take values from 0 to 20. Similarly, y is incremented by 10 in every iteration and can take values from 0 to 10. These invariants hold true before the loop execution, in every iteration, and after the loop termination.\n\nNext, we need to check if these loop invariants imply the post-condition. We need to consider the case when x == 20. If x == 20, then we know that x must have been incremented exactly twice in the loop. Therefore, the loop must have executed exactly twice. If the loop executed twice, then y must have been incremented by 20. Therefore, y != 0. We can express this implication as follows:\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant 0 <= x <= 20;\n  loop invariant 0 <= y <= 10;\n  requires x == 20;\n  assigns \\nothing;\n  ensures y != 0 ==> x == 20;\n*/\n```\nExplanation: We add a requires clause to capture the case when x == 20. We add an assigns clause to state that the loop body does not modify any variables. We add an ensures clause to express the implication between the loop invariants and the post-condition.\n\nFinally, we need to handle the non-deterministic behavior of the unknown function. We can add an additional loop invariant to handle this:\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant 0 <= x <= 20;\n  loop invariant 0 <= y <= 10;\n  loop invariant (unknown() ==> \\true);\n  requires x == 20;\n  assigns \\nothing;\n  ensures y != 0 ==> x == 20;\n*/\n```\nExplanation: We add a loop invariant that states that unknown() is true in every iteration. Since we do not know the behavior of unknown(), we can assume that it is true in order to make the invariant hold. This invariant is vacuously true if unknown() is always false. We keep the previous loop invariants and post-condition unchanged. \n\nTherefore, the final set of loop invariants is:\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant 0 <= x <= 20;\n  loop invariant 0 <= y <= 10;\n  loop invariant (unknown() ==> \\true);\n  requires x == 20;\n  assigns \\nothing;\n  ensures y != 0 ==> x == 20;\n*/\n```",

Since x starts at a value between 0 and 10, it can be incremented by 10 at most once. So, z1 <= 1. Similarly, y starts at a value between 0 and 10, and it can be incremented by 10 at most once. So, z2 <= 1. z3 can be any non-negative number, so z3 >= 0.\n- The sum of z1, z2, and z3 must be equal to the number of times the loop executes. Since the loop executes an unknown number of times, we cannot bound the value of this sum.\n- Since x is incremented by 10 every time (x = x + 10) executes, x must be equal to 10 times the number of times (x = x + 10) executes. So, x == 10 * z1.\n- Similarly, y must be equal to 10 times the number of times (y = y + 10) executes.

The loop body contains the following statement:\n\n```\n{\n    (x  = (x + 2));\n    (y  = (y + 2));\n}\n```\n\nThis statement updates the values of `x` and `y` by adding 2 to them in each iteration.

This is because `x` is initialized with a non-negative value and is incremented by 2 in each iteration, and the loop condition ensures that the loop terminates at some point.\n- The second loop invariant `y >= 0 && y <= 2` ensures that `y` remains non-negative and does not exceed 2 during the loop execution. This is because `y` is initialized with a non-negative value and is incremented by 2 in each iteration, and the loop condition ensures that the loop terminates at some point.\n- The third loop invariant `(y == 0) ==> (x != 4)` ensures that if `y` becomes zero at some point during the loop execution, then `x` cannot be equal to 4 at that point. This is because the post-condition asserts that `x` is not equal to 4 if `y` is zero, and the loop body increments both `x` and `y` by the same amount in each iteration. Therefore, if `y` becomes zero at some point, then `x` must have been incremented by an even number of times, and hence cannot be equal to 4. Note that this invariant is only applicable when `y` becomes zero during the loop execution, and is vacuously true otherwise.",

Finally, the seventh invariant is derived from the post-condition and the loop condition. If y is not zero, the assertion is not checked, so the invariant is trivially true.

Therefore, we can use an implication to make this invariant true after the loop termination:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant m >= 0;\n    loop invariant x >= n ==> m < n;\n    loop invariant x <= n ==> x < n;\n*/\n```\n\nNote that we used implications to handle the conditional nature of the code.

The second implication handles the case where `x` is less than or equal to `n`, which implies that `x` is less than `n`. We also used the relation between `x` and `m` to write the loop invariant for `m` in every iteration of the loop.

Since `m` is initialized to 0, we have `0 <= m`. Since `n` contains garbage value, we can only assume `n >= 0`. Thus, the following loop invariants hold before the loop:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= x;\n    loop invariant 0 <= m;\n    loop invariant n >= 0;\n*/\n```\n- In every iteration: The loop body has two cases. In the first case, if `unknown()` returns true, then `m` is assigned the value of `x`. This means that `m` is at least as large as `x` at the end of the iteration. In the second case, `m` remains unchanged, so it is still at least as large as its previous value. Since `x` is incremented by 1, we have `x >= \\old(x) + 1`. Since `m` is non-negative, we have `m >= \\old(m)`. Thus, the following loop invariants hold in every iteration:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant m >= \\old(m);\n    loop invariant x >= \\old(x) + 1 ==> m >= \\old(x);\n*/\n```\n- After the loop: The loop terminates when `x` is greater than or equal to `n`.

                "We are given a C program with a while loop and an assertion. We need to find the necessary loop invariants for Frama-C to verify the post-condition. Let's analyze the program step by step:\n\n**Pre-conditions:**\n- None\n\n**Variable Assignments:**\n- `int x = 0;` Initializes variable `x` to 0.\n- `int m = 0;` Initializes variable `m` to 0.\n- `int n;` Declares variable `n`.\n\n**Loop Condition:**\n- `while (x < n)` The loop will execute as long as `x` is less than `n`.\n\n**Loop Body:**\n- `if (unknown()) { m = x; }` If `unknown()` returns a non-zero value, assign `x` to `m`.\n- `x = x + 1;` Increment the value of `x` by 1.\n\n**Post-condition:**\n- `if(n > 0) { //@ assert(m >= 0); }` If `n` is greater than 0, assert that `m` is greater than or equal to 0.\n\n**Loop Invariants:**\n- `x >= 0` - `x` is always greater than or equal to 0.\n- `n >= 0` - `n` is always greater than or equal to 0.\n- `m >= 0` - `m` is always greater than or equal to 0. (This is the assertion we need to verify.)\n\n**Loop Invariants Explanation:**\n- `x >= 0` is always true at the beginning of the loop because `x` is initialized to 0 and is only incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.\n- `n >= 0` is always true because `n` is not assigned any value and is uninitialized, so it can be assumed to be greater than or equal to 0.\n- `m >= 0` is the assertion that we need to verify. Since `m` is assigned the value of `x` only when `unknown()` returns a non-zero value, we need to show that `m` is always greater than or equal to 0. We can prove this by using implication. We know that `m` is initialized to 0 and is only assigned values of `x` that are greater than or equal to 0 (since `x` is always greater than or equal to 0). Therefore, we can say that `m >= 0` is true at the end of the loop if `x >= 0`. Thus, the loop invariant for `m >= 0` is true before the loop, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. \n\n**Final Loop Invariants:**\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant n >= 0;\n    loop invariant m >= 0 ==> x >= 0;\n*/\n```",

We add the following loop invariant to bound `m` from above:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant m <= x; */\n```\n- The assertion `m < n` is guarded by the condition `n > 1`.

                "We first note the pre-conditions and variable assignments in the program:\n- The program assumes the existence of a function `unknown()` that returns a non-deterministic value.\n- The program defines integer variables `z1`, `z2`, `z3`, `x`, `m`, and `n`.\n- The variable `x` is initialized to 1.\n- The variable `m` is initialized to 1.\n- There is no explicit initialization of the variable `n`, so it may contain garbage values.\n\nNext, we analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition:\n- The loop condition is `x < n`.\n\nTo find necessary loop invariants, we need to analyze the program and its assertions to determine what conditions must be true at certain points in the program. Here are some possible loop invariants for the while loop:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 1 <= x <= n;\n    loop invariant 1 <= m <= x;\n*/\n```\nExplanation:\n- Loop invariant 1: Since `x` starts at 1 and is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, it is always greater than or equal to 1. Since `n` may contain garbage values, we cannot determine an upper bound for `x`. However, we know that the loop terminates when `x` becomes greater than or equal to `n`. Therefore, `x` is always less than or equal to `n`.\n- Loop invariant 2: `m` is initialized to 1 and may be updated to `x` if the condition `unknown()` is true. Since `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, we know that `m` is always less than or equal to `x`.\n\nFinally, we need to verify that the loop invariants imply the post-condition. The post-condition is an assertion that `m` is greater than or equal to 1 if `n` is greater than 1. We can use implication to handle the conditional nature of the code:\n```\n{;\n    //@ assert n <= 1 || m >= 1;\n}\n```\nExplanation:\n- If `n` is less than or equal to 1, then the assertion is trivially true, since the loop is never executed and `m` is equal to 1.\n- If `n` is greater than 1, then we know from loop invariant 2 that `m` is greater than or equal to 1.\n\nTherefore, the final program with loop invariants and the post-condition assertion is:\n```\n#define assume(e) if(!(e)) return 0;\nextern int unknown(void);\n\nint main()\n{\n    int z1,z2,z3;\n    int x = 1;\n    int m = 1;\n    int n;\n\n    //@ loop invariant 1 <= x <= n;\n    //@ loop invariant 1 <= m <= x;\n    while (x < n) {\n        if (unknown()) {\n            m = x;\n        }\n        x = x + 1;\n    }\n\n    {;\n        //@ assert n <= 1 || m >= 1;\n    }\n}\n```",

If `j` is less than `i`, then the loop has not executed, and hence `j` is still equal to 10. Therefore, the implication ensures that the loop invariant is true in all cases. \n\nWe also added loop invariants to bound the range of `i` and `j`. Since `i` is incremented by 2 in each iteration and starts at 1, its maximum value is 11. Similarly, `j` is decremented by 1 in each iteration and starts at 10, so its minimum value is 6. \n\nFinally, we added a loop invariant that ensures that the difference between `j` and `i` is always a multiple of 3.

This is because in each iteration of the loop, i is increased by 2 and j is decreased by 1. Therefore, the difference between j and i will always be an odd number. However, since j is greater than or equal to i and the difference is odd, it follows that the difference must be an odd multiple of 2, i.e., even. Therefore, the loop invariant (j - i) % 2 == 0 holds true in every iteration of the loop.\n- The third loop invariant ensures that j is equal to 6 after the loop terminates. We use the implication j == i - 2 ==> j == 6, which means that if j is ever equal to i - 2 during the loop execution, then j must be equal to 6. This implication holds true because in each iteration of the loop, i is increased by 2 and j is decreased by 1. Therefore, j will be equal to i - 2 at some point during the loop execution.

This is because the loop can terminate at any point, and we need to ensure that the value of `c` is valid even if the loop terminates early.\n\nFinal loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= c <= n;\n    loop invariant (unknown() && c <= n) ==> (c <= n+1);\n    loop invariant (!unknown() && c == n) ==> (c == 1);\n    loop invariant 0 <= c <= n;\n*/\n```"

This holds true because we only increment `c` if `c` is greater than `n`, so if `c` is less than or equal to `n`, it must have been assigned a value between 1 and `n`, inclusive, in a previous iteration of the loop.\n\n- `c > n ==> \\forall integer i; 1 <= i <= n ==> i < c;`: This invariant tells us that if `c` is greater than `n`, then all integers between 1 and `n` inclusive are strictly less than `c`. This holds true because `c` is incremented by 1 every time it is greater than `n`. So, if `c` is greater than `n`, it must have been incremented at least once before, which means that it was assigned a value greater than `n`. Therefore, all integers between 1 and `n` must be strictly less than `c`.\n\nFinally, the post-condition is `(c == n) || (c <= n)`.

For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values. Do not use variables that have garbage values.**\n- **Do not use keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops.**\n- **Variables that are not explicitly initialized, could have garbage values. Do not make any assumptions about such values.**\n- **Do not use the \\at(x, Pre) notation for any variable x.**\n- **Do not use non-deterministic function calls.**"

Otherwise, `c` remains the same. In either case, `c` remains greater than or equal to 0.\n- After the loop, `c` can be either equal to `n` or equal to 1.

This is because the code within the loop sets `c` to 1 only if `c` equals `n`. \n\nPost-condition:\n- If `c` is less than 0 or greater than `n`, then `c` must equal `n`.\n\nNote:\n- There are no non-deterministic variables at the beginning or end of the loop in this program."

                "**Step 1: Pre-conditions and variable assignments**\n\nThe program initializes two integer variables `c` and `n`. The value of `c` is set to 0 and the value of `n` is unknown. The program then assumes that `n` is greater than 0.\n\n**Step 2: Loop condition**\n\nThe loop condition is `unknown()`. Since `unknown()` returns a non-deterministic value, we cannot reason about the exact number of loop iterations.\n\n**Step 3: Loop invariants**\n\nLet's try to find loop invariants that hold true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nBefore the loop execution:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant n > 0;\n    loop invariant c >= 0 && c <= n;\n*/\n```\nExplanation: Since `n` is assumed to be greater than 0, it holds true before the loop execution. The value of `c` is initialized to 0, so it is greater than or equal to 0. Since `c` is updated inside the loop, we need to ensure that `c` is always less than or equal to `n`.\n\nIn every iteration of the loop:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant n > 0;\n    loop invariant c >= 0 && c <= n;\n    loop invariant (c == n) ==> (unknown() == 0);\n    loop invariant (c != n) ==> (unknown() != 0);\n*/\n```\nExplanation: The loop body contains two nested if-else statements. If the first condition in the outer if statement is true, then the inner if statement is executed. Otherwise, the inner else statement is executed. We can split the loop invariants based on these conditions.\n\nIf `(c == n)` is true, then the else statement is executed. This means that `unknown()` must be equal to 0. Therefore, `(c == n) ==> (unknown() == 0)` holds true.\n\nIf `(c != n)` is true, then the if statement is executed. This means that `unknown()` must be non-zero. Therefore, `(c != n) ==> (unknown() != 0)` holds true.\n\nAfter the loop termination:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant n > 0;\n    loop invariant c >= 0 && c <= n;\n    loop invariant (c == n) ==> (unknown() == 0);\n    loop invariant (c != n) ==> (unknown() != 0);\n    loop invariant (n <= -1) ==> (c != n);\n*/\n```\nExplanation: The post-condition asserts that if `n` is less than or equal to -1, then `c` must be different from `n`. We can write this as an implication and add it as a loop invariant.\n\nNote that we don't need to worry about non-deterministic values of `n` since it is assumed to be greater than 0 at the beginning and we don't modify it inside the loop. We also don't need to worry about non-deterministic values of `c` at the end of the loop since the program terminates immediately after the loop.",

This is because if `c` is less than `n`, then there must be an iteration where `unknown()` returns `0` and `c` is reset to `1`. But this would violate the invariant that `unknown()` returns `1` for all iterations from `0` to `c-1`. Therefore, `c` must be equal to `n`. \n\nFinally, we need to ensure that these loop invariants imply the post-condition, which is `if (n <= -1) { assert(c != n); }`. Since the loop invariants ensure that `0 <= c <= n`, if `n` is less than or equal to `-1`, then `c` cannot be equal to `n`. Therefore, the post-condition is implied by the loop invariants."

Therefore, `c` has to be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 4 in every iteration of the loop.\n- `c != 0`: The variable `c` cannot be equal to 0 in any iteration of the loop because it is initialized to 0 before the loop and is modified within the loop.\n\nAfter the loop termination:\n- `c >= 1`: If the loop terminates, then the loop condition (unknown) must be false. Therefore, the last if statement in the loop sets the value of `c` to 1. Hence, `c` has to be greater than or equal to 1 after the loop termination.\n- `c <= 4`: If the loop terminates, then the loop condition (unknown) must be false. Therefore, the last if statement in the loop sets the value of `c` to 1. Hence, `c` has to be less than or equal to 4 after the loop termination.\n- `(c <= 4) ==> (c <= 4)`: This is a trivial invariant that is always true. It is added here to take care of the conditional nature of the assertion in the post-condition. \n\nPutting all the loop invariants together, we get:\n\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant c >= 0;\n  loop invariant (c >= 1) && (c <= 4);\n  loop invariant c != 0;\n  loop invariant c >= 1;\n  loop invariant c <= 4;\n  loop invariant (c <= 4) ==> (c <= 4);\n*/\n```",

The input to Frama-C is a C program file with ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations.\nFor the given program, find the necessary loop invariants of the while loop to help Frama-C verify the post-condition.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. \n- Output loop invariants that are true \n(i) before the loop execution, \n(ii) in every iteration of the loop and \n(iii) after the loop termination, \nsuch that the loop invariants imply the post condition.\n- If a loop invariant is a conjunction, split it into its parts.\n- Output all the loop invariants in one code block. For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values. Do not use variables that have garbage values.**\n- **Do not use keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops.**\n- **Variables that are not explicitly initialized, could have garbage values. Do not make any assumptions about such values.**\n- **Do not use the \\at(x, Pre) notation for any variable x.**\n- **Do not use non-deterministic function calls.**"

                "**Step 1: Pre-conditions and variable assignments**\n\nThe program declares and initializes five integer variables: c, n, v1, v2, and v3. It then assigns 0 to c and assumes that n is greater than 0. \n\n**Step 2: Loop condition**\n\nThe loop condition is `while(unknown())`. Since the `unknown()` function has no defined behavior, we cannot make any assumptions about the loop condition. \n\n**Step 3: Loop invariants**\n\nLet's start with the post-condition: `assert( (c >= 0) );`. We will need to find loop invariants that imply this post-condition. \n\nBefore the loop, we can add the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= c <= n;\n    loop invariant 0 <= v1 <= INT_MAX;\n    loop invariant 0 <= v2 <= INT_MAX;\n    loop invariant 0 <= v3 <= INT_MAX;\n*/\n```\nThe first loop invariant ensures that c is always between 0 and n, which is a necessary condition for the post-condition to hold. \n\nFor the loop body, we can use the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= c <= n;\n    loop invariant 0 <= v1 <= INT_MAX;\n    loop invariant 0 <= v2 <= INT_MAX;\n    loop invariant 0 <= v3 <= INT_MAX;\n    loop invariant (c == n) ==> (1 <= v1 <= INT_MAX);\n    loop invariant (c == n) ==> (1 <= v2 <= INT_MAX);\n    loop invariant (c == n) ==> (1 <= v3 <= INT_MAX);\n    loop invariant (c != n) ==> (0 <= v1 <= INT_MAX);\n    loop invariant (c != n) ==> (0 <= v2 <= INT_MAX);\n    loop invariant (c != n) ==> (0 <= v3 <= INT_MAX);\n*/\n```\nThe first four invariants are the same as the ones before the loop. The next three invariants use implication to specify the relationship between c and the v variables when the condition `(c == n)` holds. Similarly, the last three invariants specify the relationship between c and the v variables when the condition `(c != n)` holds. \n\nAfter the loop, we can add the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= c <= n;\n    loop invariant 0 <= v1 <= INT_MAX;\n    loop invariant 0 <= v2 <= INT_MAX;\n    loop invariant 0 <= v3 <= INT_MAX;\n    loop invariant (c == n) ==> (1 <= v1 <= INT_MAX);\n    loop invariant (c == n) ==> (1 <= v2 <= INT_MAX);\n    loop invariant (c == n) ==> (1 <= v3 <= INT_MAX);\n    loop invariant (c != n) ==> (0 <= v1 <= INT_MAX);\n    loop invariant (c != n) ==> (0 <= v2 <= INT_MAX);\n    loop invariant (c != n) ==> (0 <= v3 <= INT_MAX);\n    loop invariant (c != n) ==> (c >= 0);\n*/\n```\nThe first six invariants are the same as the ones for the loop body. The last invariant uses implication to ensure that if `(c != n)` holds, then `c` is non-negative, which is a necessary condition for the post-condition to hold. \n\nPutting it all together, we get the following code block for all the loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= c <= n;\n    loop invariant 0 <= v1 <= INT_MAX;\n    loop invariant 0 <= v2 <= INT_MAX;\n    loop invariant 0 <= v3 <= INT_MAX;\n    loop invariant (c == n) ==> (1 <= v1 <= INT_MAX);\n    loop invariant (c == n) ==> (1 <= v2 <= INT_MAX);\n    loop invariant (c == n) ==> (1 <= v3 <= INT_MAX);\n    loop invariant (c != n) ==> (0 <= v1 <= INT_MAX);\n    loop invariant (c != n) ==> (0 <= v2 <= INT_MAX);\n    loop invariant (c != n) ==> (0 <= v3 <= INT_MAX);\n    loop invariant (c != n) ==> (c >= 0);\n*/\n``` \n\nNote that we did not use any non-deterministic function calls or variables with garbage values in our loop invariants.",

Since the loop condition depends on a non-deterministic function call, we cannot make any assumptions about the exact number of iterations. However, we can say that `c` is always non-negative and less than or equal to `n`.\n- After the loop termination, if `c` is not equal to `n`, then it must be less than `n`. This is because `c` is incremented by 1 whenever the condition `unknown()` is true and `c` is not equal to `n`. Therefore, the loop terminates when `c` becomes equal to `n`. Since the loop invariant guarantees that `c` is non-negative and less than or equal to `n`, if `c` is not equal to `n`, then it must be non-negative.",

The loop condition is `unknown()`. Since `unknown()` is a non-deterministic function, we cannot reason about the exact number of loop iterations or the value of `c` after the loop terminates. Therefore, we must come up with loop invariants that are true before the loop, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop.\n\nHere are some loop invariants that we can use:\n```\n/*@ \nloop invariant 0 <= c <= n;\nloop invariant (c == n) ==> (n <= -1);\nloop invariant (c != n) ==> (1 <= c <= n-1);\n*/\n```\n\nLet's break down the loop invariants and explain why they hold:\n- `0 <= c <= n;` - This invariant is true before the loop, and in every iteration of the loop. This is because `c` is assigned to 0 before the loop, and is incremented or reset to 1 in every iteration of the loop. Since `n` is assumed to be greater than 0, `c` must always be between 0 and `n`.\n- `(c == n) ==> (n <= -1);` - This invariant is true after the loop. Since the loop condition is `unknown()`, we cannot reason about the exact number of loop iterations. However, if `c` is equal to `n` after the loop, then the assertion is triggered. The assertion can only be true if `n` is less than or equal to -1. Therefore, this invariant holds.\n- `(c != n) ==> (1 <= c <= n-1);` - This invariant is true before the loop, and in every iteration of the loop. This is because if `c` is not equal to `n`, then it must be between 1 and `n-1`. In every iteration of the loop, `c` is either incremented or reset to 1, so it must still be between 1 and `n-1`.",

Since we know that `x` is bounded above by `n+1`, we can add the following loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant y == (n - x) || (n < 0); */\n```\nThis invariant is trivially true if `n < 0`, which is possible since `n` is uninitialized.\n\n- After the loop termination, if `n > 0`, we know that `x` has been incremented `n` times and is equal to `n+1`. Therefore, `y` is equal to `n-x` which is `-1`. Since `y` should be non-negative, we can add the following loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant (n > 0 && y >= 0) ==> x == n+1; */\n```\n- Finally, we can use implication to guard the post-condition by the condition `n > 0`.

Therefore, we can add the loop invariant `x >= 1`.\n- Since `y` is uninitialized, we cannot add any loop invariant related to `y`.\n\n**Maintenance:**\n- In each iteration of the loop, `x` is incremented by 1 and `y` is assigned the value `n - x`.

For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values. Do not use variables that have garbage values.**\n- **Do not use keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops.**\n- **Variables that are not explicitly initialized, could have garbage values. Do not make any assumptions about such values.**\n- **Do not use the \\at(x, Pre) notation for any variable x.**\n- **Do not use non-deterministic function calls.**"

Therefore, the loop invariant `0 <= z <= 36*(y+1)` is true before, during, and after the loop execution.\n- The loop invariant `z = 36*y + c` is true in every iteration of the loop. This can be easily proven by induction. At the beginning of the loop, `c` is 0 and `z` is `36*y`. In each iteration of the loop, `z` is incremented by 1 and `c` is incremented by 1, so `z` is always equal to `36*y + c`.\n- The loop invariant `c < 36 ==> z = 36*y + c` is true in every iteration of the loop.

If `c` is equal to or greater than 36, then the loop exits and the assertion is checked. If the assertion fails, the program terminates. Otherwise, the program continues to execute after the loop. In either case, the invariant is true.\n\nPost-condition:\n- If `c` is less than 36, then `z` is greater than or equal to 0.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants imply the post-condition. \n\nOutput:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= c <= 36;\n    loop invariant 0 <= z <= 36*(y+1);\n    loop invariant z = 36*y + c;\n    loop invariant c < 36 ==> z = 36*y + c;\n*/\n```",

Also, we have added a loop assigns clause to specify that the loop modifies only the variables `z` and `c`.",
                "First, let's analyze the pre-conditions and variable assignments in the program:\n- `c` is initialized to 0.\n- `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, and `y` are uninitialized and may have garbage values.\n- `z` is assigned `36 * y`.\n- `y` is assumed to be greater than or equal to 0 and greater than or equal to 127.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body:\n- The loop executes while the non-deterministic function `unknown()` returns true.\n- If `c` is less than 36, `z` is incremented by 1 and `c` is incremented by 1.\n\nNext, let's look at the post-condition:\n- If `z` is less than 0 or greater than or equal to 4608 and the condition in the if-statement is true, then `c` must be greater than or equal to 36.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can come up with the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= c <= 36;\n    loop invariant 36 * y <= z <= 36 * y + c;\n    loop invariant y >= 127 ==> z >= 4572;\n    loop invariant z < 0 ==> (c >= 36) ==> (z < 0 || z >= 4608);\n*/\n```\nExplanation:\n- The first loop invariant ensures that `c` stays within the range [0, 36].\n- The second loop invariant ensures that `z` stays within the range [36 * y, 36 * y + c]. This is because `z` is initialized to `36 * y` and is incremented by 1 at most 36 times in each iteration of the loop. Therefore, the maximum value of `z` is `36 * y + 36 = 36 * y + c`.\n- The third loop invariant uses implication to state that if `y` is greater than or equal to 127, then `z` must be greater than or equal to 4572. This is because `z` is initialized to `36 * y` and `36 * 127 = 4572`.\n- The fourth loop invariant uses implication to state that if `z` is less than 0 and `c` is greater than or equal to 36, then the assertion must hold. This is because if `z` is less than 0, then the assertion must hold regardless of the value of `c`. If `z` is greater than or equal to 4608, then the assertion must hold regardless of the value of `c`. Therefore, the only case where the assertion may not hold is when `z` is between 0 and 4607 and `c` is less than 36. However, since the loop invariant ensures that `c` stays within the range [0, 36], this case cannot occur.",

We know that `x` and `y` are both non-negative, and `x` is greater than or equal to `y`.

However, the second loop invariant only states that `y` is greater than or equal to `0`.\n- In every iteration of the loop, `x` is updated to `x + y`, which means that `x` is increasing by at least `y` in every iteration. Therefore, `x` will eventually become non-negative and the loop will terminate. This satisfies the first loop invariant.\n- In every iteration of the loop, `y` is updated to `y + 1`, which means that `y` is increasing by `1` in every iteration. Therefore, `y` will always be non-negative, satisfying the second loop invariant.\n- After the loop termination, `x` is either `0` or positive, because the loop condition is `x < 0`.

This is because the only assignments to `lock` in the loop are `lock = 1` and `lock = 0`. Therefore, `lock` can only take the values `0` or `1`.\n- `x` is equal to `y` at the beginning of the first iteration of the loop. This is because `x` is assigned the value of `y` before the loop, and the loop condition checks for `x != y`. Therefore, the first iteration of the loop will only execute if `x == y`.\n- If `lock` is `1` at the beginning of an iteration of the loop, then `x` is equal to `y` at the end of that iteration. This is because the only assignment to `x` in the loop, when `lock == 1`, is `x = y`. Therefore, if `lock == 1` at the beginning of an iteration, then `x` will be equal to `y` at the end of that iteration.\n- If `lock` is `0` at the beginning of an iteration of the loop, then `y` is one more than its previous value at the end of that iteration. This is because the only assignment to `y` in the loop, when `lock == 0`, is `y = y + 1`. Therefore, if `lock == 0` at the beginning of an iteration, then `y` will be one more than its previous value at the end of that iteration.\n- `x` is always less than or equal to `y` throughout the loop. This is because `x` is only assigned the value of `y` or a value larger than `y` (which is `y + 1`), and `y` is only assigned a value larger than its previous value (when `lock == 0`). Therefore, `x` is always less than or equal to `y`.\n- The loop terminates. This is because the loop condition checks for `x != y`, and `x` is only assigned the value of `y` or a value larger than `y` (which is `y + 1`). Therefore, `x` can only be greater than `y` a finite number of times, and eventually `x` will be equal to `y` and the loop will terminate.\n\nPutting it all together, the loop invariants are:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant lock == 0 || lock == 1;\n    loop invariant x == y || \\old(x != y);\n    loop invariant lock == 1 ==> x == y;\n    loop invariant lock == 0 ==> y == \\old(y) + 1;\n    loop invariant x <= y;\n    loop invariant x == y || lock == 0;\n*/\n\nwhile ((x != y)) {\n    {\n      lock == 1 ==> (x = y);\n      lock == 0 ==> (y = \\old(y) + 1);\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\nNote that the loop invariants are written in the order in which they were derived.",

In every iteration of the loop, `x` is either set to `y` or `y + 1`.\n- `y` is non-decreasing, which is true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop. This is because `y` is either incremented by 1 or set to its current value.\n- `y` is either equal to `x` or `x + 1`. This is true before the loop execution since `x` is initially assigned the value of `y`. In every iteration of the loop, `y` is either set to `x` or `x + 1`.\n- If `lock` is 1, then `x` must be equal to `y`.

This is true in every iteration of the loop since `lock` is set to 0 when `x` is not equal to `y`.\n- If `x` is equal to `y`, then `lock` can be either 0 or 1. This is true in every iteration of the loop since `lock` can be set to either 0 or 1 when `x` is equal to `y`.\n- `unknown()` is always 0 between `old(y)` and `y`.

Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that y is non-negative before the loop starts. Additionally, x should be non-negative as well, to ensure that the loop condition remains true during the loop execution.\n- In every iteration of the loop: Since the loop only modifies y and x, it is sufficient to include invariants that relate to these variables only. First, we need to ensure that y remains non-negative during the loop execution. Therefore, we include the invariant y >= 0. Second, we need to ensure that y increases or remains the same in every iteration of the loop. Therefore, we include the invariant y >= \\old(y).

This satisfies the second invariant.\n- Since `y` is only incremented, it is always greater than or equal to its previous value. This satisfies the third invariant.\n- `x` is not modified inside the loop, and it is initialized to 0, which means `x` is non-negative.

The second conjunct `x >= 0 ==> y-x >= 0` is derived from the loop body `y = y + x`. If `x >= 0`, then `y` can only increase or stay the same.

Using the loop invariant `x + y == 3 * (i - 1)`, we can rewrite this as `x + y == 3 * (n - 1) + 3`. We know that `i <= n` is true for all iterations, so the final value of `i` is at most `n`.

This is true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop. After the loop termination, i = n+1, so the invariant is still true.\n- The second loop invariant ensures that j is always equal to (i * (i - 1))/2. This is true before the loop execution (since i is initially 0 and j is initially 0) and in every iteration of the loop (since j is incremented by i in each iteration). After the loop termination, i = n+1 and j = (n * (n+1))/2, so the invariant is still true.\n- The third loop invariant is the most complex one. It ensures that the assertion holds true at every point in the loop. We can see that (i-1) + ((j-((i-1)*i/2)) + k) is equal to (i-1) + (j - (i*(i-1))/2 + k), which simplifies to i*(i-1)/2 + j + k. So the loop invariant ensures that i*(i-1)/2 + j + k is always greater than 2*(i-1), which implies that (i + (j + k)) > (2 * n). This is true before the loop execution (since i is initially 0 and j is initially 0), in every iteration of the loop (since i and j are incremented by 1 and i, respectively) and after the loop termination (since i = n+1 and j = (n * (n+1))/2). \n\nNote that we didn't need to use any non-deterministic function calls or the \\at(x, Pre) notation for any variable x.

Hence, the maximum value of i at the end of the loop is n+1.\n- j <= (n + 1) * (n + 2) / 2 is an invariant because j is incremented by i in each iteration and the maximum value of i is n+1. Hence, the maximum value of j at the end of the loop can be calculated as the sum of the first (n+1) positive integers.\n- i + j > i and i + j > j are invariants because i and j are incremented in each iteration of the loop and their sum is increased by at least 1 in each iteration. Hence, their sum is always greater than either i or j.\n- i + j > 2 * (i - 1) is an invariant because i is incremented by 1 in each iteration and j is incremented by i. Hence, in the ith iteration, the value of j is at least i and the value of i is at least i-1. Therefore, their sum is at least 2*(i-1).\n- i + j > 2 * (j - i) is an invariant because i is incremented by 1 in each iteration and j is incremented by i. Hence, in the ith iteration, the value of j is at least i and the value of i is at most i-1.

If i <= n, then the sum i + j + k is at most 2n and the implication is trivially true. Otherwise, i > n and we need to show that j > (n + 1) * (n + 2) / 2 - i - k. Since j is incremented by i in each iteration, the sum of the first i positive integers is less than or equal to j. Therefore, j > (i-1)*i/2 and i + j + k > 2 * n implies that (i-1)*i/2 + i + k > 2 * n. This can be simplified to i^2 + i - 2n + 2k > 0. The discriminant of this quadratic equation is 1 + 8n - 8k, which is always non-negative because k >= 0 and n >= 0. Hence, the quadratic equation has two real roots and we can choose the positive root to obtain the inequality i > (-1 + sqrt(1 + 8n - 8k))/2. Therefore, j > (i-1)*i/2 > (n+1)*(n+2)/2 - i - k, which proves the implication.",

Therefore, the first and third loop invariants hold true. Also, since `i <= x` is the loop condition, we have `i <= x + 1`. Therefore, the second loop invariant also holds true.\n- After the loop termination, we have `i > x` and `j == y * i`. Therefore, we have `i == j / y`.

So, `j` should always be equal to `y` times the number of times the loop has executed so far.\n- `(i > x ==> y == 1 ==> i == j);` is an implication that handles the conditional assertion.

This is because the loop body sets `m` to `a` if `m` is less than `a`, and this invariant ensures that `m` never goes below this value.\n- `m <= \\max(c, a, m_old);` - This ensures that `m` is always less than or equal to the maximum of `c`, `a` and the old value of `m` and is true during and after the loop. This is because `m` can only be updated to a new value if `m` is less than `a`, and this invariant ensures that `m` never goes above this value.\n\nFinally, we can use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code.

Before the loop execution:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 1: sn == 0;\n    loop invariant 2: i >= 1;\n*/\n```\nExplanation: \n- `sn` is initialized to 0 before the loop and we know that no operation inside the loop changes its value. Hence, `sn` must be equal to 0 before the loop.\n- `i` is initialized to 1 before the loop and we know that the loop condition requires that `i` is greater than or equal to 1.

In every iteration of the loop:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 1: sn == (i - 1);\n    loop invariant 2: i <= n + 1;\n*/\n```\nExplanation:\n- After each iteration of the loop, `i` is incremented by 1 and `sn` is incremented by 1 as well. Hence, `sn` will always be equal to `i-1` inside the loop.\n- Since the loop condition requires that `i` is less than or equal to `n`, `i` can take a maximum value of `n` and then the loop will terminate.

Hence, `sn` must be less than or equal to `n`.\n- Since `sn` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop and `sn` starts from 0, `sn` must be greater than or equal to 0.\n- If `sn` is equal to `n` after the loop, it means that the loop executed `n` times and `i` was incremented `n` times, so `i` must be equal to `n+1`. Hence, `sn = n` implies `i = n+1`.\n- `i` must be greater than or equal to 1 after the loop, as `i` starts from 1 and can only be incremented inside the loop. \n\nFinal Assertion:\n- The assertion is guarded by a condition `sn != n`.

Hence, the invariant `sn <= n` holds.\n- When `sn == n`, the loop executed `n` times and `i` was incremented `n` times, so `i` must be equal to `n+1`.

Therefore, at the end of the loop, i is always less than or equal to n + 1.\n\nUsing these loop invariants, we can prove the post-condition as follows:\n- Assume sn != 0.\n- Then, sn >= 1 (from sn >= 0) and sn <= i - 1 (from sn <= i - 1).\n- Since i is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration of the loop, i is greater than or equal to 2 (from i >= 1 and i <= n + 1).\n- Therefore, sn is always less than or equal to i - 1, which is less than or equal to n (from i <= n + 1).\n- Hence, sn must be equal to n (from sn <= i - 1 and i <= n + 1).\n- Therefore, the post-condition is satisfied.\n\nPutting it all together, the loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i >= 1;\n    loop invariant sn >= 0;\n    loop invariant sn <= i - 1;\n    loop invariant i <= n + 1;\n*/\n```",

Otherwise, sn must be equal to -1 and it must have been incremented n times, where n is the number of iterations of the loop. Therefore, sn must be equal to its initial value (\\old(sn)) plus n. Similarly, x must also be equal to its initial value plus n. If sn and x are not equal, then the post-condition must hold.\n\nPutting it all together, the loop invariants for the given program are:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant sn == 0;\n    loop invariant x == 0;\n    loop invariant sn >= 0;\n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant sn >= x;\n    loop invariant (sn == x) ==> (sn == \\old(sn) + n) /\\ (x == \\old(x) + n) /\\ (sn == -1);\n*/\n```",

This is because `sn` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop and starts from 0, whereas `x` is also incremented by 1 in each iteration but starts from an unknown value.

Therefore, we cannot use a loop invariant to prove the post-condition directly.\n- However, we can use an implication to simplify the post-condition. If we assume that `sn` and `x` are equal at the beginning of the loop, then if the loop terminates with `sn` not equal to `x`, it must mean that `sn` has become less than `x` by exactly 1. Therefore, the post-condition can be simplified as follows:\n```\n(sn != x) ==> (sn == x - 1)\n```\n- For the loop invariant, we can use the fact that `sn` and `x` are incremented by 1 in every iteration of the loop. Therefore, we can add the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant sn <= x + 1;\n  loop invariant x <= sn;\n*/\n```\n- The first invariant ensures that `sn` is always at most 1 greater than `x`, while the second invariant ensures that `x` is always at most `sn`. Together, these invariants ensure that `sn` and `x` are always equal or `sn` is 1 greater than `x`.\n- If we assume that `sn` and `x` are equal at the beginning of the loop, then the loop invariants hold true at the beginning of the loop as well. \n- If `sn` and `x` are non-deterministic at the end of the loop, we can use an implication to make the loop invariant trivially true at that location:\n```\n(sn == x) ==> (sn <= x + 1)\n(x == sn) ==> (x <= sn)\n``` \nPutting all the loop invariants together, we get:\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant sn <= x + 1;\n  loop invariant x <= sn;\n  loop invariant (sn == x) ==> (sn <= x + 1);\n  loop invariant (x == sn) ==> (x <= sn);\n*/\n```"

Since both `sn` and `x` are incremented in the same way, they should have the same value.\n\nPutting it all together, we get the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant sn >= 0 && x >= 0;\n    loop invariant sn == \\at(sn, Pre) + \\at(\\sum(sn, Here), Pre==>Here);\n    loop invariant x == \\at(x, Pre) + \\at(\\sum(x, Here), Pre==>Here);\n    loop invariant sn == x;\n*/\n```\nNote that we used the sum of `sn` and `x` from the beginning of the loop until the current iteration, which is denoted by `\\sum(sn, Here)` and `\\sum(x, Here)` respectively. We also used implications to handle the non-deterministic loop condition and make the invariants trivially true at the beginning and end of the loop.",

For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values. Do not use variables that have garbage values.**\n- **Do not use keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops.**\n- **Variables that are not explicitly initialized, could have garbage values. Do not make any assumptions about such values.**\n- **Do not use the \\at(x, Pre) notation for any variable x.**\n- **Do not use non-deterministic function calls.**"

The loop condition in this program is `unknown()`. Since `unknown()` is an external function with no definition, we cannot make any assumptions about its behavior.\n\nMoving on, we need to find loop invariants that are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination, such that the loop invariants imply the post-condition.\n\nBefore the loop execution, we can state the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant \\true; \n*/\n```\nThis invariant is trivially true.\n\nNext, we consider the loop body. The loop body performs two assignments:\n```\n(x = x + 1);\n(sn = sn + 1);\n```\nFrom these assignments, we can see that `x` and `sn` are incremented by 1 in every iteration of the loop. Therefore, we can state the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant x >= 0; \n  loop invariant sn >= 0;\n  loop invariant sn >= x;\n*/\n```\nThe first two invariants are bounds on the variables `x` and `sn` respectively. The third invariant is a relation between the two variables, stating that `sn` is always greater than or equal to `x`.\n\nFinally, we need to find loop invariants that are true after the loop termination. The program contains an assertion that checks if `sn` is not equal to `x`. If this condition is true, the program verifies that `sn` is equal to `-1`. Therefore, we can state the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant sn == x ==> sn == \\old(sn);\n  loop invariant sn != x ==> sn == -1;\n*/\n```\nThe first invariant states that if `sn` is equal to `x` at the end of the loop, then its value must be equal to its value at the beginning of the loop (`\\old(sn)`). The second invariant states that if `sn` is not equal to `x`, then its value must be `-1`.\n\nPutting it all together, the loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant \\true;\n  loop invariant x >= 0; \n  loop invariant sn >= 0;\n  loop invariant sn >= x;\n  loop invariant sn == x ==> sn == \\old(sn);\n  loop invariant sn != x ==> sn == -1;\n*/\n```",

This is because `x` is incremented once in each iteration, whereas `sn` is incremented only if the loop condition is true. Therefore, if the loop terminates, it must be the case that `sn` is less than `x`, and so `x` must have been incremented one more time after the last time `sn` was incremented, making it `-1`.\n- The fourth loop invariant ensures that if `sn` is less than `x` and `sn` is non-negative, then `sn` must be equal to `-1`. This is because `sn` is incremented only if the loop condition is true, and so if the loop terminates, it must be the case that `sn` is less than `x`, and so `sn` must have been incremented one less time than `x`, making it `-1`.\n- The fifth loop invariant ensures that if `sn` is greater than or equal to `x` and `x` is non-negative, then `sn` must be equal to `x`. This is because `x` is incremented once in each iteration, whereas `sn` is incremented only if the loop condition is true.

Thus, we can add an implication to make the first invariant trivially true:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant \\true;\n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant sn >= 0;\n    loop invariant sn != x ==> (sn == -1);\n*/\n```\nNote that we can use `\\true` to indicate that the first invariant holds trivially.\n\n- Since both `x` and `sn` are incremented by `1` in every iteration, we can add the following relation between them:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant \\true;\n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant sn >= 0;\n    loop invariant sn <= x;\n    loop invariant sn != x ==> (sn == -1);\n*/\n```\nThe third invariant `sn <= x` holds since `sn` is incremented by `1` in every iteration, and `x` is incremented by `1` in the same iteration. Thus, `sn` can never be greater than `x`.\n\n- The conjunction of the loop invariants implies the post-condition, since if `sn` is not equal to `x`, then `sn` must be less than `x`, which is covered by the third invariant. If `sn` is equal to `x`, then the post-condition is trivially true.\n\n- Finally, since the loop condition is non-deterministic, we cannot make any assumptions about the values of `x` and `sn` after the loop termination. Thus, we can add an implication to make the last invariant trivially true:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant \\true;\n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant sn >= 0;\n    loop invariant sn <= x;\n    loop invariant sn != x ==> (sn == -1);\n    loop invariant \\forall int i; i >= 0 && i < LIMIT ==> (sn != x);\n*/\n```\nHere, we added an implication that for all values of `i` between `0` and some arbitrary limit `LIMIT`, `sn` is not equal to `x`. This makes the last invariant trivially true, since we cannot make any assumptions about the values of `x` and `sn` after the loop termination. We can choose `LIMIT` to be any value greater than the expected number of loop iterations, since `sn` and `x` can never be equal during the loop execution."

The input to Frama-C is a C program file with ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations.\nFor the given program, find the necessary loop invariants of the while loop to help Frama-C verify the post-condition.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. \n- Output loop invariants that are true \n(i) before the loop execution, \n(ii) in every iteration of the loop and \n(iii) after the loop termination, \nsuch that the loop invariants imply the post condition.\n- If a loop invariant is a conjunction, split it into its parts.\n- Output all the loop invariants in one code block. For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values. Do not use variables that have garbage values.**\n- **Do not use keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops.**\n- **Variables that are not explicitly initialized, could have garbage values.

Hence, `sn >= 0`, `x >= 1` and `sn >= x - 1`.\n- After the loop termination, we know that the loop executed `x` times, because `x` was incremented in each iteration. Therefore, `sn` was incremented `x` times and its final value is equal to `x`.

The loop body assigns new values to `i` and `sn` using the expressions `(i + 1)` and `(sn + 1)` respectively. We need to find loop invariants that capture the relationship between `i` and `sn` during each iteration of the loop. \n\nOne way to do this is to use an implication. We know that before the loop starts, `sn` is equal to 0 and `i` is equal to 1. In each iteration of the loop, `i` is incremented by 1 and `sn` is incremented by 1. Therefore, after `k` iterations of the loop, we have:\n```\nsn == k\ni == k + 1\n```\nWe can use these equations to formulate the loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i <= 9;\n    loop invariant (i - sn) == 1;\n*/\n```\nThe first loop invariant bounds the maximum value of `i` to 9, which is one more than the maximum value of `sn`. The second loop invariant states that the difference between `i` and `sn` is always 1, which holds true for every iteration of the loop.\n\nFinally, we need to find loop invariants that are true after the loop termination. The assertion checks if `sn` is not equal to 8, and if it is not, then the assertion `(sn == 0)` should hold. This means that if the loop terminates normally, then `sn` should be equal to 8. We can use this fact to formulate the loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant (i == 9) ==> (sn == 8);\n*/\n```\nThis loop invariant states that if `i` is equal to 9, then `sn` should be equal to 8.\n\nPutting it all together, we have the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant sn == 0;\n    loop invariant i == 1;\n    loop invariant i <= 9;\n    loop invariant (i - sn) == 1;\n    loop invariant (i == 9) ==> (sn == 8);\n*/\n```"

Since `sn` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, we get `sn == i - 1`. Therefore, `sn < size` implies `i <= size`. This contradicts the fact that `i == size + 1`, which means that `sn == size` must hold. Therefore, `sn != size` implies `sn == 0`. If `sn == size`, then the loop must have executed `size` times, which means that `i == size + 1` and `sn == size` hold. Therefore, the post-condition `sn == 0` does not hold.",

This is true before the loop execution starts, and it remains true in every iteration because the value of `i` is incremented by `1` in each iteration.\n- The second loop invariant specifies that `sn` is always greater than or equal to `0`, and less than or equal to `i-1`. This is true before the loop execution starts, and it remains true in every iteration because the value of `sn` is incremented by `1` in each iteration. Note that the upper bound is `i-1` instead of `i`, because the increment of `sn` happens after the increment of `i`.\n- After the loop terminates, we know that `i > size`, because the loop condition `i <= size` is false. Therefore, we can use this fact to simplify the post-condition. We can rewrite the post-condition `sn != size ==> sn == 0` as `sn != size || sn == 0`. This means that if `sn` is not equal to `size`, then `sn` must be equal to `0`. This is true because the loop invariant `0 <= sn <= i-1` implies that `sn <= size`, and therefore `sn` cannot be greater than `size`. Using this fact, we can derive the following implication:\n  ```\n  sn != size ==> sn <= size\n  ```\n  This is true because if `sn` is not equal to `size`, then it must be less than `size` (by the loop invariant), and therefore `sn <= size`.\n  \n  Now, we can use this implication and the loop invariant `0 <= sn <= i-1` to derive the post-condition:\n  ```\n  0 <= sn <= i-1 ==> sn <= size\n  ```\n  This is true because if `0 <= sn <= i-1` is true, then we know that `sn` is less than or equal to `i-1`, which is less than or equal to `size`. Therefore, `sn` must be less than or equal to `size`. Combining this with the previous implication, we get:\n  ```\n  sn != size || sn == 0 ==> sn <= size\n  ```\n  This implies the original post-condition. Therefore, the loop invariants are:\n  ```\n  /*@\n    loop invariant 1 <= i <= size+1;\n    loop invariant 0 <= sn <= i-1;\n  */\n  ```",

It is true before the loop execution (since i is initialized to 1), in every iteration of the loop (since i is incremented by 1 in each iteration), and after the loop termination (since i is greater than size and the loop condition fails).\n- Loop invariant sn == i - 1 ensures that sn is always the sum of the previous i values. It is true before the loop execution (since sn is initialized to 0 and i is initialized to 1), in every iteration of the loop (since both i and sn are incremented by 1), and after the loop termination (since sn is the sum of all i values and i is greater than size).\n\nHowever, these loop invariants are not sufficient to prove the post-condition. We need to strengthen them. \n\nWe can see that the post-condition is an assertion that checks if sn is equal to size. Since sn is the sum of all i values, we need to find a loop invariant that will bound the maximum value of sn and ensure that it is equal to size.\n\nWe can achieve this by adding a conjunction to the loop invariant for sn that bounds its maximum value:\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 1 <= i <= size + 1;\n    loop invariant 0 <= sn <= size;\n    loop invariant sn == i - 1;\n*/\n\nThis loop invariant is true before the loop execution (since sn is initialized to 0 and size >= 0), in every iteration of the loop (since both i and sn are incremented by 1 and sn is bounded by size), and after the loop termination (since sn is the sum of all i values and i is greater than size).\n\nNow, we need to strengthen the loop invariant to take care of the conditional check after the loop. We can use implication to handle this. The guard condition is sn != size, and the assertion is sn == 0. So, we can add the following loop invariant:\n\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 1 <= i <= size + 1;\n    loop invariant 0 <= sn <= size;\n    loop invariant sn == i - 1;\n    loop invariant (sn != size) ==> (sn == 0);\n*/\n\nThis loop invariant is true before the loop execution (since sn is initialized to 0 and size >= 0), in every iteration of the loop (since both i and sn are incremented by 1 and sn is bounded by size), and after the loop termination (since sn is the sum of all i values and i is greater than size). Moreover, if the guard condition sn != size is true, then the implication is also true and the assertion sn == 0 holds.\n\nFinally, we can add conjunctions that bound the maximum and minimum values of the other variables, if such bounds exist. In this case, there are no bounds on the other variables.\n\nSo, the complete set of loop invariants for the given program is:\n\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 1 <= i <= size + 1;\n    loop invariant 0 <= sn <= size;\n    loop invariant sn == i - 1;\n    loop invariant (sn != size) ==> (sn == 0);\n*/",

It also holds in every iteration of the loop because `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration. It implies that `i` is always positive.\n- `sn >= 0`: This invariant holds before the loop, as `sn` is initialized to 0. It also holds in every iteration of the loop because `sn` is incremented by 1 in each iteration. It implies that `sn` is always non-negative.\n- `sn <= i - 1`: This invariant holds in every iteration of the loop because `sn` is incremented by 1 in each iteration and `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration. It implies that `sn` is always less than or equal to `i - 1`.\n- `i <= size + 1`: This invariant holds before the loop because `i` is initialized to 1 and `size` is assumed to be non-negative. It also holds in every iteration of the loop because `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration and the loop condition is `i <= size`. It implies that `i` is always less than or equal to `size + 1`.\n\nFinally, we can use the loop invariants to verify the post-condition:\n- `sn != size ==> sn == 0`\n\nExplanation:\n- If `sn != size`, then the loop must have terminated early, which means that `i <= size` is no longer true. Therefore, from the invariant `i <= size + 1`, we get `i == size + 1`. Also, from the invariant `sn <= i - 1`, we get `sn <= size`. Therefore, `sn != size` implies `sn < size`. Since `sn` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, we get `sn == i - 1`. Therefore, `sn < size` implies `i <= size`. This contradicts the fact that `i == size + 1`, which means that `sn == size` must hold. Therefore, `sn != size` implies `sn == 0`. If `sn == size`, then the loop must have executed `size` times, which means that `i == size + 1` and `sn == size` hold. Therefore, the post-condition `sn == 0` does not hold.",

This is because in each iteration of the loop, both `x` and `y` are decremented by 1, and hence their sum remains the same.\n- The fourth loop invariant `(x == 0) ==> (y == \\at(y, Pre))` is needed to handle the case where `x` becomes 0 and the loop terminates. This invariant states that if `x` becomes 0, then `y` must be equal to its initial value `\\at(y, Pre)`. This is because in each iteration of the loop, both `x` and `y` are decremented by 1, and hence if `x` becomes 0, then `y` must have been decremented by the same amount, which brings it back to its initial value.\n\nWe can use these loop invariants to prove that the post-condition holds. Here is the proof:\n\n```\n(i == j) ==> (y == 0)\nProof:\nAssume that (i == j).\nFrom the loop invariant x + y == \\at(x, Pre) + \\at(y, Pre), we have:\nx + y == 2 * \\at(y, Pre)\nSince x is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, we have:\nx <= \\at(x, Pre)\nTherefore, we get:\ny >= \\at(y, Pre)\ny <= \\at(y, Pre) + \\at(x, Pre)\nFrom the loop invariant (x == 0) ==> (y == \\at(y, Pre)), we have:\n(y == \\at(y, Pre))\nTherefore, we get:\ny == \\at(y, Pre)\ny == 0\nHence, we have proved the post-condition.\n```",

This is necessary for the post-condition to hold.\n- In every iteration of the loop, we need to ensure that x2 and x3 remain non-negative. If they are both non-negative before the loop iteration, then after the loop iteration, they must still be non-negative. This is captured in the first sub-invariant. The second sub-invariant combines the first sub-invariant with the loop condition. The third sub-invariant states that either x2 or x3 must decrease in each iteration, or x1 must increase. This ensures that the loop will eventually terminate. \n- After the loop termination, if x1 is non-positive, then x2 must be non-negative for the assertion to hold.",

If so, `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` are updated by subtracting `d1`, `d2`, and `d3`, respectively.\n\nNow, let's output the necessary loop invariants:\n- Before the loop execution: Since `x1` is initialized to 1, we can assume that `x1 >= 1`. We can also assume that `x2 >= 0` and `x3 >= 0`.\n- In every iteration of the loop: We can assume that `x1 >= 0`, since it is decremented by `d1` in each iteration. We can also assume that `x2 >= 0` and `x3 >= 0`, since they are only decremented if their original values are greater than 0.\n- After the loop termination: Since the loop terminates when `x1 <= 0`, we can assume that `x1 <= 1`. We also know that `x2` and `x3` are not updated after the loop, so we can assume that `x2 >= 0` and `x3 >= 0`.\n\nPutting it all together, we get the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant x1 >= 0;\n    loop invariant x2 >= 0;\n    loop invariant x3 >= 0;\n    loop invariant x1 <= 1;\n    loop invariant (x2 > 0 && x3 > 0) ==> (x1_old - d1 >= 0 && x2_old - d2 >= 0 && x3_old - d3 >= 0);\n    loop invariant !(x2 > 0 && x3 > 0) ==> (x1 == x1_old && x2 == x2_old && x3 == x3_old);\n*/\n```\nNote that the last two loop invariants are implications, which account for the conditional nature of the code.

This is because the loop body updates x1, x2, and x3 only if both x2 and x3 are greater than 0.
