It states that if `y` is equal to its value at the current loop iteration, then it must be non-zero. This is trivially true at the beginning of the loop since `y` is initially 0. It is also true during the loop because of the `assume(y!=0)` statement.\n- `n > 0`: This loop invariant is always true due to the `assume(n>0)` statement. It provides a bound for the value of `n`."
