Since x is unsigned, it is non-negative, and the loop condition ensures that x will never be greater than 100.\n2. `y <= 101`: This invariant bounds the maximum value that y can take. Since y is always x + 1 and x <= 100, y will never be greater than 101.\n3. `y >= x`: This invariant states that y is always equal to or larger than x. As y is initialized to x + 1 and both x and y are incremented by 1 in each iteration, this invariant holds true.\n4. `y == x + 1`: This invariant asserts the relation between y and x, and it holds true before the loop, during each iteration, and after the loop termination.\n\nThese invariants, when combined, imply the post-condition `x == y`. After the loop termination, x is equal to 100, and y must be equal to 101, which satisfies the invariant `y == x + 1`. Thus, `x == y` is true when the loop terminates."
