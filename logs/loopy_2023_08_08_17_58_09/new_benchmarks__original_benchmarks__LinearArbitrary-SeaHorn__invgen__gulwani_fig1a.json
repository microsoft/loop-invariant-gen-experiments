Before the loop execution, x is assigned -50, and during every iteration, x is increased by y. Since the loop continues only while x is negative, this invariant holds true.\n\n4. `(x >= -50) ==> (x <= y - 1)`: This invariant states that if x is greater than or equal to -50, then x must be less than or equal to y - 1. Before the loop execution, x is assigned -50, and during every iteration, x is increased by y, while y is incremented by 1. Since the loop continues only while x is negative, this invariant holds true.\n\nThese loop invariants take into account the conditional nature of the code and the relationship between the variables. They also imply the post-condition `y > 0` after the loop termination."

After the loop termination: When the loop terminates, x >= 0, and from the invariants, we know that y >= \\at(y, Pre) and x <= \\at(x, Pre), so we can conclude that y > 0, which is the post-condition.
