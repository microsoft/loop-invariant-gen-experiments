Before the loop execution: Both `x` and `y` are assigned non-deterministic integer values. Therefore, any loop invariant we define now, would not be very useful. \n\n2. In every iteration of the loop: The loop condition `(x > 0 && x < y)` ensures that `x` is positive and less than `y`. In each iteration, `x` is doubled and `y` is incremented by 1.

This invariant supports the loop variant `(y - x)`, as it implies that `(y - x)` decreases with every loop iteration.\n\nNote: The ACSL specifications do not support the use of a variable to represent the current loop iteration number. However, the intent here is to illustrate the relationship between `x` and `y` throughout the loop execution.

In the first iteration, x is doubled, so x is decreasing in the first iteration. We can choose x as the first expression in the ranking function.\n2. Once x becomes non-positive or x >= y, the loop terminates. However, before that happens, y is increasing in every iteration. So, we can choose y - x as the second expression in the ranking function because it decreases once x becomes greater than or equal to y.\n\nPutting it all together, the multi-phase ranking function for the given loop is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n    loop variant y - x;\n*/\n```",

In this case, we can choose `-x` as the first expression because as `x` increases, `-x` decreases.\n\nNow, we need to find a second expression that decreases once the first expression becomes zero or negative. Here, we can choose `y - x` as the second expression. This is because when `-x` becomes non-positive, `x` will be greater than or equal to `y`. Since `y` is increasing by 1 and `x` is doubling, `y - x` will decrease in the following iterations.\n\nSo, we have a multi-phase ranking function: `(-x, y - x)`.\n\nNow, let's write the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant -x;\n    loop variant y - x;\n*/\n```\n\nThis is a valid multi-phase ranking function because:\n\n1. `-x` decreases with every iteration of the loop as `x` doubles.\n2.

For the first expression, we need to find an expression that immediately decreases with every iteration of the loop. Since `x` is doubled in each iteration, the expression `y - x` decreases with each iteration. So, the first expression of the ranking function is `y - x`.\n\n2. For the second expression, we need to find an expression that decreases once the first expression becomes zero or negative. When `y - x` becomes non-positive, it means `x >= y`. Since `x` is always doubled and `y` is incremented by 1, the difference between `y` and `x` will continue to decrease, and the loop will eventually terminate when `x` is no longer less than `y`.\n\nHence, the multi-phase ranking function for the given loop is:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant y - x;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because it ensures that the loop terminates when the condition `x < y` is no longer satisfied, and the expression `y - x` decreases with each iteration of the loop.",

The first expression should be `y - x`, as it immediately decreases with every iteration of the loop. During each iteration, `x` is doubled, and `y` is incremented by 1. So, the difference between `y` and `x` will decrease.\n\n2. For the second expression, we can use `x`. Once the first expression `y - x` becomes non-positive, it means that `x >= y`. At this point, `x` will keep increasing (as it is multiplied by 2 in every iteration), and `y` will also keep increasing (as it is incremented by 1). However, since `x` is growing faster than `y`, the value of `x` will be decreasing relative to `y`.\n\nThe multi-phase ranking function for the loop in the given program is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant y - x;\n    loop variant x;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because the first expression (`y - x`) decreases with successive iterations of the loop until it becomes non-positive, and then the second expression (`x`) decreases in relative terms until the loop terminates.",

Here, `x` and `y` are the variables live at the loop head, but their starting values are unknown.\n\nNext, we analyze the loop body. The loop condition is `x > 0 && x < y`. Inside the loop, `x` is doubled and `y` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.\n\nThe given ranking function is `(y - x, x)`. This is a lexicographic ranking function where `y - x` needs to decrease, or if it remains the same, `x` needs to decrease.\n\nThe loop invariants that support this ranking function and prove the termination of the loop are as follows:\n\n```c\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant y > x;\n    loop invariant y <= \\at(y, LoopEntry) + 1;\n    loop invariant x <= 2 * \\at(x, LoopEntry);\n*/\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `x >= 0`: This invariant is true before the loop execution (since `x > 0` is a part of the loop condition), remains true in every iteration (since `x` is doubled, it remains non-negative), and is true after the loop termination.\n- `y > x`: This invariant is true before the loop execution (since `x < y` is a part of the loop condition), remains true in every iteration (since `x` is doubled and `y` is incremented by 1, `y` remains greater than `x`), and is true after the loop termination.\n- `y <= \\at(y, LoopEntry) + 1`: This invariant is true before the loop execution (since `y` is not changed before the loop), remains true in every iteration (since `y` is incremented by 1), and is true after the loop termination.\n- `x <= 2 * \\at(x, LoopEntry)`: This invariant is true before the loop execution (since `x` is not changed before the loop), remains true in every iteration (since `x` is doubled), and is true after the loop termination.",
                    "First, the loop condition is `x > 0 && x < y`.\n\nSecond, the ranking function is `(y - x, x)`, which is a lexicographic ranking function.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body:\n\n- `x` is multiplied by `2` in each iteration, so it is increasing.\n- `y` is incremented by `1` in each iteration, so it is also increasing.\n\nBut we know that `x` is always less than `y` due to the loop condition `x < y`. So, even though both `x` and `y` increase, `x` increases at a faster rate than `y`.\n\nThis means that `y - x` decreases in each iteration until `x >= y`, at which point the loop terminates. Also, since `x` is always positive and increasing, the second component of the lexicographic ranking function always decreases.\n\nThis allows us to infer the following loop invariants:\n\n- Before the loop execution: `x > 0 && x < y`\n- In every iteration of the loop: `x > \\at(x, LoopEntry) && y > \\at(y, LoopEntry) && \\at(y, LoopEntry) - x < y - x`\n- After the loop termination: `x >= y`\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants that prove the ranking function are:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x > 0;\n    loop invariant x < y;\n    loop invariant \\at(y, LoopEntry) - x < y - x;\n    loop invariant x > \\at(x, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant y > \\at(y, LoopEntry);\n*/\n```",

However, we know that `x` and `y` are integers.\n\nThe loop condition is `x > 0 && x < y`, meaning the loop will execute as long as `x` is positive and less than `y`.\n\nThe loop body doubles `x` and increments `y`.\n\nThe given ranking function is `(y - x, x)`. This is a lexicographic ranking function. The first component `y - x` decreases when `x` is doubled and `y` is incremented by 1. If `y - x` remains the same, the second component `x` decreases because `x` is doubled in every iteration.\n\nThe loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant y > x;\n    loop invariant \\at(x, LoopEntry) <= x;\n    loop invariant \\at(y, LoopEntry) <= y;\n*/\n```",

Hence, we cannot make any assumption about their initial values.\n\n- The loop condition is `x > 0 && x < y`. Hence, before the loop execution and in every iteration, `x` is positive and less than `y`.\n\n- The loop body multiplies `x` by 2 and increments `y`. Hence, `x` will increase and `y` will increase in every iteration of the loop.\n\n- The ranking function is `(y - x, x)`. To ensure that this ranking function decreases in every iteration, `y - x` should decrease or remain the same, and if `y - x` remains the same, `x` should decrease. However, `x` is increasing in every iteration. Hence, to ensure that the ranking function decreases, `y - x` should decrease in every iteration.\n\n- After the loop termination, `x` will be non-positive or not less than `y`.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the following are the loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant \\at(x, LoopEntry) >= 0;\n    loop invariant \\at(x, LoopEntry) < \\at(y, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant x >= \\at(x, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant y >= \\at(y, LoopEntry) + 1;\n    loop invariant y - x <= \\at(y, LoopEntry) - \\at(x, LoopEntry);\n*/\n```",
