Since x is being doubled and incremented by y in each iteration, n - x can be the first expression because it will decrease as x increases. Moreover, it will be positive as long as the loop condition holds (x <= n).\n\nNow, let's find the second expression. Since y is updated to z and z is incremented by 1 in every iteration, the second expression should involve z. We need the second expression to decrease when the first expression remains constant. Since the loop condition requires x + y >= 0, we can use y as the second expression because it will be positive as long as the loop condition holds, and it will decrease as y is updated to the previous value of z, which is smaller than the new value of z.\n\nThe lexicographic ranking function for this loop is (n - x, y).\n\nIn ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant n - x;\n    loop variant y;\n*/\n```",

The first expression should be positive and decrease with every iteration. Since `x` is bounded by `n`, we can use `n - x` as the first expression. It is positive while the loop is executing, and it will decrease since `x` is increasing in each iteration.\n\n2. If the first expression remains constant, the second expression should be positive and decrease. We can use `-y` as the second expression. It will be positive if `y` is negative, and it will decrease with every iteration since `y` is updated to the value of `z`, which is incremented in each iteration.\n\nSo, the lexicographic ranking function for the loop is `(n - x, -y)`:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant n - x;\n    loop variant -y;\n*/\n```",

Since y is updated to z in every iteration and z is incremented by 1, we can use z as the second expression in the lexicographic ranking function.\n\nHence, the lexicographic ranking function for the loop is (n - x, z).

A ranking function can be used to prove that a loop terminates.\nA multi-phase ranking function is a sequence of ranking functions that can be used to prove termination of a loop.\nIn a multi-phase ranking function, the first expression decreases with successive iterations of the loop, and when it becomes non-positive, the second expression decreases and so on.\nFor example, if (e1, e2, e3) is a multi-phase ranking function, we begin with e1 being positive. Once e1 becomes non-positive, we move on to e2, which decreases with every loop iteration. Once e2 becomes non-positive, we move on to e3 which decreases till it becomes non-positive and the loop terminates.\nFind the multi-phase ranking function for the loop in the following program and explain why it is a valid ranking function.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make note of the starting values or constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head.\n- Analyze the loop body and find a ranking function such that:\n    - The first expression decreases in the first iteration of the loop and continues to decrease\n    - The second expression decreases once the first expression becomes zero or negative\n    - so on... till the last expression decreases till the loop terminates.\n- Output the ranking function in one code block, in ACSL syntax, in the order they decrease, in different lines. For example,\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant v1;\n    loop variant v2;\n*/\n```\n\nRules:\n- **Do not use constants or functions not defined in the program. Use the ternary operator to describe the absolute value of an expression.**"
