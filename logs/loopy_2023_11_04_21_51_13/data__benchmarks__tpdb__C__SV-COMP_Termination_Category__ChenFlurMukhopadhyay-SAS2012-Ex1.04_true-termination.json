This is a consequence of the conditional break in the loop.",
                    "First, let's take note of the starting values and constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head. We have:\n\n- `x` is an integer that starts with an unknown value.\n\nThe loop condition is `x > 1`, meaning the loop continues as long as `x` is greater than 1.\n\nThe given ranking function is `x`, which means that `x` should decrease with every iteration of the loop for the loop to terminate.\n\nNext, let's analyze the loop body. The loop body contains a conditional statement that breaks the loop if `2*x` is greater than `old_x`.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can come up with the following loop invariants:\n\n- `x` is always greater than 1 throughout the loop execution.\n- The value of `x` at the start of the loop iteration is always greater than or equal to the value of `x` at the end of the loop iteration.\n- If `2*x` is greater than `old_x`, then the loop breaks.\n\nWe can express these loop invariants in ACSL as follows:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= \\at(x, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant x > 1;\n    loop invariant \\at(x, LoopEntry) > x ==> 2*x > \\at(x, LoopEntry);\n*/\n```\n\nThese loop invariants imply that the ranking function `x` decreases with every iteration, and therefore support the termination of the loop.",
                    "First, let's look at the loop condition. The loop continues as long as `x > 1`. So at the start of every loop iteration, we know that `x > 1`. Also, the ranking function is `x`, which is initially non-negative and decreases with every loop iteration.\n\nIn the body of the loop, `x` is reassigned to a value from `unknown_int()`, which could be any integer. However, if `2*x > old_x`, the loop breaks. Therefore, in every iteration where the loop does not break, `2*x <= old_x`.\n\nThis gives us the following loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x > 1;\n    loop invariant 2*x <= \\at(old_x, LoopEntry);\n*/\n```\n\nThese loop invariants are true before the loop execution (since `x` is a non-negative integer larger than 1, and the second invariant holds because `old_x` is not yet defined), during every iteration of the loop (because the loop continues as long as `x > 1` and `2*x <= old_x`), and after the loop termination (since the loop only exits when `x <= 1` or `2*x > old_x`).\n\nThese invariants imply that the ranking function `x` decreases with every iteration, because in each iteration `x` is assigned a value that is at most half of its previous value. Therefore, these invariants can be used to prove the termination of the loop.",
                    "The loop in the program has the condition `x > 1`, and the given ranking function is `x`.\n\nThe loop body updates `x` to a potentially arbitrary value, but it breaks the loop if the new value of `x` is more than half the old value. Therefore, if the loop continues, `x` must have decreased by at least a factor of 2.\n\nHere are the loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant \\at(x, LoopEntry) > 1;\n    loop invariant x <= \\at(x, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant x > 0;\n*/\n```\n\nThe loop invariant `\\at(x, LoopEntry) > 1` is true before the loop execution because it is the loop condition.\n\nThe loop invariant `x <= \\at(x, LoopEntry)` is true in every iteration of the loop because `x` is either set to a value less than or equal to half of its previous value, or the loop terminates.\n\nThe loop invariant `x > 0` is true in every iteration of the loop because `x` is always decreased by a factor of 2, and it starts from a value greater than 1.\n\nThese loop invariants imply that the ranking function `x` decreases with every iteration of the loop, which proves the termination of the loop."
