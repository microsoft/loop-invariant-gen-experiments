This means that `j` cycles from 0 to `m` for every increment of `i`.\n\nTaking the live variables at the loop head, we can see that `i`, `j`, `n` and `m` are live. \n\nWe can observe the following facts about these variables:\n\n1. `i` is always non-negative and less than `n`. Furthermore, `i` strictly increases in some iterations (when `j = m`), thus it is bounded above by `n`.\n\n2. `j` is always non-negative and less than `m`. Furthermore, `j` strictly increases in some iterations (when `j < m`), and resets to zero in others (when `j = m`), thus it is bounded above by `m`.\n\nFrom these observations, we can construct the following lexicographic ranking function: `(n - i, m - j)`.\n\nThis lexicographic ranking function is valid because:\n\n1. `n - i` is always positive and decreases whenever `j = m`.\n2. `m - j` is always positive and decreases whenever `j < m`.\n\nIn ACSL syntax, the ranking function can be written as:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant n - i;\n    loop variant m - j;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function helps prove termination as it ensures that progress is made in each iteration of the loop, either by decreasing `n - i` or `m - j`."
