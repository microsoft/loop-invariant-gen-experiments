            "At the beginning, both `x` and `y` are initialized to 0. In the loop, `x` always increases by 1, and `y` increases by 1 when `x` is less than or equal to 50, and decreases by 1 otherwise. The loop continues as long as `y` is not negative. \n\nIn this case, the ranking function could be `y`. \n\nLet's consider why `y` is a valid ranking function:\n\n- `y` is always positive or zero during the loop execution, as required.\n- `y` increases when `x <= 50`, but once `x > 50`, `y` starts to decrease by 1 in each iteration. So, after `x` exceeds 50, `y` is a decreasing function, as required.\n\nThus, `y` is a valid ranking function for the given program.\n\nWe can express the ranking function in ACSL as follows:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant y;\n*/\n```",
            "Firstly, we observe that `x` increases by 1 in every iteration of the loop and `y` increases by 1 when `x` is less than or equal to 50, and decreases by 1 otherwise. The loop continues as long as `y` is non-negative.\n\nNext, we note that `x` and `y` are both initialized to 0 and `x` is incremented by 1 in every iteration. This means that `x` will eventually exceed 50 and cause `y` to decrease. Hence, `y` will eventually become negative and terminate the loop.\n\nTherefore, a ranking function can be `51 - x + y`:\n\n- It is positive at the start of the loop (since `x` and `y` are both 0), and it is non-negative during the loop execution (since `y` is non-negative and `x` is less than or equal to 50).\n- It decreases in every iteration: when `x` is less than or equal to 50, `y` increases by 1 and `x` increases by 1, so the ranking function decreases by 1; when `x` is greater than 50, `y` decreases by 1 and `x` increases by 1, so the ranking function decreases by 2.\n\nThe resulting ACSL annotation would be:\n\n```c\n/*@\n    loop variant 51 - x + y;\n*/\n```",
            "The loop continues to run until `y` becomes negative. At the start, `y` is 0. For every iteration of the loop, `y` increases by 1 until `x` becomes greater than 50. After `x` exceeds 50, `y` decreases by 1 in each iteration.\n\nSo, the ranking function that helps to prove that the loop must terminate is `y`. The value of `y` is always positive as long as the loop continues to execute. Once `y` becomes negative, the loop ends. Therefore, `y` is a valid ranking function for this loop.\n\nLet's denote this in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant y;\n*/\n```",
            "The variables that are live at the loop head are `x` and `y`. At the beginning, both `x` and `y` are initialized to 0. \n\nIn the loop body, `x` is incremented in each iteration. `y` is incremented when `x` is less than or equal to 50, and decremented when `x` is greater than 50. The loop breaks when `y` becomes negative. \n\nOne possible ranking function would be `51 - x` when `x <= 50`, since this expression decreases as `x` increases, and is positive while the loop is executing. When `x > 50`, `y` becomes the ranking function as it decreases with each iteration and the loop breaks when `y` is negative.\n\nTherefore, the ranking function in ACSL syntax would be:\n\n```c\n/*@\n    loop variant (x <= 50) ?

Inside the loop, if `x <= 50`, `y` is incremented; otherwise, `y` is decremented. `x` is always incremented.\n\n4. Since `x` is always incremented, it will eventually surpass 50, and `y` will start to decrement. When `y` becomes negative, the loop terminates.\n\nNow let's find a lexicographic ranking function for this loop:\n\n1. First, notice that the value of `x` always increases and does not have an upper bound. Therefore, we can use `x` as the first ranking function expression.\n\n2. Second, the value of `y` increases while `x <= 50` and decreases while `x > 50`. Since we need the ranking function to be positive and decreasing, we can use `51 - x` as the second expression when `x <= 50`. When `x > 50`, we want the value to decrease, so we can use `y`.\n\nSo the lexicographic ranking function for this loop can be represented as:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n    loop variant x <= 50 ? 51 - x : y;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because:\n\n1. `x` is always positive and increasing.\n2.
