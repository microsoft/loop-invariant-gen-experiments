The value of `z` remains unchanged throughout the loop.\n\nThe loop continues as long as `x + y >= 0` and `x <= z`. This suggests that the loop will terminate when `x + y` is less than 0 or `x` is more than `z`. Thus, the loop may execute a maximum of `z - x + 1` times if `x + y` remains greater than or equal to 0.\n\nWe can construct the ranking function based on the difference `z - x + 1`. This function will decrease with each iteration as `x` is increased, and will always be positive as long as `x` remains less than or equal to `z`.\n\nHere is the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant z - x + 1;\n*/\n```",

It decreases with every iteration, as `x` is constantly increasing. Also, it is positive as long as `x <= z`, which is one of the loop conditions.\n\nSo, the ranking function for this loop is `z - x`.\n\nHere is the ACSL specification of this ranking function:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant z - x;\n*/\n```\n\nThis is a valid ranking function because it decreases with every iteration of the loop and is positive as long as the loop continues executing.

Therefore, the loop will eventually terminate when `x + y` is no longer greater than or equal to `0` or when `x` is greater than `z`.\n\nThe variant function should be one which decreases with every iteration of the loop and remains positive while the loop is executing. A suitable function is `z - x`, because `z` is constant and `x` is increasing.

                    "Firstly, let's take note of the starting values or constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head, that is, `x`, `y`, and `z`. All of them are initialized with `unknown_int()`, so we do not have any initial constraints on their values.\n\nThe loop condition is `x + y >= 0 && x <= z`. The loop body updates `x` and `y` in each iteration: `x` is doubled and `y` is incremented. The value of `z` remains unchanged.\n\nThe lexicographic ranking function is given as `(z - x, -y)`. This means that in each iteration, `z - x` should decrease or if it stays the same, `-y` should decrease.\n\nIn order to support this ranking function, the loop invariants can be:\n- Before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop, `x <= z`. This is required so that `z - x` is non-negative.\n- In every iteration of the loop, `x + y >= 0`. This is the loop condition and it ensures that the loop can continue.\n- In every iteration of the loop, `y` is less than or equal to the value of `y` at the beginning of the loop. This is because `y` is incremented in each iteration. This ensures that `-y` decreases with each iteration.\n\nThe loop invariants can be written as follows:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x <= z;\n    loop invariant x + y >= 0;\n    loop invariant y <= \\at(y, LoopEntry);\n*/\n```",
                    "The loop invariants that support the loop variant (z - x, -y) are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x + y >= 0;\n    loop invariant x <= z;\n    loop invariant x == \\at(x, LoopEntry) * 2 + \\at(y, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant y == \\at(y, LoopEntry) + 1;\n    loop invariant z == \\at(z, LoopEntry);\n*/\n```",
                    "Firstly, let's make note of the variables that are live at the head of the loop: **x, y, z**. The loop condition is **x + y >= 0 && x <= z**.\n\nThe loop variant provided is **(z - x, -y)**. This is a lexicographic loop variant, meaning it consists of two expressions which decrease lexicographically. \n\nThe first expression, **z - x**, decreases whenever **x** increases (since z is not modified in the loop). The second expression, **-y**, decreases whenever **y** increases. \n\nNow, let's try to find the loop invariants that support this loop variant. The loop invariants we are looking for need to be true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop and after the loop termination.\n\n- Before the loop execution, we know that **z - x >= 0**, because **x <= z** is a part of the loop condition. This loop invariant supports the first part of our lexicographic loop variant.\n\n- During every iteration of the loop, **x** is increased by **2*x + y** and **y** is increased by **1**. This means that **x** and **y** are always increasing, which supports our loop variant.\n\n- Finally, after the loop termination, we know that **x + y < 0 || x > z**. This supports our loop variant, because if **x** is greater than **z**, **z - x** is negative. And if **x + y** is less than 0, then **-y** is positive (and since **y** is increasing, **-y** must be decreasing).\n\nSo, the loop invariants that support the loop variant are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant z - x >= 0;\n    loop invariant x == \\at(x, LoopEntry) * (2^(\\at(y, LoopEntry) - y));\n    loop invariant y == \\at(y, LoopEntry) + 1;\n    loop invariant x + y < 0 || x > z;\n*/\n```\nThese loop invariants are true before the loop execution, during every iteration of the loop and after the loop termination.
