We can see that in each iteration, either `x` or `y` is decreased by 1, depending on the value of `z`. Additionally, the other variable is increased by the value of `z`. This means that the sum `x + y` will always be greater than 0.\n\nWe can use the sum `x + y` as the first expression in our lexicographic ranking function. Since either `x` or `y` decreases in each iteration, the sum `x + y` will also decrease.\n\nAs the second expression, we can use the absolute difference `|x - y|`, as it will decrease whenever the first expression remains constant. Note that when `x > y`, the difference is `x - y`, and when `y > x`, the difference is `y - x`. We can express the absolute difference using the ternary operator: `(x > y) ?

There are two cases in the loop body, one when `unknown_int()` returns true and the other when it returns false:\n\n1. `unknown_int()` returns true:\n   - y = y + x\n   - x = z - 1\n   - z = y + z\n\n2. `unknown_int()` returns false:\n   - x = y + x\n   - y = z - 1\n   - z = x + z\n\nIn both cases, either x or y is increased by the value of the other variable, and the other variable is decreased by 1.

In the first branch, y = y + x and x = z - 1. In the second branch, x = y + x and y = z - 1. In both cases, x and y are updated, and their values will change.\n\nA possible lexicographic ranking function would be (x, y), since x and y are positive integers at the loop head and their values change in the loop body. However, we need to make sure that the ranking function decreases in the loop. Let's look at the loop body in more detail.\n\nIn the first branch, the value of x is decreased by 1, and the value of y is increased. In the second branch, the value of y is decreased by 1, and the value of x is increased. Since x and y cannot both increase simultaneously, at least one of them will decrease in each iteration of the loop.\n\nThus, the lexicographic ranking function for the loop in the given program is (x, y).

In both branches, the variables `x` and `y` are updated. We need to find expressions that decrease in each iteration.\n\n   Let's consider the first branch (when `unknown_int()` is true):\n   ```\n   y = y+x;\n   x = z-1;\n   z = y+z;\n   ```\n   In this case, the new value of `x` is `z-1`, and since `z` is either `x` or `y`, the value of `x` will decrease in this branch.\n\n   Now, let's consider the second branch (when `unknown_int()` is false):\n   ```\n   x = y+x;\n   y = z-1;\n   z = x+z;\n   ```\n   In this case, the new value of `y` is `z-1`, and since `z` is either `x` or `y`, the value of `y` will decrease in this branch.\n\n   So, the lexicographic ranking function for this loop will be `(x, y)`.\n\n3.

This holds because `x` is initialized to a non-deterministic value and is updated either by summing it with `y` (which is also non-negative) or by decreasing `z` (which is non-negative and always less than or equal to `x`).\n\n2. `y >= 0`: Similarly, the value of `y` is always non-negative.\n\n3. `z >= 0`: The value of `z` is always non-negative. This holds because `z` is initialized to a non-negative value (either `x` or `y`) and is updated by summing it with `x` or `y` (which are non-negative).\n\n4. `x + y >= \\at(x + y, LoopEntry)`: The sum `x + y` never increases. This holds because in every iteration of the loop, `x + y` either stays the same or decreases.\n\n5. `(x + y == \\at(x + y, LoopEntry)) ==> z < \\at(z, LoopEntry)`: If `x + y` stays the same, then `z` decreases. This holds because when `x + y` stays the same, it means that one of `x` or `y` has been decreased by `z - 1`, so `z` must have decreased. \n\nThese loop invariants prove that the ranking function `(x + y, z)` is valid and that the loop terminates.",

The loop body has an `if-else` condition, and the variable `z` is updated in both branches. In both cases, `z` is set to the smaller value of `x` and `y`. Also, `x` or `y` is then updated to `z-1` and `z` is updated to be `x+z` or `y+z`, which means that the value of `z` is always less than the sum of `x` and `y` at the end of each loop iteration.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants that support the validity of the ranking function and prove the termination of the loop are:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x > 0;\n    loop invariant y > 0;\n    loop invariant z >= 0;\n    loop invariant z <= x + y;\n*/\n```\nThese invariants hold true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.

This is true because in each iteration, x and y are either unchanged or increased. And since x and y are non-negative at the start of the program, they remain non-negative throughout the program.\n\nNext, we can note that:\n- The sum of x and y at the start of the loop is always less than or equal to the sum of x and y at the end of the loop. This is because in each loop iteration, either x or y is reduced by at least 1, while the other is increased.

If y is greater than x at the start of the loop, then y - x decreases in every loop iteration.
