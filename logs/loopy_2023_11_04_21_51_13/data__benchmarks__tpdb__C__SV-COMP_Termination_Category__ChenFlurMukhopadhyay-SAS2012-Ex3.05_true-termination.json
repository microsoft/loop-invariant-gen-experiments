            "At the start of the program, the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned unknown integer values. The loop continues executing as long as `x` is nonnegative and less than or equal to `z`. \n\nInside the loop, `x` is incremented by `2*x + y`, and `y` is incremented by `1`. Thus, `x` increases more rapidly than `y` in each iteration, and `x` is always nonnegative as long as the loop continues executing.\n\nThe ranking function for this loop can be `z - x`. This function is a valid ranking function for the following reasons:\n\n- It is positive as long as the loop continues executing, because `x` is always less than or equal to `z` in each iteration.\n- It decreases in each iteration because `x` is incremented by `2*x + y`, which is always greater than or equal to `x`. \n\nTherefore, the ranking function in ACSL syntax would be:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant z - x;\n*/\n```",
            "The loop guard is `x >= 0 && x <= z`. Therefore, `x` and `z` are the variables that are live at the loop head. \n\nIn the loop body, `x` is updated as `x = 2*x + y;` and `y` is incremented by one in each iteration as `y++;`. \n\nHowever, the loop guard does not involve `y`, so it is not necessary to include `y` in the ranking function. \n\nThe loop continues as long as `x` is less than or equal to `z` and `x` is greater or equal to 0. For each iteration, `x` increases, so the difference `z - x` decreases. Therefore, `z - x` is a potential ranking function because it is positive as long as the loop continues and it decreases with each iteration. \n\nTherefore, the ranking function is `z - x`.\n\nThis function is valid because it is positive as long as the loop is executing (since `x <= z`), and it decreases with every iteration of the loop (since `x` increases with every iteration). \n\nSo, in ACSL syntax, the ranking function is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant z - x;\n*/\n```",

This function decreases with each iteration, as `x` increases, and is positive as long as the loop continues executing (`x <= z`). \n\nIn ACSL syntax, we could write:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant z - x;\n*/\n```",

This means that in each iteration, `x` is increasing and `y` is also increasing. \n\nWe need a ranking function that decreases with each iteration of the loop, and it needs to be positive for the loop to continue executing. \n\nConsidering the constraints and the updates in the loop, a possible ranking function for this loop could be `z - x`.

Also, initially x can be any value returned by unknown_int() function, and we are not making any assumptions about this function. \n- y is non-decreasing.

The loop stops executing when `x > z`.\n- `x >= 0`: Similar to the previous invariant, this holds because of the loop condition.\n- `\\at(y, LoopEntry) <= y`: The variable `y` is incremented in each loop iteration, so its value is always greater than or equal to its initial value.\n- `\\at(x, LoopEntry) <= x`: The variable `x` is also incremented in each loop iteration, so its value is always greater than or equal to its initial value.\n- `x <= 2*\\at(x, LoopEntry) + y - 1`: This invariant holds because the value of `x` in each iteration is at most `2*x + y - 1` where `x` and `y` are their values at the start of the iteration."

The initial values of x, y, and z are unknown.\n\nNext, analyze the loop body to find a ranking function. \nIn the loop body, x is increased and y is incremented. The loop continues as long as x is less than or equal to z and greater than or equal to 0. \n\nIn this case, we can see that the value of x increases with every iteration and y also increases. However, z remains constant throughout the loop. \n\nFor the ranking function, we can consider (z - x, -y).\n\nFor the first expression (z - x), we can see that as x increases, the value of (z - x) decreases, which satisfies the requirement for the first expression in the ranking function. \n\nFor the second expression (-y), as y increases with every iteration, the value of (-y) decreases. So, this satisfies the requirement for the second expression in the ranking function.\n\nTherefore, the lexicographic ranking function for the loop in the program is (z - x, -y).\n\nHere is the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant z - x;\n    loop variant -y;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because it fulfills the requirements of a lexicographic ranking function and helps prove the termination of the loop.",

If `z - x` stays the same (which is unlikely as `x` is being increased), the second expression `-y` is positive and decreases as `y` is increased.\n\nTherefore, the ranking function `(z - x, -y)` proves that the loop terminates.

Since x is being updated as 2*x+y, it is not guaranteed to decrease with every iteration. Similarly, y is increasing with every iteration. However, the value z-x will decrease in every iteration as x is either staying the same or increasing, so z-x can be the first expression of the ranking function.\n\nOnce z-x becomes non-positive, meaning x is greater than or equal to z, the loop will not terminate until x becomes negative.

This makes `x` increase or decrease non-deterministically depending on the value of `y`. On the other hand, `y` is deterministically incremented by 1 in every loop iteration. \n\nThe loop termination condition is `x >= 0 && x <= z`. When `x` becomes negative or greater than `z`, the loop terminates. \n\nTherefore, a valid multi-phase ranking function for this loop could be `(z - x, -y)`. \n\nHere, `(z - x)` is the first expression that decreases in every loop iteration because `x` is increasing.

In each iteration of the loop, `x` is updated to `2*x + y` and `y` is incremented by 1.\n\nThe first loop variant we can take is `z - x`, as `x` is guaranteed to increase with each iteration (as `x` is updated to `2*x + y` and `y` is always positive), so `z - x` will decrease with each iteration, until `x` becomes greater than `z` at which point the loop will terminate.\n\nThe second loop variant we can take is `-y`, as `y` is always incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, `-y` will always decrease.\n\nSo the multi-phase ranking function for this loop can be `(z - x, -y)`.\n\nThis is the ACSL syntax for the multi-phase ranking function:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant z - x;\n    loop variant -y;\n*/\n```\n\nThis is a valid ranking function as the first expression `z - x` decreases with each loop iteration until it becomes non-positive at which point the second expression `-y` starts to decrease with each loop iteration until the loop terminates.

            "The live variables at the loop head are x, y, and z. \n\nIn each iteration of the loop, x is updated to 2*x + y and y is incremented by one. Therefore, x is not decreasing with every loop iteration. However, for the loop to terminate, x must eventually exceed z (since the loop condition is x >= 0 && x <= z). \n\nThis leads us to the first part of our ranking function: z - x. This expression is positive at the beginning (as per the loop condition) and decreases with every iteration of the loop (as x increases). When z - x becomes non-positive, it means x has exceeded z and the loop terminates. \n\nHowever, this is not enough to prove termination as x can also become negative, causing the loop to terminate. So, we need another part in our ranking function to consider this case. Here, we can use x itself. If x becomes negative, the loop terminates. So, the second part of our ranking function is x.\n\nFinally, the third part of our ranking function is to consider the case when x and z are equal but y is still increasing. As y is incremented in each iteration, we can use -y as the third part of our ranking function.\n\nSo the multi-phase ranking function is (z - x, x, -y).\n\nThis is a valid ranking function because:\n1. All expressions are initially non-negative.\n2. At least one of the expressions strictly decreases in each iteration.\n3. When any of the expressions becomes negative, the loop terminates.\n\nHere's the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant z - x;\n    loop variant x;\n    loop variant -y;\n*/\n```",
            "The variables live at the loop head are `x`, `y`, and `z`.\n\nIn the loop, `x` is being updated as `x = 2*x + y` and `y` is being incremented by one. \n\nWe can observe that `z - x` is decreasing in each loop iteration because `x` is increasing. So, `z - x` could be a candidate for the first expression in our ranking function.\n\nHowever, once `x` becomes greater than `z`, `z - x` will become negative and stop decreasing. At this point, we need to switch to another expression that is guaranteed to decrease. \n\nNotice that once `x > z`, `x` will keep increasing since `x = 2*x + y` and `y` is always positive. Therefore, `-x` will keep decreasing and could serve as the second expression in our ranking function.\n\nIn ACSL syntax, the multi-phase ranking function can be written as:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant z - x;\n    loop variant -x;\n*/\n```\n\nThis is a valid multi-phase ranking function because `z - x` is decreasing while `x` is less than or equal to `z` and `-x` is decreasing once `x` becomes greater than `z`.

So the loop continues as long as `x` is non-negative and less than or equal to `z`.\n\nThe loop variant `(z - x, -x)` is a lexicographic ranking function.

This is true because `y` increases by 1 in each iteration.\n- `z` remains constant throughout the loop.\n- `x` is non-negative throughout the loop.\n- `x` is less than or equal to `z` throughout the loop.\n- `y` is non-negative throughout the loop.",

The starting values of these variables are unknown, but we know that x is non-negative and less than or equal to z at the beginning of the loop.\n\nThe loop condition is `x >= 0 && x <= z`.\n\nNow consider the given ranking function (z - x, -x) and the loop body. The first part of the ranking function, z - x, is non-negative and decreases with every iteration as x increases with every iteration. The second part of the ranking function, -x, is non-positive and decreases with every iteration as x increases with every iteration.\n\nLet's identify the loop invariants that support these observations:\n- `x >= 0` is true before the loop, in every iteration, and after termination. This supports the ranking function because if x was not non-negative, the ranking function might not be non-negative.\n- `x <= z` is true before the loop and in every iteration, but not necessarily after termination. This supports the ranking function because if x was not less than or equal to z, the first part of the ranking function might not be non-negative.\n- `x <= \\at(x, LoopEntry) * 2 + \\at(y, LoopEntry)` is true in every iteration and after termination. This supports the ranking function because it guarantees that x increases with every iteration.\n\nSo, the loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant x <= z;\n    loop invariant x <= \\at(x, LoopEntry) * 2 + \\at(y, LoopEntry);\n*/\n```",

The loop condition is `x >= 0 && x <= z`.\n\nThe ranking function is `(z - x, -x)`. This is a lexicographic ranking function, where `z - x` decreases or remains the same in every iteration, and if `z - x` remains the same, `-x` decreases.\n\nWe can now list the loop invariants:\n\n- Before the loop execution, the ranking function `(z - x, -x)` is non-negative as `x` is non-negative and `x <= z`.\n- In every iteration, `x` is non-negative and `x <= z`, therefore `(z - x, -x)` is non-negative.\n- In every iteration, `x` increases and `z` remains the same, therefore `z - x` decreases or remains the same.\n- If `z - x` remains the same, `x` increases and `-x` decreases.\n- After the loop termination, `x` is negative or `x > z`, therefore the loop invariant `x >= 0 && x <= z` is false.\n\nHere are the loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant \\at(x, LoopEntry) >= 0 && \\at(x, LoopEntry) <= \\at(z, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant x >= 0 && x <= z;\n    loop invariant z - x <= \\at(z - x, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant x > \\at(x, LoopEntry) ==> -x < -\\at(x, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant x < 0 || x > z;\n*/\n```",

This means that both x and z are non-negative at the loop head.\n\nAlso, in each iteration of the loop, the value of x is doubled and y is incremented by 1.\n\nThe given lexicographic ranking function is (z - x, -x). This means that z - x decreases in each iteration, or if it stays the same, -x decreases.\n\nNow, we can derive the loop invariants that support this ranking function:\n\n- Before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop, z - x is non-negative. This is because x is always less than or equal to z. \n- The value of x at the loop entry is less than or equal to the value of z, and the value of x at the end of each iteration is greater than the value of x at the loop entry. This supports the fact that z - x decreases with every iteration.\n- The value of x at the loop entry is less than or equal to the value of x at the end of each iteration. This supports the fact that -x decreases when z - x remains the same.\n- After the loop termination, x is greater than z. This is because the loop condition x <= z is no longer true.\n\nThe loop invariants are:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant \\at(x, LoopEntry) <= z;\n    loop invariant \\at(x, LoopEntry) <= x;\n    loop invariant z - x >= 0;\n    loop invariant x > z ==> \\at(x, LoopEntry) < x;\n*/\n```",

After the loop body, x becomes 2*x + y and y becomes y + 1. So, x is increasing and y is increasing.\n\n- After the loop termination, x must be less than 0 or greater than z.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can say that:\n\n(i) x is always non-negative in the loop because it starts as non-negative and increases in each iteration.\n\n(ii) y is always increasing in the loop.\n\n(iii) x is always less than or equal to z in the loop.\n\n(iv) The value of x at the end of each iteration is greater than or equal to its value at the beginning.\n\nLet's write these invariants in ACSL:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= x;\n    loop invariant y <= \\at(y, LoopEntry) + 1;\n    loop invariant x <= z;\n    loop invariant \\at(x, LoopEntry) <= x;\n*/\n```\n\nThese invariants support the loop variant (z - x, -x), because they guarantee that z - x and -x are decreasing in every iteration of the loop, which means the loop will eventually terminate."
