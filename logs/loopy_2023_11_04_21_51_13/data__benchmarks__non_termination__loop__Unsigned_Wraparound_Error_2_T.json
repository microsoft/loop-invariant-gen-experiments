Analyze the loop body:\n   - The loop body only contains the statement `ui *= 2`, which doubles the value of `ui` in each iteration.\n\n3. Finding a ranking function:\n   - We know that `ui` is always less than `size` and `ui` doubles in each iteration, so the loop will terminate when `ui >= size`.\n   - A valid ranking function can be the difference between `size` and `ui`, as it will be positive and decreasing with each iteration.\n\nSo, the ranking function can be expressed as:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant size - ui;\n*/\n```",
