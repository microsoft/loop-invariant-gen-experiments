However, the value of `c` is bounded by the changes in the variable `x`. \n\nIf `x > 100`, `c` is decremented and `x` is decreased by `10` in each iteration, until `x` is no longer `> 100`. \nIf `x â‰¤ 100`, `c` is incremented and `x` is increased by `11` in each iteration, until `x` becomes `> 100`. \n\nThis means that `c` will eventually reach `0`, causing the loop to terminate. \n\nTo prove this, we can use `x` as a ranking function. \n\nThe ranking function is `x` and it is valid because `x` is always positive and decreasing when `x > 100` and increasing otherwise, but always bounded by `100`. This ensures that the loop will eventually terminate. \n\nThe ranking function for the loop in this program is `x`.\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n*/\n```",
            "The variable `c` is the loop control variable here. It is initialized to 1 and it controls the execution of the loop (when `c` is no longer positive, the loop terminates).\n\nIn every iteration, `c` either increases by 1 or decreases by 1 based on the value of `x`. However, we can't directly use `c` as the ranking function because it is not strictly decreasing. It might increase in some iterations. We need to find a function that strictly decreases with every iteration.\n\nIn each iteration of the loop, `c` decreases when `x` is greater than 100, and increases when `x` is less or equal to 100. Since `x` decreases by 10 when `x > 100`, and increases by 11 when `x <= 100`, `x` will eventually be less than or equal to 100. When `x` is less or equal to 100, `c` will increase and when `c` increases, the loop will eventually terminate. \n\nTherefore, we can use `c - x` as the ranking function, which is always decreasing (as `x` increases or `c` decreases) and is positive as long as the loop continues (since `c` is positive and `x` is non-negative).\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant c - x;\n*/\n``` \n\nThis function is valid because:\n1. It decreases in each iteration of the loop. When `x > 100`, `x` decreases and `c` also decreases. When `x <= 100`, `x` increases but `c` increases more (`x` increases by 11 and `c` increases by 1), so the overall value of `c - x` decreases.\n2. It's positive as long as the loop continues. `c` is always positive during the loop, and `x` is non-negative (it starts from an unknown value but it's always either decreased or increased by a positive number), so `c - x` is positive.\n3. It will eventually reach 0, leading to loop termination. When `x` becomes less than or equal to 100, `c` will continue increasing until it's no longer positive, which will make `c - x` reach 0 and the loop will terminate.",
            "The variables live at the loop head are `x` and `c`. The loop condition is `c > 0`, so the loop continues to execute as long as `c` is positive. \n\nIn each iteration, depending on the value of `x`, `c` either increases by 1 or decreases by 1, and `x` either increases by 11 or decreases by 10. \n\nWe need to find a ranking function that is guaranteed to decrease with every successive iteration of the loop. \n\nGiven the nature of the operations, it seems that the ranking function should be something related to `c` and `x`. Notice that `x` increases or decreases in multiples of 10 or 11, and the value of `c` changes by 1 in each iteration. \n\nAfter analyzing the program, we can see that the value of `c` is always less than or equal to `x/10` at the start of the loop. This is because for every increase by 11 in `x`, `c` increases by 1, and for every decrease by 10 in `x`, `c` decreases by 1. \n\nTherefore, a possible ranking function is `x - 10*c`, which will decrease with every iteration of the loop. Here is how we can express this ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```c\n/*@\n    loop invariant x >= 10*c;\n    loop variant x - 10*c;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because it meets the requirements: it is positive as long as the loop is executing (since `x >= 10*c`), and it decreases with every iteration of the loop (since `c` increases or decreases by 1 in each iteration, but `x` increases or decreases by more than 10).",

Inside the loop, `c` decreases by 1 when `x` is greater than 100 and increases by 1 when `x` is less or equal to 100. This means that `c` is not strictly decreasing with every iteration of the loop, and therefore, is not a suitable ranking function.\n\nHowever, the variable `x` decreases by 10 when it is greater than 100 and increases by 11 when it is less or equal to 100. This means that `x` is not strictly decreasing with every iteration of the loop, and therefore, is not a suitable ranking function.\n\nSince neither `c` nor `x` alone is a suitable ranking function, we need to find a ranking function involving both `c` and `x`.\n\nWe can see that the value of `c` is always increasing by 1 when `x` is less or equal to 100 and decreasing by 1 when `x` is greater than 100. Therefore, the value of `c` is always less than or equal to the value of `x`. \n\nMoreover, the value of `x` is always greater than or equal to 100 and less than or equal to 200. Therefore, the value of `x` is always greater than or equal to the value of `c`.\n\nBased on these observations, we can use the expression `x - c` as a ranking function. This expression is always positive when the loop is executing, and it decreases with every iteration of the loop. Therefore, it is a valid ranking function.\n\nHere is the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x - c;\n*/\n``` \n\nThis ranking function is valid because it decreases with every iteration of the loop and is positive while the loop is executing. These are the two necessary conditions for a ranking function. \n\nThe expression `x - c` decreases with every iteration because `x` decreases by 10 and `c` decreases by 1 when `x` is greater than 100, and `x` increases by 11 and `c` increases by 1 when `x` is less or equal to 100. Therefore, the difference `x - c` always decreases by at least 1 with every iteration.\n\nThe expression `x - c` is always positive while the loop is executing because `x` is always greater than or equal to `c`. This ensures that the loop terminates.",
            "At the beginning of the loop, `c` is 1.

So, we need to find a different ranking function that decreases with every iteration of the loop.\n\nThe ranking function can be `c + (100 - x)` because it decreases in every iteration. When `x > 100`, `c` decreases by 1 and `x` decreases by 10. The value of `c + (100 - x)` decreases by 11. When `x <= 100`, `c` increases by 1 and `x` increases by 11. The value of `c + (100 - x)` decreases by 10.\n\nSo, we can write the ranking function in ACSL syntax as:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant c + (100 - x);\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because it satisfies the requirements:\n- it decreases in every iteration of the loop\n- its value is positive while the loop is executing."

The net effect is that the loop variant remains the same or decreases.\n- If `x <= 100`, `x` increases by `11` and `c` increases by `1`. The increase in `x` decreases the loop variant and the increase in `c` increases the loop variant. The net effect is that the loop variant increases.\n- However, the loop condition guarantees that `c > 0`. So, the loop variant cannot increase indefinitely. Therefore, the loop variant decreases eventually.\n\n(iii) After the loop termination:\n- The loop terminates when `c <= 0`.

The loop continues as long as `c` is greater than `0`. Inside the loop, `x` and `c` are updated depending on the value of `x`:\n\n- If `x` is greater than `100`, then `x` is decreased by `10` and `c` is decreased by `1`.\n- Otherwise, `x` is increased by `11` and `c` is increased by `1`.\n\nThe ranking function is `(c, 101 - x)`. This is a lexicographic ranking function, where `c` is the first expression and `101 - x` is the second. \n\nNow, let's derive the loop invariants.\n\n1.

After the loop termination, `c` is `0`.\n\nHere are the corresponding loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 1 <= c;\n    loop invariant x > 100 ==> \\at(c, LoopEntry) > c;\n    loop invariant x > 100 ==> \\at(x, LoopEntry) - 10 == x;\n    loop invariant x <= 100 ==> \\at(c, LoopEntry) < c;\n    loop invariant x <= 100 ==> \\at(x, LoopEntry) + 11 == x;\n    loop invariant 0 <= x;\n    loop invariant c <= x / 11 + 1;\n*/\n```",

This means that the first component of the variant decreases. \n\nIf `x <= 100`, then `x` is increased by `11` and `c` is increased by `1`. This means that the first component of the variant remains the same and the second component decreases.\n\nThe loop invariants that can be deduced from the above analysis are:\n1. `c >= 0`: This is true before the loop because `c` is initialized to `1`. It is true in every iteration because `c` is only decreased if it is positive, and it is only increased if `x <= 100`. It is true after the loop because the loop condition is `c > 0`.\n2. `x <= 111`: This is true before the loop because `x` is assigned `unknown_int()`, which can return any integer. It is true in every iteration because `x` is only increased if `x <= 100`, and it is decreased otherwise. It is true after the loop because `x` is not modified after the loop.\n3. `c ==> (101 - x >= 0)`: This is true before the loop because `c` is `1` and `101 - x` is non-negative for any `x <= 111`. It is true in every iteration because if `c` is positive, then either `x` is decreased or `101 - x` is increased. It is true after the loop because `c` is not positive when the loop terminates.\n\nHere are the loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant c >= 0;\n    loop invariant x <= 111;\n    loop invariant c ==> (101 - x >= 0);\n*/\n```",
                    "- The program starts with an unknown integer value for `x` and `c` is set to `1`.\n- In the loop, if `x` is greater than `100`, it is decreased by `10` and `c` is decreased by `1`. Otherwise, `x` is increased by `11` and `c` is increased by `1`.\n- The loop continues until `c` is not greater than `0`.\n- The lexicographic ranking function provided is `(c, 101 - x)`. The first component `c` decreases if `x` is greater than `100` and increases otherwise. The second component `101 - x` increases if `x` is greater than `100` and decreases otherwise. This supports the termination of the loop as at least one of the components is decreasing in each iteration of the loop.\n\nBased on these observations, here are the loop invariants:\n\n```c\n/*@ \n    loop invariant c >= 0;\n    loop invariant x <= 101;\n    loop invariant x >= -10;\n    loop invariant \\at(c, LoopEntry) <= c + 1;\n    loop invariant \\at(c, LoopEntry) >= c - 1;\n    loop invariant \\at(x, LoopEntry) <= x + 10;\n    loop invariant \\at(x, LoopEntry) >= x - 11;\n*/\n```\n\nThese loop invariants indicate that `c` and `x` are within certain bounds, and that their values can only change by a certain amount in each iteration of the loop. This supports the ranking function `(c, 101 - x)` and proves the termination of the loop."

The program then enters a while loop that continues as long as `c` is greater than 0. In each iteration of the loop, the program checks if `x` is greater than 100. If it is, `x` is decreased by 10 and `c` is decreased by 1. If `x` is not greater than 100, `x` is increased by 11 and `c` is increased by 1.\n\nThe given loop variant is `(c, x > 100 ? x : 0)`. This means that the first element of the loop variant is `c`, and the second element is `x` if `x` is greater than 100, otherwise it's 0. This suggests that `c` should decrease in every iteration of the loop, and `x` should decrease in every iteration where `x` is greater than 100.\n\nNow let's find the loop invariants.\n\n1.

This is because `c` is initialized as `1` and only decreases by `1` when `x > 100`, and increases by `1` when `x <= 100`.\n- `x >= 0 ==> c <= x + 1`: This is true before the loop starts, remains true throughout the loop, and is still true after the loop finishes. This is because, when `x >= 0`, `c` is always less than or equal to `x + 1`.\n- `x < 0 ==> c >= -x`: This is true before the loop starts, remains true throughout the loop, and is still true after the loop finishes. This is because, when `x < 0`, `c` is always greater than or equal to `-x`.\n- `\\at(c, LoopEntry) > c || (\\at(c, LoopEntry) == c && \\at(x, LoopEntry) > x)`: This is the loop variant. It is ensured by the loop body that either `c` decreases or, if `c` remains the same, `x` decreases.",
                    "First, let's note down the variables that are live at the loop head: **c** and **x**. \n\nThe loop condition is **c > 0**. \n\nThe given ranking function is **(c, x > 100 ? x - 100 : 100 - x)**.\n\nThis is a lexicographic ranking function where the first expression is **c** and the second expression is **x > 100 ? x - 100 : 100 - x**.\n\nLet's find loop invariants that hold (i) before the loop execution, (ii) in every iteration of the loop and (iii) after the loop termination, such that the loop invariants imply that the ranking function decreases with every iteration.\n\nThe following invariants can be noted:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant c >= 0;\n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant c == 1 || x > 100;\n    loop invariant x <= 100 ==> \\at(c, LoopEntry) < c;\n    loop invariant x > 100 ==> \\at(c, LoopEntry) > c && \\at(x, LoopEntry) > x;\n*/\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- **c >= 0**: This invariant holds because c is initially 1 and it only decreases when x > 100 and increases otherwise.\n- **x >= 0**: This invariant holds because x is non-negative and it only increases or decreases by 10 or 11.\n- **c == 1 || x > 100**: This invariant indicates that the value of c is 1 or x is greater than 100. This holds because c can only decrease when x > 100 and it increases when x <= 100.\n- **x <= 100 ==> \\at(c, LoopEntry) < c**: This invariant states that if x is less than or equal to 100, then the value of c at the beginning of the loop is less than the current value of c. This holds because when x <= 100, c increases.\n- **x > 100 ==> \\at(c, LoopEntry) > c && \\at(x, LoopEntry) > x**: This invariant states that if x is greater than 100, then the value of c at the beginning of the loop is greater than the current value of c and the value of x at the beginning of the loop is greater than the current value of x.

The second expression `x <= 100 ? 100 - x : 0` decreases once the first expression `c` becomes non-positive. When `x > 100`, the value of this expression is 0 (which doesn't affect the termination).

Once the first expression becomes non-positive (i.e., `c <= 0`), the second expression `110 - x` comes into play. In this case, since `c <= 0`, the loop will only execute the else block, where `x` increases by 11. The second expression decreases as `x` increases, and since `x` is bound by the condition `x > 100`, the loop will eventually terminate when `110 - x` becomes non-positive.\n\nPutting it all together, we have the following multi-phase ranking function:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant c;\n    loop variant 110 - x;\n*/\n```",

We can choose `x-100` as the second expression, as it decreases when `x > 100`.\n\nPutting these expressions together, we get the multi-phase ranking function:\n\n```c\n/*@\n    loop variant c;\n    loop variant x-100;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because it follows the rules specified for multi-phase ranking functions. The first expression (`c`) decreases with successive iterations of the loop until it becomes non-positive. When this happens, the second expression (`x-100`) decreases with successive iterations of the loop until the loop terminates."

                    "First, let's note that the loop condition is `c > 0`, which means that the loop will terminate when `c` is no longer greater than `0`.\n\nThe loop variant is `(c, x-100)`. This is a lexicographic ranking function because it's a sequence of two expressions. According to the rules of a lexicographic ranking function, the first expression `c` should decrease, or if it remains the same, the second expression `x-100` should decrease.\n\nBefore the loop execution, we know that `c = 1` and `x` is an unknown integer. This gives us the first loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant 1 <= c; */\n```\n\nIn every iteration of the loop, if `x > 100`, then `x` is decreased by `10` and `c` is decreased by `1`. If `x <= 100`, then `x` is increased by `11` and `c` is increased by `1`. So, we can state that `x` will always be at least `0` and `c` will always be greater than `0`. This gives us the second loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant x >= 0; */\n```\n\nAfter the loop termination, `c` will be `0`. As for `x`, it will be whatever value it was at the last iteration of the loop. Given the loop body, `x` will always be less than or equal to `100` at the loop termination. This gives us the third loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant x <= 100; */\n```\n\nWe can now add the loop invariants that are derived from the lexicographic ranking function. Since `c` is always decreasing, and `x` is decreasing when `x > 100`, we can add the following loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant \\at(c, LoopEntry) >= c; */\n/*@ loop invariant \\at(x, LoopEntry) >= x ==> c == \\at(c, LoopEntry); */\n```\n\nThe above loop invariants support the loop variant `(c, x-100)` and prove the termination of the loop. Here are all the loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 1 <= c;\n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant x <= 100;\n    loop invariant \\at(c, LoopEntry) >= c;\n    loop invariant \\at(x, LoopEntry) >= x ==> c == \\at(c, LoopEntry);\n*/\n```",
                    "- The program variables that are live at the loop head are `x` and `c`.\n- The loop condition is `c > 0`.\n- The ranking function is `(c, x-100)`.\n- The loop invariant for `c` should be that it is always non-negative, as it starts from 1 and either increases or decreases by 1.\n- The loop invariant for `x` should be that it is always less than or equal to the value of `x` at the loop entry plus 11, as it either increases by 11 or decreases by 10.\n\nLet's write down the loop invariants.\n\n```c\n/*@ \n    loop invariant c >= 0;\n    loop invariant x <= \\at(x, LoopEntry) + 11;\n*/\n```\n\n- Since `x` and `c` are updated differently depending on the value of `x`, we need to add loop invariants that handle these cases.\n  - If `x > 100`, `x` decreases by 10 and `c` decreases by 1. This means that `x > 100` implies `x` decreases and `c` decreases.\n  - If `x <= 100`, `x` increases by 11 and `c` increases by 1. This means that `x <= 100` implies `x` increases and `c` increases.\n\nLet's add these loop invariants.\n\n```c\n/*@ \n    loop invariant c >= 0;\n    loop invariant x <= \\at(x, LoopEntry) + 11;\n    loop invariant x > 100 ==> x <= \\at(x, LoopEntry) && c <= \\at(c, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant x <= 100 ==> x >= \\at(x, LoopEntry) && c >= \\at(c, LoopEntry);\n*/\n```\n\n- Finally, we need to add a loop invariant that ensures the ranking function `(c, x-100)` decreases lexicographically. \n  - If `c` remains the same, `x-100` must decrease. \n  - If `c` decreases, `x-100` can remain the same or decrease.\n\nLet's add this loop invariant.\n\n```c\n/*@ \n    loop invariant c >= 0;\n    loop invariant x <= \\at(x, LoopEntry) + 11;\n    loop invariant x > 100 ==> x <= \\at(x, LoopEntry) && c <= \\at(c, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant x <= 100 ==> x >= \\at(x, LoopEntry) && c >= \\at(c, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant c == \\at(c, LoopEntry) ==> x-100 < \\at(x-100, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant c < \\at(c, LoopEntry) ==> x-100 <= \\at(x-100, LoopEntry);\n*/\n```",
                    "The program initializes variables x and c, where x can be any integer, and c is set to 1. Then, it enters a loop that continues as long as c is greater than 0.

Otherwise, x is increased by 11 and c is increased by 1.\n\nThe lexicographic ranking function provided is (c, x-100). It states that either c decreases or c remains the same and x-100 decreases.\n\nThe loop invariants we can derive from this are:\n\n- c is always greater than or equal to 0. This is because c starts as 1 and only decreases when x > 100, and it increases when x <= 100.\n- x is always less than or equal to 111.
