Let's define `v` as our ranking function:\n\n```\nv = x - 100\n```\n\nNow let's check if this function satisfies the conditions of a ranking function:\n\n1. The value of `v` must be positive while the loop is executing. The loop executes while `x >= 0`, so as long as `x >= 100`, `v` will be positive.\n\n2. The value of `v` must decrease with every iteration. In every iteration, `x` is updated as `x - y`. Since `y` starts at 100 and decreases by `z` in each iteration, the value of `x` will decrease by at least 100 in each iteration, making `v` decrease as well.\n\nSo, our ranking function is `v = x - 100`, and we can represent it in ACSL syntax as:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x - 100;\n*/\n```",

So, the value of `(y+1) - z` always decreases.\n- It is positive for the loop to continue executing: As long as x is non-negative, the loop continues to execute.

This means that the loop will continue as long as `x` is greater than or equal to 0. \n\nIn each iteration of the loop, `x` is reduced by `y` which is initially 100 and then reduced by `z` which is initially 1 and then made negative in each iteration. This means that `x` will decrease in each iteration of the loop. Therefore, `x` can be the first expression in the lexicographic ranking function.\n\nSecondly, `y` starts from 100 and is reduced by `z` in each iteration. Even though `z` changes its sign in each iteration, `y` is always reduced by the absolute value of `z`. Therefore, `y` is always positive and decreases in each iteration, so it can be the second expression in the ranking function.\n\nFinally, `z` is initially positive and then its sign is changed in each iteration. This means that `z` doesn't strictly decrease or increase. However, the absolute value of `z` is always 1, so it remains constant throughout the loop. Thus, `abs(z)` can be the third expression in the ranking function.\n\nIn summary, the lexicographic ranking function for this loop is `(x, y, abs(z))`. This is a valid ranking function because `x` and `y` are always positive and decrease in each iteration, and `abs(z)` remains constant and positive. Therefore, this ranking function guarantees that the loop will eventually terminate.\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n    loop variant y;\n    loop variant z >= 0 ? z : -z;\n*/\n```",

So, the loop will terminate when `x` is less than `0`. \n\nLooking at the body of the loop, `x` is decreased by `y`, `y` is decreased by `z`, and `z` is negated with each iteration. \n\nHence, `x` is always decreasing with each loop iteration as long as `y` is positive. Since `y` starts with `100` and decreases by `z` (which is `1` or `-1`), `y` remains positive until it becomes `0`. \n\nSo, `x` and `y` can be the first two expressions of our lexicographic ranking function. \n\nThe third expression is a bit more tricky. The variable `z` oscillates between `1` and `-1`. It does not continuously decrease or increase. However, we know that `z` is `1` at the start of the loop and after each two iterations, `z` will be `1` again. Hence, the absolute value of `z`, which can be represented as `(z < 0 ? -z : z)`, is `1` at the start of the loop and becomes `1` every two iterations. This expression can serve as our third ranking function.\n\nSo, the lexicographic ranking function for this loop is `(x, y, (z < 0 ? -z : z))`.\n\nThis is a valid ranking function because:\n- `x` is always positive and decreases in each iteration (as long as `y` is positive)\n- When `x` remains the same, `y` is positive and decreases\n- When `x` and `y` remain the same, `(z < 0 ? -z : z)` is positive and becomes `1` every two iterations.\n\nThe lexicographic ranking function in ACSL syntax is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n    loop variant y;\n    loop variant (z < 0 ? -z : z);\n*/\n```",

However, we need to make sure that all expressions are positive for the loop to execute.\n\n`x` is always positive for the loop to execute. Therefore, we can use `x` as the first expression in our ranking function.\n\n`y` starts from 100 and decreases by `z` in each iteration. `z` gets negated in each iteration, which means `y` changes its direction of change in every other iteration. But overall, `y` decreases. Also, `y` is always positive for the loop to execute because the maximum value `y` can have is 100. Therefore, we can use `y` as the second expression in our ranking function.\n\n`z` gets negated in each iteration. So, its absolute value remains the same. However, to make it positive, we can use the expression `1-z` as the third expression in our ranking function, which will always be positive and remain the same. \n\nTherefore, the lexicographic ranking function for the given loop is `(x, y, 1-z)`.

This invariant is violated when the loop terminates, which is when x becomes negative. Therefore, we have the loop invariant `\\at(x, LoopEntry) >= 0`.\n- `y >= 0` holds true before the loop and is a loop invariant as long as the loop continues.

This invariant is violated when the loop terminates, which is when z becomes something other than 1 or -1. However, in this program, z can only toggle between 1 and -1, so this invariant is always true. Therefore, we have the loop invariant `\\at(z, LoopEntry) == 1 || \\at(z, LoopEntry) == -1`.\n\nThus, we can write:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant \\at(x, LoopEntry) >= 0;\n    loop invariant \\at(y, LoopEntry) >= 0;\n    loop invariant \\at(z, LoopEntry) == 1 || \\at(z, LoopEntry) == -1;\n*/\n```\n\nThe above loop invariants support the loop variant `(x, y, z >= 0 ? z : -z)`, as they ensure that the value of the ranking function decreases with every iteration. The fact that `x >= 0` and `y >= 0` ensures that the first two components of the ranking function decrease with each iteration.
