Starting values or constraints:\n   - `st_max > it_min`\n   - `best > 0`\n3. Loop body:\n   - `pre` is assigned the value of `cur`\n   - `cur` is incremented by `best`\n   - The loop breaks if `st_max < cur` or `cur <= pre`\n\nNow, let's find a ranking function for this loop. We need to find an expression that decreases with every iteration and is positive while the loop is executing.\n\nSince `cur` is incremented by `best` in every iteration and `best > 0`, we can use the difference between `st_max` and `cur` as the ranking function. As long as the loop is executing, `st_max >= cur`, so this difference is positive.\n\nThe ranking function is: `st_max - cur`\n\nNow, let's write the ranking function using ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant st_max - cur;\n*/\n```",
            "First, let's identify the variables live at the loop head and their constraints:\n- `best`: positive value (due to the condition `if( best == 0 ) return 0;`)\n- `cur`: starts with the value of `best`\n- `pre`: will be assigned the old value of `cur` in each iteration\n- `st_max`: any unsigned int value\n- `it_min`: any unsigned int value\n- `st_max > it_min` (due to the condition `if( st_max <= it_min ) return 0;`)\n\nNow let's analyze the loop body and find a ranking function:\n- The loop continues to execute as long as `st_max >= cur`\n- In each iteration, `cur` is increased by `best`, and `pre` is assigned the old value of `cur`\n- The loop terminates if `cur <= pre` (i.e., when `cur` wraps around due to unsigned integer overflow)\n\nSince `cur` is increasing in each iteration and has an upper bound of `st_max`, we can consider the expression `st_max - cur` as our ranking function. This expression will decrease with each iteration and will remain positive as long as the loop is executing.\n\nSo, the ranking function is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant st_max - cur;\n*/\n```",
            "First, let's make note of the starting values or constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head:\n\n1. `best` is an unsigned integer and it is not equal to 0\n2. `cur` is initialized to `best`, so it is also an unsigned integer and not equal to 0\n3. `st_max` and `it_min` are unsigned integers, and `st_max > it_min`\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body and find a ranking function involving the variables in the loop body:\n\n1. The loop continues as long as `st_max >= cur`\n2. In each iteration, `pre` is assigned the value of `cur`, and `cur` is incremented by `best`\n3. The loop breaks if `cur <= pre`\n\nWe can observe that `cur` increases monotonically by `best` in each iteration, and the loop terminates when `st_max < cur` or `cur <= pre`. Since `cur` increases by `best`, which is a positive value, it will eventually become greater than `st_max`. Also, as unsigned integers have an upper bound (UINT_MAX), `cur` will eventually reach this bound and break the loop if `cur <= pre`.\n\nNow let's construct the ranking function using these observations. The ranking function should involve the upper bound of the loop variable and the old value of the loop variable in every iteration. In this case, we can use `UINT_MAX - cur` as the ranking function:\n\n```c\n/*@\n    loop variant UINT_MAX - cur;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because:\n\n1. It is decreasing with every iteration of the loop, as `cur` increases by `best` in each iteration, and `best` is positive.\n2. It evaluates to a positive value while the loop is executing, as `cur` is always less than or equal to `st_max`, which is less than `UINT_MAX`.\n3. When `cur` reaches its upper bound (`UINT_MAX`), the loop will break due to the condition `cur <= pre`.",

In the loop body:\n   - `cur` is increased by `best` in each iteration.\n   - The loop continues as long as `st_max >= cur` and `cur > pre`.\n\nNow, let's find a ranking function. The loop termination relies on the value of `cur` and the relationship between `cur` and `st_max`. We can use the difference between `st_max` and `cur` as our ranking function, as it decreases with each iteration and is positive as long as the loop continues.\n\nThe ranking function is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant st_max - cur;\n*/\n```",

Since `cur` is incremented by `best` in every iteration, we can use the difference between the upper bound `st_max` and the current value of `cur` as the ranking function.\n\nSo, the ranking function is `st_max - cur`.\n\nNow, let's check if it is a valid ranking function:\n1.
