            "First, we need to make note of the starting values or constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head. In this case, the variables are `life` and `death`. The starting values are:\n\n```\nlife = 13;\ndeath = 17;\n```\n\nNext, let's analyze the loop body and find a ranking function involving the variables in the loop body:\n\n```\nwhile (life < death) {\n    temp = death;\n    death = life + 1;\n    life = temp;\n    \n    if (choose < life || choose < death) {\n        life = choose;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn each iteration of the loop, the value of `life` and `death` are swapped, and `death` is incremented by 1. If either `life` or `death` is greater than `choose`, `life` is set to the value of `choose`.\n\nNow let's find the ranking function for this loop. Since the loop condition is `life < death`, we can use the expression `death - life` as our ranking function. This is because the value of `death - life` will always be positive while the loop is executing, and it will decrease with each iteration as `death` is updated to be `life + 1` and `life` is updated to be the old value of `death`.\n\nThus, the ranking function is `death - life`. In ACSL syntax, the code block for the ranking function is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant death - life;\n*/\n```",
            "1. Starting values or constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head:\n   - `choose = 2`\n   - `life = 13`\n   - `death = 17`\n\n2.

Find a ranking function involving the variables in the loop body:\n   - We can observe that `death - life` decreases in every iteration.\n   - The loop condition `life < death` ensures that `death - life > 0` for the loop to continue executing.\n\n4. The ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant death - life;\n*/\n```",
            "First, let's note the starting values and constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head:\n- choose = 2\n- life = 13\n- death = 17\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body:\n1. temp is assigned the value of death.\n2. death is assigned the value of life + 1.\n3. life is assigned the value of temp.\n4. If choose is less than life or choose is less than death, life is assigned the value of choose.\n\nTo find a ranking function, we need to find an expression that decreases with every iteration of the loop and is positive as long as the loop continues executing. From the loop body, we can see that the values of life and death are being swapped in each iteration, and death is increased by 1. We can use the absolute difference between life and death as the ranking function:\n\n`abs(life - death)`\n\nNow let's check if it is a valid ranking function:\n1. Decreasing with every iteration: In each iteration, the difference between life and death decreases by 1, so the absolute value of the difference also decreases.\n2. Positive value while the loop is executing: Since life is always less than death while the loop is running (life < death), the absolute value of the difference between life and death will always be positive.\n\nNow, we can output the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant abs(life - death);\n*/\n```",
            "1. The variables that are live at the loop head are `life` and `death`.\n\n2. The loop body swaps the values of `life` and `death` and increments `life` by 1.

The ranking function should involve `life` and `death`, and we need to find an expression that decreases with every successive iteration of the loop.\n\nThe ranking function we can use is `death - life`. Let's analyze why this is a valid ranking function:\n\n- At the beginning of the loop, `death` is greater than `life`, so `death - life` is positive.\n\n- During every iteration, the value of `death` is replaced by the value of `life + 1`. Since `life < death`, we can say that `death - (life + 1) < death - life`.\n\n- If `choose` is less than both `life` and `death`, then `life` is updated to the value of `choose`. In this case, the value of `death - life` will still be smaller than the previous iteration.\n\nBased on the above observations, we can conclude that `death - life` is a valid ranking function for the given loop.\n\nHere's the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant death - life;\n*/\n```",

Observe that in every iteration, the values of `life` and `death` are swapped and `death` is incremented by 1. If `choose` is less than either `life` or `death`, then `life` is set to the value of `choose`. This ensures that the loop terminates since the value of `life` is guaranteed to increase in every iteration.\n\nA suitable ranking function would be the difference between `death` and `life`. Since `death` is always greater than `life` during the loop execution, the ranking function will be positive. Furthermore, the difference between `death` and `life` decreases with every iteration.\n\nHere's the ranking function:\n\n```c\n/*@\n    loop variant death - life;\n*/\n```"

This can be extended to as many expressions as needed.\nFind the lexicographic ranking function for the loop in the following program and explain why it is a valid ranking function.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make note of the starting values or constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head.\n- Analyze the loop body and find a ranking function such that:\n    - The first expression in the ranking function is positive and decreases.\n    - If the first expression remains the same, the second expression is positive and decreases.\n    - If the first and second expressions remain the same, the third expression is positive and decreases and so on.\n- Output the ranking function in one code block, in ACSL syntax, in their lexicographic order. For example, if the ranking function is (v1, v2), output it as:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant v1;\n    loop variant v2;\n*/\n```\n\nRules:\n- **Do not use constants or functions not defined in the program.

In each iteration, the loop body does the following:\n\n1. Swaps the values of life and death (with the help of temp variable).\n2. Increases the new value of life by 1 (i.e., the old value of death).\n3. If choose is less than the new values of life or death, life is set to choose.\n\nLet's define a lexicographic ranking function (v1, v2) for this loop:\n\n- v1: The difference between death and life. This is positive initially (17 - 13) and decreases in each iteration, as life is always increased by 1 and death is replaced by the old value of life.\n- v2: The absolute value of the difference between choose and life. This is positive initially (|2 - 13|) and decreases in each iteration, as life may be set to choose in the if statement when choose is less than life or death.\n\nUsing this lexicographic ranking function, we can prove that the loop terminates, as v1 is always decreasing, and if v1 remains constant, v2 is decreasing. Here is the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant death - life;\n    loop variant (choose - life >= 0) ? (choose - life) : (life - choose);\n*/\n```",

The loop condition is `life < death`. This means that `death - life` is positive for the loop to execute.\n2. In the loop body, the values of `life` and `death` are swapped, and `death` is incremented by 1.\n3. If `choose < life` or `choose < death`, then `life` is assigned the value of `choose`.\n\nLet's construct the lexicographic ranking function:\n1. The first expression should be positive and decrease. We can use `death - life` as the first expression, as it is positive while the loop is executing and decreases in each iteration.\n2. The second expression should be positive and decrease when the first expression remains the same. In this case, the first expression remains the same only if `choose < life` or `choose < death`.

The first expression should involve `death` since it is updated in the loop, and `life` is less than `death`. A suitable expression is `(death - life)`.\n\n2. If the first expression remains the same, we need to find a second expression that is positive and decreases. In this case, the second expression should involve `choose` since it is used to update `life`.

We also have the `choose` variable, but it remains constant throughout the loop, so it doesn't affect the ranking function.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body and find a ranking function. The loop continues to execute while `life < death`. In each iteration of the loop, `temp` is assigned the value of `death`, and `death` is assigned `life + 1`. Then, `life` is assigned the value of `temp`.

The first expression, `(death - life)`, decreases with successive iterations of the loop, because `death` is assigned `life + 1` and `life` is assigned the value of `temp` (which is the previous value of `death`). This means that the difference between `death` and `life` gets smaller with each iteration.\n\n2. When the first expression becomes non-positive (i.e., `death <= life`), the loop condition `life < death` is no longer satisfied, and the loop terminates. However, if the loop continues, it means that the first expression is still positive and the second expression, `(choose - life)`, starts to decrease with successive iterations of the loop. This happens because, if `choose < life || choose < death`, `life` is assigned the value of `choose`, thus reducing the difference between `choose` and `life`.\n\n3. Finally, when the second expression becomes non-positive (i.e., `choose <= life`), it means that `life` has reached its smallest possible value, and the loop is guaranteed to terminate.\n\nThus, the given multi-phase ranking function is valid, as it ensures termination of the loop.",

During each iteration, the value of `death` is decreased and the value of `life` is increased, so `death - life` keeps decreasing. Once `death - life` becomes non-positive, the loop terminates.\n\nSecond expression: Not needed, since we have already found a ranking function that decreases until the loop terminates.\n\nThe multi-phase ranking function for this loop is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant death - life;\n*/\n```",

The second expression should decrease once the first expression becomes non-positive:\nWhen `life >= death`, the loop will terminate. However, there's a condition inside the loop that updates the value of `life` to `choose` if `choose < life || choose < death`. So, we need to consider this condition in our ranking function. We can use the absolute value of the difference between `choose` and `life`, which is `(choose < life) ? life - choose : choose - life`, as the second expression in the ranking function.\n\nSo, the multi-phase ranking function for the given program is:\n\n```c\n/*@\n    loop variant death - life;\n    loop variant (choose < life) ? life - choose : choose - life;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because:\n- The first expression (`death - life`) decreases with successive iterations of the loop until it becomes non-positive.\n- The second expression (`(choose < life) ? life - choose : choose - life`) decreases once the first expression becomes non-positive and continues to decrease until the loop terminates.",
            "1. Make note of the starting values or constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head.\n\nAt the loop head, we have the following variables and their values:\n- choose = 2\n- life = 13\n- death = 17\n\n2. Analyze the loop body and find a ranking function such that the first expression decreases in the first iteration of the loop and continues to decrease, the second expression decreases once the first expression becomes zero or negative, and so on.\n\nThe loop continues as long as `life < death`. Inside the loop, we have:\n- temp = death\n- death = life + 1\n- life = temp\n\nThen, we have an if condition where if `choose < life || choose < death`, life is assigned the value of choose.\n\nNow let's find the ranking functions.\n\nFirst Expression:\nThe difference between `death` and `life` decreases as we swap their values in each iteration. Therefore, we can use `death - life` as the first expression.\n\nSecond Expression:\nOnce the first expression becomes non-positive, we can use the difference between `choose` and `life` as the second expression since `life` will be assigned the value of `choose` when `choose < life || choose < death`. The second expression is `choose - life`.\n\nSo, the multi-phase ranking function is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant death - life;\n    loop variant choose - life;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because, in each iteration, either the first expression decreases until it becomes non-positive or the second expression decreases once the first expression becomes non-positive, ensuring that the loop will eventually terminate."
