            "In the given program, the loop continues as long as `x` is greater than 0. Inside the loop, `x` is assigned the value of `y`, and `y` is assigned a new value. The loop breaks when `y > -old_y`. \n\nStarting values:\n- `x` and `y` are both initialized with `unknown_int()`, which can return any integer value.\n\nRanking function:\n- We don't have an explicit control on the values `x` and `y` can take, as they are assigned the return value of `unknown_int()`, which can be any integer. However, we do know that if `y` is ever greater than `-old_y` (i.e., `y` is less negative than `old_y`), the loop will break. \n- We can use `old_y` as the ranking function. Because `old_y` is always assigned the value of `y` before `y` is updated, `old_y` always holds the \"old\" value of `y`, i.e., the value of `y` from the previous iteration of the loop. As long as the loop continues, `old_y` must always be more negative than `y`, so `old_y` is decreasing with each iteration. \n\nLet's write this in ACSL syntax: \n```\n/*@\n    loop variant old_y;\n*/\n```",
            "The program starts with the declaration of two integer variables `x` and `y` which are assigned some unknown integer values. The loop executes as long as `x` is greater than 0. In each iteration of the loop, `x` is assigned the value of `y` and `y` is assigned a new unknown integer value. The loop breaks when `y` is greater than the negative of the old value of `y`.\n\nIn this case, it is hard to find a ranking function since the value of `y` is not determined. But we can say that the loop will terminate when `x` is not greater than 0 or `y` is greater than the negative of the old value of `y`.\n\nTherefore, a potential ranking function could be `x` because `x` is always decreasing (as `x` is assigned the value of `y` in each iteration and the value of `y` is always less than or equal to `x` in the previous iteration) and the loop continues as long as `x` is positive.\n\nThe ACSL annotation for the loop variant would look like this:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n*/\n```",
            "- The loop condition is `x > 0`. This means that the loop will continue executing as long as `x` is positive. \n- Inside the loop, `x` is assigned the value of `y`, and `y` is assigned the value of `unknown_int()`. \n- There is a `break` statement that will exit the loop if `y > -old_y`. \n\nBased on these observations, it is not possible to determine a ranking function for this loop. This is because the value of `y` (which determines the value of `x`) is assigned by a call to `unknown_int()`, the return value of which is not known. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that the value of `x` will decrease with each iteration of the loop. In fact, the loop could potentially continue indefinitely if `unknown_int()` always returns a positive value.\n\nFurthermore, the break condition (`y > -old_y`) is also dependent on the unknown return value of `unknown_int()`. Thus, we cannot determine a ranking function based on this condition either.\n\nIn conclusion, without additional information about the behavior of `unknown_int()`, it is not possible to define a ranking function for this loop.",
            "The program has two main variables, `x` and `y`. The loop continues to run while `x` is greater than 0. Inside the loop, `x` is assigned the value of `y` and then `y` is assigned a new unknown integer value. The loop breaks if `y` is greater than the negative value of the old `y`.\n\nBecause we do not know the exact value of `y` at each iteration (since it is assigned a new unknown integer value), it is difficult to determine a ranking function based on the values of `x` and `y`.\n\nHowever, we can say that for the loop to continue, `y` must be less than or equal to the negative value of the old `y`. This means that `y` is decreasing in each iteration. So, we can consider `-y` as a ranking function.\n\n```c\n/*@\n    loop variant -y;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because it decreases with each iteration of the loop (as `y` is decreasing) and it is positive as long as the loop continues (since `y` is less than or equal to 0).",
            "The loop condition is `x > 0`, so `x` is the loop variable. There are no explicit constraints for `x` and `y` at the start of the program, other than that they are integers (from the `unknown_int()` function). \n\nIn the loop body, `x` is assigned the value of `y` and `y` is then assigned a new unknown integer. The loop breaks if `y` becomes greater than the negation of its old value, `old_y`.\n\nGiven the conditions, it is not possible to find a simple ranking function for this program because the value of `x` (the loop variable) in the next iteration is dependent on `y`, which is an unknown integer. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that `x` will always decrease with each iteration. \n\nMoreover, without knowing the range of `unknown_int()`, we cannot establish an upper bound for `x` or `y`.\n\nHowever, if we make an assumption that `unknown_int()` returns a non-positive integer, then we can use `x` as the ranking function:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n*/\n```\n\nThis is a valid ranking function under the assumption because `x` is initially non-negative and decreases with every iteration (since `y` is assumed to be non-positive and `x` takes the value of `y` in each iteration). The loop continues as long as `x > 0`. \n\nPlease note that this ranking function is based on an assumption about the `unknown_int()` function.

Here's why:\n\n- x is always positive at the start of each loop iteration. It is updated to y, which is not guaranteed to be positive. However, the loop condition ensures that we only consider iterations where x remains positive.

Therefore, we cannot find a lexicographic ranking function for this loop.\n\nThe main reason is that, in this case, the value of 'x' (and consequently, the termination of the loop) depends on 'y', which is assigned a random value in each iteration.

We use implication for the break condition.\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x <= \\at(y, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant x > 0;\n    loop invariant \\at(x, LoopEntry) > x ==> x <= y;\n    loop invariant \\at(x, LoopEntry) == x ==> \\at(y, LoopEntry) > y;\n*/\n```\n\nThe first invariant ensures that `x` is always less than or equal to `y` at the beginning of the loop.\nThe second invariant is the loop condition which must hold true before every iteration.\nThe third invariant states that if `x` decreases, it is still less than or equal to `y`.\nThe fourth invariant states that if `x` remains the same, `y` decreases.\n\nThese invariants imply that the ranking function `(x, y)` decreases with every iteration, thus ensuring the termination of the loop."

This means that `y` is decreasing in every iteration once `x` becomes non-positive. \n\nThus, `y` can serve as the second ranking function. \n\nTherefore, the ranking function for this loop can be defined as follows:\n\n```c\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n    loop variant y;\n*/\n```",
            "The loop condition is x > 0, therefore x is live at the loop head. In the loop body, x is updated to y. Then y is updated to an unknown integer. If this integer is greater than the negative of the old value of y, the loop breaks.\n\nFor the first expression, we could use x, as it is immediately decreasing with each iteration of the loop. Since x is updated to y in each iteration, the loop will continue as long as y is positive.\n\nFor the second expression, we could use -y. This expression becomes non-positive when y becomes non-positive, which would happen when the unknown integer is less than or equal to the negative of the old value of y.\n\nTherefore, the multi-phase ranking function is (x, -y). \n\nThe first expression, x, is always decreasing as long as y is positive. Once x becomes non-positive, the second expression, -y, starts decreasing until it becomes non-positive. At this point, the loop will terminate.\n\nThe ranking function in ACSL syntax is:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n    loop variant -y;\n*/\n```"

Thus, `y` is either an unknown integer or a negative integer in every iteration.\n- After the loop termination, `x` is either equal to `0` or less than `0` because the loop continues as long as `x > 0`.\n\nThese can be written as follows:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant y == \\at(y, LoopEntry) || y < 0;\n    loop assigns x, y;\n    loop variant x;\n*/\n```",

Then, if y is greater than the negative of the old value of y, the loop breaks.\n\nAfter the loop termination, we know that x is less than or equal to 0, as that is the loop termination condition.\n\nWith these considerations, the following loop invariants can be deduced:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant \\at(x, LoopEntry) >= x;\n    loop invariant \\at(x, LoopEntry) == y ==> \\at(y, LoopEntry) >= y;\n*/\n```",
