            "The variables that are live at the loop head are `i`, `hash`, `h`, `rehash`, and `r`. The loop condition is `i < hash`.\n\nIn the body of the loop, the value of `i` is incremented by `r`. The value of `r` is determined in the loop body as well, and it is set to `(h % rehash) + 1` if `r` is 0. This means that `r` is always positive, and it is also constant during the loop execution after the first iteration. \n\nTherefore, `i` increases with every iteration of the loop. This means that the value of `hash - i` is decreasing with every iteration and is positive while the loop is executing. \n\nThus, the ranking function for the loop is `hash - i`.\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant hash - i;\n*/\n``` \n\nThis is a valid ranking function because it is positive (since `i < hash`) and is decreasing with each iteration (since `i` is incremented by `r` in each iteration).",

Hence, `i` is strictly increasing in each iteration.\n\nTherefore, a possible ranking function can be `hash - i`. This function will decrease in each iteration as `i` is increasing. The function is also positive when the loop is executing because `i` is always less than `hash`.\n\nHere is the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant hash - i;\n*/\n```",

After that `r` remains constant during the following iterations. And the loop continues until `i` is less than `hash`.\n\nWe can see that `hash` is the upper limit for `i`, and `i` is guaranteed to increase in every iteration of the loop, so the difference `(hash - i)` can be used as a ranking function. This is because `(hash - i)` is positive when the loop condition `i < hash` holds, and it decreases in every iteration as `i` is increased.\n\nTherefore, the ranking function in ACSL syntax is:\n\n```c\n/*@\n    loop variant hash - i;\n*/\n```",
