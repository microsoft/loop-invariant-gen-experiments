            "First, let's find the variables that are live at the loop head. In this case, the live variables are `x`, `y`, and `z`.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body:\n1. `x` is updated to `-x + y`\n2. `y` is updated to `z`\n3. `z` is incremented by 1\n\nThe loop continues executing as long as `x - y > 0`. So, we need to find a ranking function that involves `x`, `y`, and `z` and decreases with every iteration of the loop while being positive.\n\nLet's consider the ranking function `v = x - y`. It is positive when the loop is executing, and we need to show that it decreases with every iteration.\n\nAfter one iteration of the loop, the new values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are `-x + y`, `z`, and `z + 1`, respectively. The new value of `v` is `(-x + y) - z`. Let's analyze the change in `v`:\n\nChange in `v` = `(-x + y) - z - (x - y)` = `-x - x + y + y - z` = `-2x + 2y - z`\n\nNow we want to show that the change in `v` is negative, which means `-2x + 2y - z < 0`. We know that `x - y > 0` (loop condition), so `x > y`. Hence, `-2x + 2y < 0`. Since `z` is always incremented, it will only make the change in `v` more negative. Therefore, the ranking function `v = x - y` is decreasing with every iteration of the loop.\n\nHere's the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x - y;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because it is positive while the loop is executing and decreases with every iteration of the loop, ensuring that the loop must terminate.",

In each iteration of the loop, the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are updated as follows:\n\n- `x` is updated to `-x + y`\n- `y` is updated to `z`\n- `z` is updated to `z + 1`\n\nAs we can see, the value of `z` is strictly increasing in each iteration. We can use this to form our ranking function. Since the loop continues executing as long as `x - y > 0`, we know that the value of `x - y` must be positive for the loop to continue executing.\n\nA suitable ranking function in this case would be `x - y`, as it is positive while the loop is executing, and it decreases with every iteration of the loop.\n\nSo, the ranking function for the loop in the given program is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x - y;\n*/\n```\n\nThis is a valid ranking function because it is positive while the loop is executing, and it decreases with every iteration of the loop.

The value of `y` increases with every iteration of the loop (`y = z` and `z = z + 1`), so the ranking function is decreasing.\n2.

This means that x-y is always positive while the loop is executing.\n\nThe loop body has three assignments: x = -x + y, y = z, and z = z + 1. \n\n- The first assignment, x = -x + y, decreases x-y in each iteration. Since x-y is positive while the loop is executing and decreases in each iteration, it satisfies the requirements for the first expression in a lexicographic ranking function.\n\n- The second assignment, y = z, doesn't affect x-y. So, we need to look at the second expression in the ranking function. We choose -z because z is always increasing due to the third assignment, z = z + 1. So, -z is always decreasing. \n\n- Since z is always increasing, it doesn't have a specific upper bound. But, considering the loop's guard x-y > 0 and the assignment y = z, we can say that z should be less than x while the loop is executing. So, -z is negative and decreases in each iteration. This makes it a valid second expression in the lexicographic ranking function.\n\nTherefore, the lexicographic ranking function for this loop is (x-y, -z).\n\nSo, the ACSL syntax of the ranking function is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x-y;\n    loop variant -z;\n*/\n```",

In each iteration of the loop, the value of `x` is updated to `-x + y`, `y` is updated to `z`, and `z` is incremented by 1. \n\nLet's analyze the possible ranking functions:\n\n1. `x - y`: This is the loop condition and it decreases in every iteration of the loop. It is also positive while the loop is executing. \n\n2. `y - z`: This is calculated before `y` is updated to `z` in each iteration. It is also positive and decreases in every iteration. \n\nTherefore, the lexicographic ranking function for this loop is `(x - y, y - z)`. \n\nThis is a valid ranking function because both expressions are positive and decrease in every iteration of the loop. The first expression `x - y` decreases because `x` is updated to `-x + y` in each iteration. The second expression `y - z` decreases because `y` is updated to `z` in each iteration and `z` is incremented by 1.

Therefore, we can consider `(x - y)` as the first expression of the lexicographic ranking function. \n\nAdditionally, the value of `y` is also getting changed in each iteration due to the update `y = z`. So, we can consider `(y)` as the second expression of the lexicographic ranking function.\n\nFinally, the value of `z` is getting increased in each iteration due to the update `z = z + 1`. Therefore, we can consider `(-z)` as the third expression of the lexicographic ranking function. \n\nThe lexicographic ranking function for this program would be (x - y, y, -z).\n\nThis function is valid because:\n- `(x - y)` is positive (due to the loop condition) and decreases in each iteration.\n- If `(x - y)` remains the same, `y` decreases.\n- If both `(x - y)` and `y` remain the same, `-z` decreases.\n\nTherefore, the lexicographic ranking function in ACSL syntax would be:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x - y;\n    loop variant y;\n    loop variant -z;\n*/\n```",

The first invariant ensures x is non-increasing, and the second invariant combined with the third invariant ensures y is non-decreasing. \n\nThese invariants also imply that the loop terminates. The first invariant ensures x eventually becomes less than or equal to 0, so the loop condition (x - y > 0) eventually becomes false. \n\nBefore the loop execution, these invariants are trivially true because there are no prior assignments to x, y, and z.\n\nAfter the loop termination, these invariants are still true.

The second and third invariants are also true because y and z remain unchanged after the loop. \n\nThese invariants are valid as they are true before the loop execution, during every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination."

The value of z is strictly increasing as it is incremented with every iteration of the loop. Therefore, once x - y becomes non-positive, z starts decreasing.\n\nSo, the multi-phase ranking function for this program is (x - y, -z). This ranking function is valid as x - y decreases until it becomes non-positive, and then -z decreases until the loop terminates.\n\nThe ranking function in ACSL syntax is:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x - y;\n    loop variant -z;\n*/\n```",

This means that `x` is decreasing in each iteration of the loop, as long as `x > y`.\n- `y` is updated to `z`, which is incremented by 1 in each iteration. This implies that the value of `y` is increasing in each iteration.\n\nThus, we can conclude that the expressions `(x - y)` and `(-z)` can be used as multi-phase ranking functions. \n\nThe first expression `(x - y)` is positive at the start (as per the loop condition) and decreases with each iteration of the loop.
