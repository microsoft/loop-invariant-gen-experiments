Starting values or constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head:\n   Here, the variable `x` can have any value because it is assigned by the function `unknown_int()`, which may return any integer.\n\n2. Analyzing the loop body:\n   In each iteration of the loop, `x` is divided by 2. So, the value of `x` is decreasing in every iteration.\n\nConsidering these points, we can say that the ranking function for this program can be `x`. This is because `x` is always positive for the loop to continue executing and it decreases with every successive iteration of the loop.\n\nSo, the ranking function in ACSL syntax is:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n*/\n```",
