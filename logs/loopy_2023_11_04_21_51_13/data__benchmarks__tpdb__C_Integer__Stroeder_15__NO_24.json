We will now show that `a` is decreasing with every iteration of the loop and evaluates to a positive value while the loop is executing.\n\nInitially, `a = 1`. After the first iteration, `a` will be:\n\n```\na = a - b = 1 - 2 = -1\n```\n\nNow, `a` is negative, but the loop condition requires `a + b < 5`.

The value of `a` is positive during the loop execution: Initially, `a = 1`, and since `a + b < 5`, it means that `a` must be positive for the loop to continue executing.\n\n2. The value of `a` decreases with every iteration of the loop:\n\n   - After the first statement in the loop, `a = a - b`, which means `a` is now `-1`.\n   - After the second statement in the loop, `b = a + b`, which means `b` is now `1`.\n   - After the third statement in the loop, `a = b - a`, which means `a` is now `2`.\n\n   The value of `a` has increased in this case. Therefore, `a` is not a valid ranking function.\n\nLet's try the sum of `a` and `b`:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant a + b;\n*/\n```\n\nNow let's prove that it is a valid ranking function:\n\n1. The value of `a + b` is positive during the loop execution: Initially, `a + b = 3`, and since the loop condition is `a + b < 5`, the sum of `a` and `b` must be positive for the loop to continue executing.\n\n2. The value of `a + b` decreases with every iteration of the loop:\n\n   - After the first statement in the loop, `a = a - b`, which means `a` is now `-1`.\n   - After the second statement in the loop, `b = a + b`, which means `b` is now `1`.\n   - After the third statement in the loop, `a = b - a`, which means `a` is now `2`.\n\n   Now, `a + b = 3`, which is the same as the initial value. The value of `a + b` has not decreased in this case. Therefore, `a + b` is not a valid ranking function.\n\nSince neither `a` nor `a + b` are valid ranking functions, we must consider other possibilities. Since the loop's termination condition involves the sum of `a` and `b`, we can consider the absolute difference between `a` and `b` as our ranking function:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant (a > b ? a - b : b - a);\n*/\n```\n\nNow let's prove that it is a valid ranking function:\n\n1. The value of the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is positive during the loop execution: Initially, `|a - b| = 1`, and since `a + b < 5`, the absolute difference between `a` and `b` must be positive for the loop to continue executing.\n\n2. The value of the absolute difference between `a` and `b` decreases with every iteration of the loop:\n\n   - After the first statement in the loop, `a = a - b`, which means `a` is now `-1`.\n   - After the second statement in the loop, `b = a + b`, which means `b` is now `1`.\n   - After the third statement in the loop, `a = b - a`, which means `a` is now `2`.\n\n   Now, `|a - b| = 1`, which is the same as the initial value. The value of `|a - b|` has not decreased in this case.

To find the ranking function, let's analyze the values of `a` and `b` after each iteration:\n\n1. Initial values: `a = 1`, `b = 2`.\n2. First iteration: `a = -1`, `b = 1`.\n3. Second iteration: `a = 2`, `b = -1`.\n4. Third iteration: `a = 3`, `b = -3`.\n5. Fourth iteration: `a = 6`, `b = -9`.\n\nNotice that the value of `a + b` is decreasing by 2 in every iteration, and the loop condition is `a + b < 5`. Therefore, the ranking function is `5 - (a + b)`.\n\nIn ACSL syntax, the ranking function is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant 5 - (a + b);\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because it is decreasing with every iteration of the loop and is positive while the loop is executing.

The upper bound for the loop condition is 5, so the ranking function is:\n\n```\n5 - (a + b)\n```\n\nNow let's check if this ranking function is valid:\n1. It decreases with every iteration of the loop, as `a` and `b` both increase in every iteration.\n2. It is positive while the loop is executing, as the loop condition is `a + b < 5`.\n\nSo, the ranking function is valid.

So, `a + b = 3` which is less than 5. The ranking function `5 - (a + b)` is 2 which is non-negative. These form our initial loop invariants.\n\nDuring every iteration of the loop, the values of `a` and `b` are updated as follows: `a` becomes `a - b`, `b` becomes `a + b` (where `a` is the updated value of `a`), and `a` becomes `b - a` (where `a` and `b` are the updated values). As a result, `a + b` remains the same and hence is less than 5. The ranking function `5 - (a + b)` remains non-negative and decreases with every iteration of the loop. These are our loop invariants during the loop execution.\n\nAfter the loop termination, `a + b` is at least 5. The ranking function `5 - (a + b)` is non-positive. These are our loop invariants after the loop termination.\n\nHere are all the loop invariants in one code block:\n\n```c\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 1 <= a <= 5;\n    loop invariant 1 <= b <= 5;\n    loop invariant a + b < 5;\n    loop invariant 5 - (a + b) >= 0;\n    loop invariant \\at(a, LoopEntry) - \\at(b, LoopEntry) <= a <= \\at(a, LoopEntry) + \\at(b, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant \\at(a, LoopEntry) <= b <= \\at(a, LoopEntry) + 2 * \\at(b, LoopEntry);\n*/\n```",

The loop invariants imply that the ranking function decreases with every iteration because:\n\n   a. `a` and `b` are non-negative integers and they are bounded above by `(a + b) < 5` and below by `a >= 0` and `b >= 0`.\n   \n   b. The ranking function `(5 - (a + b))` is non-negative and decreases with every iteration. This is because `a` and `b` either stay the same or increase with every iteration, making `(5 - (a + b))` either stay the same or decrease.\n\nHence, the loop terminates."

In the subsequent iterations, `a + b` stays constant at `1` because the loop body ensures that their sum remains unchanged. So, the first expression in the ranking function is `a + b - 1`.\n\nFor the second expression, once the first expression becomes non-positive (i.e., when `a + b` is equal to 1), we can look at the value of `a`. As the loop continues to execute, `a` will keep decreasing.

A loop invariant is a condition that is initially true, remains true after each iteration, and is still true after loop termination.\n\nFrom the loop condition and the body, we can deduce the following loop invariants:\n\n- Before the loop execution and in every iteration, 'a' and 'b' are non-negative. This is because 'a' and 'b' are initialized to non-negative values and the loop body does not change the sign of these variables.\n- Before the loop execution and in every iteration, 'a' + 'b' is less than or equal to 5.

This means that the sum of `a` and `b` remains constant throughout each iteration of the loop.\n\nWe can also note that `b - a == \\at(b - a, LoopEntry)` in every iteration of the loop. This is because `a` is decremented by `b` and then `b` is incremented by the new value of `a`, which results in `b - a` staying constant.\n\nHowever, we must also consider the loop variant `(a + b, b - a)`. The first part of the variant, `a + b`, does not decrease because `a + b == \\at(a + b, LoopEntry)`.

The loop condition is \"a + b < 5\". This means that the sum of a and b must be less than 5 for the loop to continue.\n\nThe loop body contains three statements:\n- a = a - b;\n- b = a + b;\n- a = b - a;\n\nThese operations change the values of a and b in every iteration, and they should cause the ranking function (a, b) to decrease with every iteration.\n\nNow, let's find the loop invariants:\n\n- Before the loop execution, a is 1 and b is 2.

Therefore, we can say:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant \\at(a, LoopEntry) == 1;\n    loop invariant \\at(b, LoopEntry) == 2;\n*/\n```\n\n- In every iteration of the loop, a is decreased by b and then increased by b, and b is increased by a and then decreased by a. This means that the values of a and b oscillate between their initial values and their values after the operations. Therefore, we can say:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant a <= \\at(a, LoopEntry) + \\at(b, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant b <= \\at(a, LoopEntry) + \\at(b, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant a + b < 5;\n*/\n```\n\n- After the loop termination, the sum of a and b must be equal to or greater than 5, because that's the loop condition.
