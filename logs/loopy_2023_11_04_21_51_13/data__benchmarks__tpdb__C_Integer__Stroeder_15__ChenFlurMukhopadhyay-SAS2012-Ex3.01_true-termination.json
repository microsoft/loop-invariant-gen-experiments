In order for this function to decrease lexicographically in every iteration of the loop, the following must hold:\n- either y - x decreases, or\n- if y - x remains the same, y - z decreases.\n\nGiven the loop body, we can see that the first expression y - x decreases because x is incremented and y is set to z (which is not changing within the loop).\n\nHence, the loop invariants that support the validity of the ranking function and prove the termination of the loop are as follows:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant \\at(y, LoopEntry) >= \\at(x, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant y >= x;\n    loop invariant y == z;\n*/\n```\n\nLet's explain these invariants:\n- `\\at(y, LoopEntry) >= \\at(x, LoopEntry)`: At the beginning of the loop, y is greater than or equal to x. This is necessary for the loop condition x < y to be initially true.\n- `y >= x`: In every iteration of the loop, y is always greater than or equal to x. This is because y is set to the constant value of z, and x is incremented.\n- `y == z`: In every iteration of the loop, y is always equal to z. This is because y is directly set to the value of z in each iteration.",
                    "At the beginning of the program, the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` are initialized with some unknown integers. When the loop begins, it continues as long as `x` is less than `y`.\n\nInside the loop, `x` is incremented by `1` and `y` is set equal to `z`. \n\nThe ranking function given is `(y - x, y - z)`. From this, we can infer that `y - x` decreases in every iteration and if `y - x` remains constant, `y - z` decreases. \n\nHence, the loop invariants that can be derived to support the loop variant `(y - x, y - z)` are as follows:\n\n- Before the loop execution, `y` is greater than `x` as this is the condition for the loop to begin. Also, `y` is equal to `z` at the loop entry.\n- In every iteration of the loop, `x` is incremented by `1` and `y` is set to `z`. This ensures that `y - x` decreases in every iteration. If `y - x` remains constant, `y - z` decreases as `y` is set to `z`.\n- After the loop termination, `x` is equal to or greater than `y` as this is the condition for the loop to terminate.\n\nSo, the loop invariants to support the ranking function `(y - x, y - z)` are:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant \\at(y, LoopEntry) >= \\at(x, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant \\at(y, LoopEntry) == \\at(z, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant y - x <= \\at(y, LoopEntry) - \\at(x, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant y == z;\n    loop invariant x >= y;\n*/\n```\n\nNote that the first two loop invariants are true before the loop execution, the middle two are true in every iteration of the loop, and the last one is true after the loop termination.

So, initially, we have no constraints on the values of x, y, and z.\n\nThe loop condition is x < y. The loop body increments x by 1 and assigns the value of z to y.\n\nNow, we have to find the loop invariants that support the loop variant (y - x, y - z). \n\nWe can say that:\n1. Before the loop execution, it's true that y - x is greater than or equal to 0. This is because x is incremented by 1 in each loop iteration while y is set to z, which can be any integer, but the loop condition guarantees that x will not exceed y. \n\n2.

For y - z, it always stays the same before and during the loop execution because y is set to z in each loop iteration.
