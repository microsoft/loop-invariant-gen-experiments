In this case, they are `x` and `tmp`.\n\nThe loop continues to execute as long as `x` is greater than 0 and `x` is equal to `2*tmp`. Inside the loop, `x` is decremented by 1 and `tmp` is assigned an unknown integer.\n\nThe value of `x` is guaranteed to decrease with each loop iteration because it is decremented by 1 in the loop body. Therefore, `x` could be a candidate for the ranking function.\n\nHowever, we must also ensure that the ranking function is positive while the loop is executing. Since `x` is greater than 0 in the loop condition, it fulfills this criterion as well.\n\nTherefore, the ranking function for this loop is `x`.\n\nHere it is in ACSL syntax:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n*/\n``` \n\nThis is a valid ranking function because it always decreases with each iteration and is always positive as long as the loop continues to execute.",

The loop continues to execute as long as the condition `(x > 0) && (x == 2*tmp)` is true.\n\nIn each iteration of the loop, `x` is decremented by 1, and `tmp` is assigned a new, unknown value.\n\nTherefore, the value of `x` can be used as a ranking function, as it is always positive inside the loop (due to the loop condition `x > 0`), and it decreases in every iteration (as `x` is decremented by 1 in every iteration). \n\nThe ranking function for the loop in ACSL syntax is:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n*/\n```",

The value of `x` decreases by 1 in each iteration of the loop and it is positive while the loop is executing because of the loop condition `(x > 0)`. \n\nSo, the ACSL syntax for the ranking function would be:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n*/\n```\n\nThis satisfies the conditions of a ranking function since `x` is always positive during loop execution and it decreases with every iteration, which guarantees eventual termination of the loop.",
            "The loop condition is `(x > 0) && (x == 2*tmp)`. Therefore, we know that `x` must be positive for the loop to execute. \n\nInside the loop, `x` is decreased by 1 in each iteration and `tmp` is assigned an unknown value. \n\nSo, the loop decreases `x` in each iteration until `x` becomes non-positive or `x` is not equal to `2*tmp`. \n\nThis suggests that `x` could serve as a ranking function for the loop, as `x` is always positive when the loop is executing and decreases with every iteration. \n\nTherefore, the ranking function in ACSL syntax would be:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n*/\n```\nThis ranking function is valid because it decreases in each iteration (as `x` is decremented by 1) and is always positive while the loop is executing (as the loop condition requires `x` to be positive). The termination of this loop is guaranteed when `x` becomes non-positive or `x` is not twice `tmp`, which is ensured by the loop condition.",

However, the loop condition `((x > 0) && (x == 2*tmp))` enforces that `x` is positive and `x` is twice the value of `tmp`.\n\nInside the loop, `x` is decreased by 1 and `tmp` is reassigned the return value of `unknown_int()`.\n\nThe value of `tmp` is not guaranteed to decrease or increase in each iteration because it is assigned the return value of `unknown_int()`. However, we know that `x` is guaranteed to decrease by 1 in each iteration and that it starts as a positive integer.\n\nTherefore, `x` is a suitable ranking function. It is positive when the loop is executing, and it decreases with each iteration of the loop. This guarantees that the loop will eventually terminate because `x` will eventually become less than or equal to zero, causing the loop condition to fail.\n\nHere is the program with the ranking function:\n\n```\n#define assume(e) if(!(e)) return 0;\nextern int unknown_int(void);\n\ntypedef enum {false, true} bool;\n\nint main() {\n    int x, tmp;\n    x = unknown_int();\n    tmp = unknown_int();\n    /*@\n        loop invariant x >= 0;\n        loop variant x;\n    */\n    while ((x > 0) && (x == 2*tmp)) {\n        x = x - 1;\n        tmp = unknown_int();\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```"
