            "The loop is controlled by two variables: `x` and `b`.\n\nInitially, `x` and `b` are assigned arbitrary values, denoted by the function `unknown_int()`. \n\nIn the loop body, `b` is assigned another arbitrary value, then `x` is decremented by 1, and then `b` is assigned the value of `(x >= 0)`, meaning `b` becomes 1 if `x` is greater than or equal to 0 and `b` becomes 0 if `x` is less than 0.\n\nThe loop breaks when `b` becomes 0.\n\nWe can observe here that `x` is decreasing in every iteration of the loop, regardless of the value of `b`. So, `x` can be our first ranking function.\n\nOnce `x` becomes non-positive, `b` is set to 0 in the next iteration and the loop terminates. Thus, `b` can be our second ranking function.\n\nThe ranking functions in ACSL syntax are:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n    loop variant b;\n*/\n```",
            "Looking at the program, we can see that the loop continues indefinitely until the condition `!b` is met. This means that the loop termination is dependent on the value of `b` becoming false or 0. \n\nThe variable `b` is updated twice within the loop. The first update is a non-deterministic value from the function `unknown_int()`, and the second update is assigned the result of the condition `(x >= 0)`. \n\nThe variable `x` is also updated within the loop, with each iteration decreasing its value by 1. This decrement is deterministic and guaranteed to decrease with every iteration of the loop.\n\nThe ranking functions for this loop can be defined as follows:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n    loop variant b;\n*/\n```\n\nThe first ranking function `x` is a valid choice because it decreases with each iteration of the loop, irrespective of the value of `b`. \n\nThe second ranking function `b` is valid because it decreases when `x` becomes non-positive. This guarantees that `b` will eventually become 0, causing the loop to terminate. \n\nIn this case, the multi-phase ranking function can be used to prove termination of the loop. The first phase (decreasing `x`) ensures that `x` will eventually become non-positive, triggering the second phase (decreasing `b`) which ultimately causes the loop to terminate.",
            "The program starts by setting the variable `x` and `b` to an unknown integer value. Then it enters an infinite loop, where it first checks if `b` is not zero. If `b` is zero, it breaks the loop and the program ends. If `b` is not zero, it again sets `b` to an unknown integer value, then decreases `x` by one, and sets `b` to `1` if `x` is greater than or equal to zero, and `0` otherwise.\n\nThe loop will continue until `b` is not zero. But `b` becomes zero only when `x` is less than zero. So, the loop will continue until `x` becomes less than zero.\n\nThe variable `x` decreases by one in each iteration of the loop, so `x` can be the first ranking function. The loop will terminate when `x` becomes less than zero.\n\nThe variable `b` is used to control the termination of the loop. `b` is updated to `1` if `x` is greater than or equal to zero, and `0` otherwise. So, `b` can be the second ranking function. The loop will terminate when `b` becomes zero, which means `x` has become less than zero.\n\nSo, the multi-phase ranking function for this program is `(x, b)`. The first expression `x` decreases with each iteration of the loop, and when `x` becomes non-positive, the second expression `b` decreases and the loop terminates.\n\nThe ACSL syntax for the multi-phase ranking function is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n    loop variant b;\n*/\n```",
            "At the beginning of the loop, the variables that are live are `x` and `b`. We know that `x` is non-deterministic and `b` is non-deterministic, but it is either 0 or 1, because it is used as a boolean variable.\n\nLooking at the loop, we see that `b` is updated to be `x >= 0`, and `x` is always decremented by one. \n\nTherefore, `x` always decreases until it becomes negative, which will make `b` become 0 and break the loop.\n\nThus, the multi-phase ranking function for this loop is:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n*/\n```\nThis is a valid ranking function because `x` is always decreasing, and when `x` becomes negative, `b` is set to zero, which stops the loop.",
            "Here, we know that x is non-deterministically initialized to an unknown integer value. In the loop, x is decremented by 1 in each iteration, and the loop continues as long as x is greater than or equal to 0. Once x becomes less than 0, the loop terminates.\n\nTherefore, an appropriate ranking function for this loop would be x. For the initial iteration, x is positive. With each iteration, x decreases. When x becomes non-positive, the loop terminates. So, the ranking function is a valid one for this loop.\n\nThe variable b is non-deterministically updated, but it does not definitely decrease with every iteration of the loop, so it cannot be used in the ranking function.\n\nSo, the ranking function is:\n\n```c\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n*/\n```"

In this program, before the loop execution, the variable `x` is initialized with a non-deterministic integer value, and `b` also contains a non-deterministic integer value. \n- The loop does not have a regular condition; it is an infinite loop with a break condition inside. The break condition is `!b`, which means that the loop breaks when `b` is 0. \n- Inside the loop, `b` is first assigned a non-deterministic integer value. Then, `x` is decremented by 1.

We also know that `b` can be any integer value, but in C, any non-zero integer is considered as `true`. Therefore, before the loop execution, `b` is not zero.\n\n(ii) In every iteration of the loop, if `b` is not zero, `x` decreases by 1. If `b` is zero, the loop breaks.

The loop will always terminate because `x` is non-increasing and the loop breaks when `b` is zero.",

                    "First, let's understand what the loop is doing:\n\nThe loop continues as long as `b` is not zero. Inside the loop, `b` is first assigned a non-deterministic value. Then, `x` is decremented by one, and `b` is assigned the result of the comparison `(x >= 0)`. Therefore, the loop will terminate when `x` becomes negative.\n\nOur ranking function here is `x`. It is non-negative at the loop head (as ensured by the condition `b = (x >= 0)`) and decreases in each iteration of the loop (`x = x - 1`).\n\nThe loop invariants that we need to find should support these observations and also imply that `x` decreases with every iteration.\n\nLet's denote the value of `x` at the loop entry as `x0`. The loop invariants can be expressed as follows:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant \\at(x, LoopEntry) >= 0;\n    loop invariant x <= \\at(x, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant x >= 0 ==> b != 0;\n    loop invariant x < 0 ==> b == 0;\n*/\n```\nThese invariants state that:\n\n- `x` is non-negative at the loop entry.\n- `x` never increases inside the loop.\n- If `x` is non-negative, `b` is not zero (so the loop continues).\n- If `x` is negative, `b` is zero (so the loop terminates).\n\nThese invariants together imply that the ranking function `x` decreases with every iteration and that the loop terminates when `x` becomes negative.",
                    "At the beginning, the variables `x` and `b` are assigned some arbitrary values. We do not have any constraints on these variables at the beginning. We are not given any loop condition, but the termination of the loop is on the basis of `b`.\n\nIn the loop body, `b` is first assigned an arbitrary value, and then `x` is decreased by 1. After that, `b` is set to 1 if `x` is non-negative, and 0 otherwise. This means that the loop will continue as long as `x` remains non-negative.\n\nGiven these observations, we can conclude the following loop invariants:\n\n- `x` is non-negative at the beginning of each loop iteration. This is because `b` is 1 if and only if `x` is non-negative, and the loop continues only as long as `b` is 1.\n- `x` is decreasing with every iteration. This is because `x` is decreased by 1 in every iteration.\n\nLet's write these invariants in ACSL:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant \\at(x, LoopEntry) >= 0;\n    loop invariant x <= \\at(x, LoopEntry);\n*/\n```\n\nThe first invariant states that `x` is non-negative at the beginning of each loop iteration, and the second invariant states that `x` is decreasing with every iteration.\n\nThese invariants support the loop variant **(x)** and prove the termination of the loop. This is because `x` is a non-negative integer that is decreasing with every iteration, so it must eventually reach 0, at which point the loop will terminate."
