In the first phase, if `c1 <= c2`, the loop will terminate when `ac` reaches the value of `(unsigned char) c2`. In the second phase, if `c1 > c2`, the loop will wrap around, and the termination will occur when `ac` reaches `(unsigned char) c2` after wrapping around.\n\nNow we can define the ranking functions for both phases.\n\nFor the first phase, when `c1 <= c2`, the ranking function will be:\n`e1 = (unsigned char) c2 - ac`\n\nFor the second phase, when `c1 > c2`, the ranking function will be:\n`e2 = (unsigned char) c2 + 256 - ac`\n\nThese expressions are valid ranking functions because they decrease with each iteration of the loop and eventually become non-positive, causing the loop to terminate.\n\nFinally, the multi-phase ranking function in ACSL syntax is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant (c1 <= c2) ?

This is because the difference will decrease with each increment of `ac` until `ac` becomes equal to `(unsigned char)c2`.\n\nThere is no need for a second expression in this case, as the loop will terminate once the first expression becomes non-positive.

Since `ac` is incremented in each iteration, the difference decreases with each iteration.\n\nStep 3: Find the second expression that decreases once the first expression becomes non-positive.\nOnce the first expression becomes non-positive, it means `ac` has reached the maximum value of an unsigned char. In the next iteration, `ac` will wrap around to 0. Now we need to find an expression that decreases as `ac` approaches `(unsigned char)c2`.
