Analyze the loop body and find a ranking function involving the variables in the loop body:\n    - `i` can only increase in the loop body.\n    - `j` can increase by `k` in the loop body.\n    - `k` can be any unknown integer value, but the loop condition requires it to be greater than or equal to `tk + 1`.\n    - `an` and `bn` do not change in the loop body.\n    - `tk` can only take the old value of `k`.\n\n3. Based on the analysis, we can choose a ranking function that involves the upper bound of `i` and the old value of `k`:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant (an - i) + (k - 1);\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because:\n- It involves the variables `i` and `k` that change in the loop body.\n- It is positive while the loop is executing, as `(an - i)` is positive (because `an >= i` is a loop condition) and `(k - 1)` is also positive (because `k >= tk + 1` is a loop condition).\n- It decreases with every iteration of the loop, since `i` increases and `k` is replaced with a smaller or equal value `tk` (which is the old value of `k`).",
            "First, let's make note of the starting values or constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head.\n- i = unknown_int()\n- j = unknown_int()\n- k = unknown_int()\n- an = unknown_int()\n- bn = unknown_int()\n- tk = unknown_int()\n\nNow let's analyze the loop body and find a ranking function involving the variables in the loop body. We need to find an expression that is guaranteed to decrease with every iteration of the loop and is positive while the loop is executing.\n\nThe loop condition is as follows:\n```\n((an >= i && bn >= j) || (an >= i && bn <= j) || (an <= i && bn >= j)) && k >= tk + 1\n```\n\nWe can notice that `i` and `j` are the only variables that are being updated inside the loop. They are being updated in the following ways:\n- i = i + 1;\n- j = j + k;\n\nSince `i` and `j` are the only variables being updated, we can consider them for our ranking function. \nWe can form the ranking function as follows:\n```\ni + j\n```\n\nNow let's output the ranking function in one code block, in ACSL syntax.\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant i + j;\n*/\n```",

Let's simplify this condition:\n- `(an >= i && bn >= j) || (an >= i && bn <= j) || (an <= i && bn >= j)`\n- This is equivalent to `(an >= i && (bn >= j || bn <= j)) || (an <= i && bn >= j)`\n- Since `(bn >= j || bn <= j)` is always true, the condition simplifies to `(an >= i) || (an <= i && bn >= j)`.\n\n2. Now let's analyze the loop body to see how the variables are affected:\n- If `an >= i && bn >= j`, either `j = j + k` and `k = unknown_int()` or `i = i + 1`.\n- If `an >= i && bn <= j`, then `i = i + 1`.\n- If `an <= i && bn >= j`, then `j = j + k` and `k = unknown_int()`.\n\n3. Based on the loop body, we can see that `i` and `j` are increasing or staying the same in every iteration. Also, `k` is updated with an unknown value, and we do not have any constraints on it.\n\nNow, let's propose a ranking function:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant an - i;\n*/\n```\n\nLet's analyze why this is a valid ranking function:\n- The value of `an - i` is positive when the loop is executing because `an >= i`.\n- The value of `an - i` decreases with every iteration of the loop because `i` is increasing (or staying the same) in every iteration, and `an` is not being modified in the loop body.\n\nThus, the proposed ranking function `an - i` is a valid ranking function for the given loop.",
            "First, let's note the starting values or constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head:\n\n- `i`, `j`, `k`, `an`, `bn`, and `tk` are all assigned unknown integer values.\n- The loop condition is `((an >= i && bn >= j) || (an >= i && bn <= j) || (an <= i && bn >= j)) && k >= tk + 1`.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body and find a ranking function involving the variables in the loop body:\n\n- If `(an >= i && bn >= j)`, then either `j = j + k` or `i = i + 1`.\n- If `(an >= i && bn <= j)`, then `i = i + 1`.\n- If `(an <= i && bn >= j)`, then `j = j + k`.\n\nNotice that in all cases, either `i` or `j` increases. Therefore, a possible ranking function is the sum of the differences between `an` and `i`, and between `bn` and `j`. This sum will decrease with every iteration of the loop, and it will be positive while the loop is executing:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant (an - i) + (bn - j);\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because it is decreasing with every iteration of the loop and evaluates to a positive value while the loop is executing.",
            "1. First, let's identify the variables that are live at the loop head: `i`, `j`, `k`, `an`, `bn`, and `tk`.\n\n2.

We need a ranking function that decreases with every iteration of the loop. Since `i` and `j` are always increasing, we can use the difference between `an`, `bn`, and the respective variables `i`, `j`. \n\n4. The ranking function can be defined as `(an - i) + (bn - j)`. This function will decrease with every iteration of the loop, as either `i` or `j` will increase during each iteration.\n\n5. The loop condition ensures that at least one of the expressions `(an >= i)` or `(bn >= j)` holds true. This means that at least one of the terms `(an - i)` or `(bn - j)` will be non-negative, making the ranking function positive.\n\nNow, let's write the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```c\n/*@\n    loop variant (an - i) + (bn - j);\n*/\n```"

We know that `an` is always greater than or equal to `i` due to the loop condition. This means that the ranking function is always non-negative.\n\nNote that `i` increases by `1` in two cases:\n- When `an >= i && bn >= j` and `unknown_int()` returns `0`.\n- When `an >= i && bn <= j`.\n\nNote that `j` increases by `k` in two cases:\n- When `an >= i && bn >= j` and `unknown_int()` returns a non-zero value.\n- When `an <= i && bn >= j`.\n\nAlso note that `k` can be any value and `tk` is always the previous value of `k`.\n\nThe loop invariants to support the loop variant `(an - i)` are:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant an >= i;\n    loop invariant bn >= j ==> tk == \\at(k, LoopEntry) && k == unknown_int();\n    loop invariant an >= i && bn >= j && unknown_int() == 0 ==> i == \\at(i, LoopEntry) + 1;\n    loop invariant an >= i && bn <= j ==> i == \\at(i, LoopEntry) + 1;\n    loop invariant an <= i && bn >= j ==> j == \\at(j, LoopEntry) + k;\n    loop invariant an >= i && bn >= j && unknown_int() != 0 ==> j == \\at(j, LoopEntry) + k;\n*/\n```\nThese loop invariants ensure that the ranking function `(an - i)` decreases with every iteration of the loop, thus proving the termination of the loop.",

This is a simple ranking function. It is supposed to decrease in every loop iteration.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body and find the conditions under which `an` and `i` change.\n\n- `an` doesn't change in the loop.\n- `i` increases by `1` when either `an >= i && bn >= j` or `an >= i && bn <= j`.\n\nFrom the above, we can conclude that `an >= i` is an invariant. If `an < i` at any point, the loop would terminate, contradicting the fact that the loop invariant is supposed to hold for every loop iteration.\n\nLet's consider the condition `an >= i && bn >= j`. Under this condition, either `j` increases or `i` increases.

All of these conditions involve the variables `an`, `bn`, `i`, `j`, `k` and `tk`. The loop body contains if statements that are executed based on the conditions in the loop guard.\n\nNow, let's try to derive the loop invariants:\n\n- Before the loop execution, we don't have any specific information about the variables `i`, `j`, `k`, `an`, `bn` and `tk` as they are initialized with unknown values. So, the initial loop invariants would be the conditions from the loop guard.\n\n- During the loop execution, the value of `i` increases if either `(an >= i && bn >= j)` or `(an >= i && bn <= j)` holds. The value of `j` increases if either `(an >= i && bn >= j)` or `(an <= i && bn >= j)` holds. The value of `k` and `tk` may change in any iteration of the loop. So, during the loop execution, `i` and `j` can only increase while `k` can decrease or increase, and `tk` can only increase.\n\n- After the loop termination, we know that `an < i` or `bn < j` or `k < tk + 1` must hold, because the loop condition is negated.\n\nGiven these observations, the following are the loop invariants that support the loop variant `(an - i)`:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant an >= i ==> j <= \\at(j, LoopEntry) + k * (i - \\at(i, LoopEntry));\n    loop invariant an >= i && bn <= j ==> i > \\at(i, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant an <= i && bn >= j ==> j > \\at(j, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant an >= i && bn >= j ==> j <= \\at(j, LoopEntry) + k * (i - \\at(i, LoopEntry)) || i > \\at(i, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant an >= \\at(i, LoopEntry) && an >= \\at(j, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant bn >= \\at(i, LoopEntry) && bn >= \\at(j, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant tk <= \\at(k, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant k >= tk + 1;\n*/\n```\n\nThese invariants are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop and after the loop termination, and they imply that the ranking function `(an - i)` decreases with every iteration."

First expression: Since the loop continues while an >= i or bn >= j, we can use the difference between an and i and the difference between bn and j as our first expressions. To ensure the expressions are positive, we use the ternary operator to get the absolute values. So, the first expression is:\n```\n(an - i >= 0) ? (an - i) : -(an - i) + (bn - j >= 0) ? (bn - j) : -(bn - j)\n```\n\n2. Second expression: Once the first expression becomes non-positive, it implies that either an <= i or bn <= j. From the loop conditions, we can see that when an <= i and bn >= j, the value of j increases by k, and k is non-deterministically updated. However, k is always greater than or equal to tk + 1, which implies that k is decreasing. So, we can use k as our second expression.\n\nNow, let's put the ranking function expressions in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant (an - i >= 0) ? (an - i) : -(an - i) + (bn - j >= 0) ?

There are no explicit constraints on these variables at the loop head. \n\nNext, let's analyze the loop condition and the loop body.\n- The loop condition is complex and involves the values of \"an\", \"i\", \"bn\", \"j\", \"k\", and \"tk\". As for the loop body, it modifies \"i\", \"j\", \"k\", and \"tk\" based on the values of \"an\", \"bn\", \"i\", and \"j\". \n\nThe given ranking function is (an - i, bn - j).

This ensures that \"an - i\" or \"bn - j\" will decrease or remain the same.\n- If \"an >= i\" and \"bn <= j\", then \"i\" will increase by 1. This ensures that \"an - i\" will decrease.\n- If \"an <= i\" and \"bn >= j\", then \"j\" will increase by \"k\". This ensures that \"bn - j\" will decrease.\n\nThese loop invariants guarantee that the ranking function decreases with each iteration, and hence, the loop will eventually terminate.\n\nHere are the loop invariants:\n\n```c\n/*@ \n    loop invariant an == \\at(an, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant bn == \\at(bn, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant i >= \\at(i, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant j >= \\at(j, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant (an >= i && bn >= j) ==> (j == \\at(j, LoopEntry) + k || i == \\at(i, LoopEntry) + 1);\n    loop invariant (an >= i && bn <= j) ==> (i == \\at(i, LoopEntry) + 1);\n    loop invariant (an <= i && bn >= j) ==> (j == \\at(j, LoopEntry) + k);\n*/\n```",

The value of 'an' and 'bn' remain unchanged throughout the loop, while 'i' and 'j' can possibly increase in every iteration. Therefore, the ranking function always decreases in every iteration. \n\nFrom the loop body, it can be observed that if (an >= i and bn >= j), then either 'j' increases or 'i' increases. If (an >= i and bn <= j), then 'i' increases. If (an <= i and bn >= j), then 'j' increases.
