            "First, let's identify the variables that are live at the loop head:\n- `c`: It is initialized to `1` and is changed in the loop body depending on the condition `n > 100`.\n- `n`: It is initialized to an unknown integer and is changed in the loop body depending on the condition `n > 100`.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body and find a ranking function involving the variables in the loop body:\n- When `n > 100`, `n` decreases by `10` and `c` decreases by `1`.\n- When `n <= 100`, `n` increases by `11` and `c` increases by `1`.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we see that the value of `c` is not always decreasing. However, the value of `n` is bounded as it cannot keep increasing forever. When `n > 100`, `n` decreases by `10`, and when `n <= 100`, `n` increases by `11`. This means that `n` will eventually be less than or equal to `100` after some iterations, and `c` will start decreasing.\n\nBased on this observation, we can find a ranking function that involves both `c` and the difference between `n` and `100`. The ranking function will be `c + (n > 100 ? n - 100 : 0)`. This function will decrease with every iteration, and it will be positive as long as the loop continues executing.\n\nNow, let's write the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant c + (n > 100 ? n - 100 : 0);\n*/\n```\n\nThis is a valid ranking function because it decreases with every iteration and is positive while the loop is executing, ensuring that the loop eventually terminates.",
            "1. Make note of the starting values or constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head:\n   - `c` starts with the value 1\n   - `n` is an unknown integer\n\n2. Analyze the loop body and find a ranking function involving the variables in the loop body:\n   - The loop continues as long as `c > 0`\n   - Inside the loop, if `n > 100`, then `n` is decreased by 10 and `c` is decreased by 1\n   - Else, `n` is increased by 11 and `c` is increased by 1\n\nNow we need to find a ranking function that decreases with every iteration and is positive while the loop is executing. Let's define the ranking function as `R = c * (n - 100)`. \n\nWe can see that if `n > 100`, then `R` decreases with each iteration, because `c` decreases by 1 and `n` decreases by 10. On the other hand, if `n <= 100`, then `R` decreases with each iteration, because `c` increases by 1 but `n` increases by 11, so the decrease in `R` is `1 * (11 - 100) = -89`. Thus, `R` is decreasing with every iteration.\n\nTo show that `R` is positive during the loop execution, we can note that when `c > 0`, then `R = c * (n - 100)` is positive when `n > 100`, and negative when `n <= 100`. However, since the loop continues as long as `c > 0`, the ranking function `R` is positive while the loop is executing.\n\nSo, the ranking function is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant c * (n - 100);\n*/\n```",

The loop runs as long as `c > 0`. Inside the loop, we have two branches:\n\n1. If `n > 100`, the value of `n` decreases by 10, and the value of `c` decreases by 1.\n2. If `n <= 100`, the value of `n` increases by 11, and the value of `c` increases by 1.\n\nWe need to find a ranking function that decreases with each iteration and is positive as long as the loop continues executing.

            "First, let's make note of the starting values or constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head.\n\nIn the given program, the loop condition is `c > 0`, which means the loop will continue executing as long as `c` is positive. The variable `n` is updated in the loop body depending on the condition `n > 100`. \n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body and find a ranking function involving the variables in the loop body.\n\nThere are two cases in the loop body:\n1. When `n > 100`, `n` is decreased by 10, and `c` is decreased by 1.\n2. When `n <= 100`, `n` is increased by 11, and `c` is increased by 1.\n\nFor the ranking function, we need to find an expression that decreases with every iteration of the loop and is positive while the loop is executing. We can use the variable `c` itself as the ranking function because it decreases when `n > 100` and increases when `n <= 100`. However, since the loop terminates when `c` becomes non-positive, we need to find an expression that accounts for this condition as well.\n\nWe can use the expression `c * (n - 100)` as the ranking function. The expression is positive when `c > 0` and `n > 100`, and it is non-positive when `c <= 0` or `n <= 100`. Moreover, the expression decreases with every iteration of the loop when `n > 100`, as both `c` and `n` decrease in this case.\n\nThus, the ranking function for this loop can be represented in ACSL syntax as:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant c * (n - 100);\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because it decreases with every iteration of the loop when `n > 100` and is positive while the loop is executing.",
            "First, let's analyze the given program:\n\n1. The variables `c` and `n` are live at the loop head.\n2. At the beginning, `c` is set to 1 and `n` gets an unknown value.\n3. Inside the loop, there are two branches:\n   - If `n > 100`, then `n` is decreased by 10 and `c` is decreased by 1.\n   - If `n <= 100`, then `n` is increased by 11 and `c` is increased by 1.\n4. The loop continues as long as `c > 0`.\n\nNow, we need to find a ranking function involving `c` and `n`. Let's analyze how the values change in each branch:\n- In the first branch (`n > 100`), `c` decreases while `n` also decreases. \n- In the second branch (`n <= 100`), `c` increases while `n` increases.\n\nWe can use a ranking function that combines both `c` and `n`, and ensures that it decreases with every loop iteration.\n\nWe will consider the following ranking function: `c + (110 - n)`. Now let's analyze the ranking function for both branches:\n\n- In the first branch (`n > 100`), the ranking function becomes `c - 1 + (110 - (n - 10))`. This simplifies to `c + (120 - n)`. Since `n > 100`, we have `120 - n > 20`, so the ranking function decreases in this branch.\n- In the second branch (`n <= 100`), the ranking function becomes `c + 1 + (110 - (n + 11))`. This simplifies to `c + (99 - n)`. Since `n <= 100`, we have `99 - n >= -1`, so the ranking function decreases in this branch.\n\nAs the ranking function decreases in both branches, and it is positive while the loop is executing, we can use it as a valid ranking function. Here is the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant c + (110 - n);\n*/\n```"

When `n` remains the same (i.e., it is not greater than 100), `c` decreases. \n\nThis gives us the lexicographic ranking function as follows:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant n;\n    loop variant c;\n*/\n```\n\nThis is a valid ranking function because it satisfies the necessary conditions for lexicographic ranking functions. First, the first expression, `n`, is positive and decreases when it is greater than 100. Second, if `n` remains the same, the second expression, `c`, is positive and decreases. Therefore, this ranking function proves that the loop terminates.",
            "The loop in the given program is:\n```c\nwhile (c > 0) {\n  if (n > 100) {\n    n = n - 10;\n    c = c - 1;\n  } else {\n    n = n + 11;\n    c = c + 1;\n  }\n}\n```\nThis loop terminates when `c` becomes 0 or less. The loop condition is `c > 0`, so the loop continues as long as `c` is greater than 0. \n\nFrom the program, we can see that `c` is initially set to 1. In the loop, if `n` is greater than 100, then `c` is decreased by 1, else `c` is increased by 1. This means that `c` can potentially increase without bound if `n` is not greater than 100. \n\nHowever, we can also see that `n` is always increasing by 11 when `n` is not greater than 100, and it's decreasing by 10 when `n` is greater than 100. This means that eventually `n` will become greater than 100 and `c` will start to decrease.\n\nSo, the lexicographic ranking function can be `(c, n)`. \n\n`c` is positive and decreases when `n` is greater than 100. If `c` remains the same (which happens when `n` is not greater than 100), `n` is positive and increases. \n\nThus, either `c` decreases, or `c` stays the same and `n` increases, ensuring the termination of the loop. \n\nThe ranking function in ACSL syntax will be:\n```c\n/*@\n    loop variant c;\n    loop variant n;\n*/\n```",
            "The variables that are live at the loop head are `c` and `n`. \n\nWhen we first enter the loop, `c` is `1` and `n` is unknown. This is because the value of `n` is provided by the `unknown_int` function, which can return any integer value.\n\nIn the loop body, `c` and `n` are updated based on the condition `if (n > 100)`. If `n` is greater than `100`, `n` is decreased by `10` and `c` is decreased by `1`. If `n` is less than or equal to `100`, `n` is increased by `11` and `c` is increased by `1`.\n\nTherefore, the lexicographic ranking function for this loop would be `(c, n)`.\n\nLet's see why `(c, n)` is a valid ranking function:\n\n- `c` is always positive as per the loop condition `while (c > 0)`. This satisfies the requirement that the first expression in the ranking function is positive for the loop to execute.\n- `c` decreases when `n > 100`. This satisfies the requirement that the first expression in the ranking function decreases.\n- If `c` remains the same (which happens when `n <= 100`), then `n` is positive and decreases. This satisfies the requirement that if the first expression remains the same, the second expression is positive and decreases.\n\nTherefore, `(c, n)` is a valid lexicographic ranking function for this loop. Here is how we write it in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant c;\n    loop variant n;\n*/\n```\nThe ACSL syntax comments above specify that `c` and `n` are the lexicographic ranking function for the loop in the C program."

Therefore, `c` is not monotonically decreasing or increasing. Hence, `c` alone cannot be a ranking function.\n\nLet's look at `n`. The variable `n` is decreased by 10 when `n > 100` and increased by 11 when `n <= 100`. So `n` is not always decreasing or increasing. Therefore, `n` alone cannot be a ranking function.\n\nThe loop terminates when `c <= 0`. \n\nWe need to find two expressions such that the first expression decreases with every iteration until it becomes non-positive.

This expression is always positive and decreases with each iteration when `n > 100`. When `n <= 100`, the value of `c` increases, but that doesn't affect the ranking function because it will still be positive. Once `c` becomes non-positive, the value of the first expression becomes zero.\n\nThe second expression can be `(c <= 0 ? n : 0)`. This expression is always zero until `c > 0`.

However, because `c` increases when `n <= 100`, the case where `n > 100` will eventually become true again, causing `n` to decrease.
