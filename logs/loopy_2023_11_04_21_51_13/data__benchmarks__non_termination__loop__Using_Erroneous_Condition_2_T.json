It decreases because `i` increases by 1 in each iteration, while `reg_count` remains constant.\n\nTherefore, the ranking function for this loop is `reg_count - i`.\n\nHere it is in ACSL syntax:\n\n```c\n/*@\n    loop variant reg_count - i;\n*/\n```",

Therefore, `reg_count - i` is a valid ranking function for this loop.\n\n```c\n/*@\n    loop variant reg_count - i;\n*/\n``` \n\nThis ranking function is valid because it decreases with each iteration of the loop (since `i` increases) and it is positive as long as the loop continues to execute (since `i < reg_count`).
