            "First, we need to identify the variables that are live at the loop head. Those are `i` and `range`.\n\nNext, we need to analyze the loop body to determine how these variables are updated. We see that `i` is either decremented by 1 or negated, and `range` is either incremented by 1 or set to -1.\n\nThe loop continues while `-range <= i && i <= range`. This means that `i` must always be between `-range` and `range`. \n\nA valid ranking function for this loop could be `range - abs(i)`. This expression will always be positive since `i` is always less than or equal to `range`, and it is decreasing because `i` is either decremented or negated (which decreases its absolute value) and `range` is either incremented (which increases the difference between `range` and `abs(i)`) or set to -1 (which would end the loop). \n\nSo, the ACSL syntax for the loop variant would be:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant range - (i < 0 ? -i : i);\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function proves that the loop must terminate because it is positive and decreasing. The loop invariant (`-range <= i && i <= range`) ensures that the ranking function cannot become negative, and the updates to `i` and `range` in the loop body ensure that the ranking function decreases with each iteration. \n\nAs per the requirements, the ranking function does not involve any constants or functions not defined in the program, and uses the ternary operator to describe the absolute value of `i`.",
            "Before entering the loop, the variable `i` is assigned with an unknown integer value and `range` is assigned with the value 20. \n\nIn the loop, there are two conditions that modify the value of `i` and `range`. The first condition is `if (range-i < 5 || range+i < 5)`, where `i` is multiplied by -1. The second condition else branch, `i` is decremented by 1 and `range` is incremented by 1 until `i` becomes 0. When `i` is 0, `range` is set to -1. \n\nThe loop condition `-range <= i && i <= range` guarantees that the absolute value of `i` is always less than or equal to `range`. \n\nA valid ranking function for this loop is `range - |i|`, because:\n\n1. It is positive at the beginning of each loop iteration. `range` is initially 20, and `|i|` is less than or equal to `range`, which makes `range - |i|` positive.\n\n2. It is decreasing with each loop iteration. In each iteration, either `range` is incremented by 1 and `i` is decremented by 1, or `range` is set to -1 when `i` reaches 0. In both cases, the value of `range - |i|` is decreasing.\n\nACSL syntax for the ranking function is:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant range - (i < 0 ? -i : i);\n*/\n```",
            "The starting values for the variables `i` and `range` are unknown and 20 respectively. Both variables are live at the loop head. \n\nIn the loop body, `i` and `range` can both change. `i` can either increase, decrease, or stay the same, and `range` can either increase or stay the same.\n\nIn the first branch of the if statement, `i` is multiplied by -1. This does not guarantee a decrease in the value of `i`, but it does guarantee a change in sign. \n\nIn the second branch of the if statement, `range` is incremented by 1, and `i` is decremented by 1. This guarantees that the value of `i` decreases. If `i` becomes 0, `range` is set to -1. \n\nOverall, the value of `i` is decreasing in every loop iteration.\n\nThe loop condition checks if `i` is within a range from `-range` to `range`. As long as `i` is within this range, the loop will continue executing. \n\nTherefore, the ranking function for this loop can be `range - abs(i)`.\n\nThis is a valid ranking function because:\n\n- It involves the variables `i` and `range`, which are both live at the loop head and can change during the execution of the loop.\n- The value of the function decreases with every iteration of the loop. This is because `i` is always decreasing and `range` is always increasing or staying the same.\n- The value of the function is positive as long as the loop is executing. This is because `i` is always within the range from `-range` to `range`.\n\nIn ACSL syntax, the ranking function can be written as:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant range - (i < 0 ? -i : i);\n*/\n```",
            "The loop in the given program continues until `i` is not within the range of `-range` and `range`. Inside the loop, there are two cases:\n1. If `range-i` is less than 5 or `range+i` is less than 5, `i` is multiplied by `-1`.\n2. Otherwise, `range` is increased by 1, `i` is decreased by 1, and if `i` is 0, `range` is set to -1.\n\nSince `range` is always increasing in the second case and it's never decreased, it can't be used as a ranking function. On the other hand, `i` is decreased by 1 in the second case or is multiplied by `-1` in the first case, which decreases its absolute value. \n\nSo, we can use the absolute value of `i` as a ranking function. In ACSL, absolute value can be expressed using the ternary operator: `(i >= 0 ? i : -i)`. This expression is positive, and it decreases with each iteration of the loop.\n\nThis is the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant (i >= 0 ? i : -i);\n*/\n```\n\nThis function is valid because it is positive for every loop iteration (as `i` is within the range of `-range` and `range`), and it decreases with each loop iteration (as `i` is either decreased or its absolute value is decreased), ensuring that the loop must terminate.",
            "First, we need to identify the variables that are live at the loop head. In this case, these are `i` and `range`.\n\nSecond, we need to analyze the loop body. Inside the loop, there are two main paths. If `range-i < 5` or `range+i < 5`, `i` is multiplied by `-1`. Otherwise, `range` is incremented by `1` and `i` is decremented by `1`. If `i` becomes `0`, `range` is set to `-1`.\n\nGiven that `i` can be negative, positive, or zero and `range` always remains positive or becomes `-1` when `i` is `0`, and that the loop continues as long as `-range <= i <= range`, we can create a ranking function based on these variables and conditions.\n\nThe ranking function `2*range - i` should satisfy our conditions. If `range-i < 5` or `range+i < 5`, `i` is multiplied by `-1` and the value of the ranking function decreases. Otherwise, `range` is incremented by `1` and `i` is decremented by `1`, which also causes the ranking function to decrease. Moreover, if `i` becomes `0` and `range` is set to `-1`, the loop terminates which is consistent with our requirement that the ranking function should be positive when the loop is executing.\n\nSo, the ranking function is:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant 2*range - i;\n*/\n```\nThis is a valid ranking function as it decreases with each iteration and is positive as long as the loop continues executing."

            "First, observe the loop condition. The loop will continue as long as `-range <= i <= range`. This means that `i` is always between `-range` and `range`.\n\nLet's analyze the loop body. There are two main cases:\n- If `range-i < 5 || range+i < 5`, then `i` is negated. This keeps `i` within the range of `[-range, range]`.\n- Otherwise, `range` is incremented and `i` is decremented. If `i` reaches `0`, `range` is set to `-1`.\n\nThe loop will terminate when `i` is no longer within the range `[-range, range]`. This happens when `range` becomes negative while `i` is not `0`, or `i` becomes less than `-range` or greater than `range`.\n\nNow let's find the ranking function. We need to find an expression that is positive and decreases with every iteration.\n\nConsider `range+1`. This expression is always positive because `range` is initially `20` and only increases or is set to `-1`, at which point the loop will terminate. Furthermore, this expression decreases whenever `i` is not negated, because `range` is incremented while `i` is decremented.\n\nNext, consider `range-i`. This expression is positive because `i` is always between `-range` and `range`. It decreases whenever `i` is not negated, because `i` is decremented while `range` is incremented.\n\nFinally, consider `range+i`. This expression is also positive and decreases whenever `i` is not negated for the same reason as `range-i`.\n\nTherefore, the lexicographic ranking function is `(range+1, range-i, range+i)`. This function is valid because each expression is positive and decreases whenever the preceding expressions remain the same.\n\nThe corresponding code block is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant range+1;\n    loop variant range-i;\n    loop variant range+i;\n*/\n```",
            "Firstly, let's identify the variables that are live at the loop head. In this case, they are `i` and `range`.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body. The loop body has two branches. In the first branch, `i` is negated. In the second branch, `range` is incremented by 1 and `i` is decremented by 1.\n\nIn the loop condition, it is checked whether `i` lies within the range of `-range` and `range`. Thus, `range` is always greater or equal to `i`.\n\nOur goal is to find a ranking function such that:\n- The first expression in the ranking function is positive and decreases.\n- If the first expression remains the same, the second expression is positive and decreases.\n- If the first and second expressions remain the same, the third expression is positive and decreases and so on.\n\nWe can see that `range` is incremented by 1 in every iteration of the loop, and `i` is either negated or decremented by 1. Therefore, the absolute value of `i` decreases in every iteration of the loop, and `range` increases. This means that `range - abs(i)` increases in every iteration of the loop, and is always positive while the loop is executing.\n\nTherefore, the lexicographic ranking function for this loop is (range - abs(i)).\n\nHere is the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant range - (i >= 0 ? i : -i);\n*/\n```",

This means that `i` must be within `range` and `-range`.\n\n2. In the loop body, `i` is either decreased or it is multiplied by `-1`. `range` is either increased or set to `-1`.\n\n3. The loop terminates when `i` is not within `range` and `-range`.\n\nGiven this, we can see that both `i` and `range` are decreasing in absolute values, as `i` is always moving closer to zero and `range` is always increasing.\n\nTherefore, a valid lexicographic ranking function for this loop could be `(range - abs(i), abs(i))`. \n\nHere's why this is a valid ranking function:\n\n- `(range - abs(i))` decreases each time the loop runs. This is because `i` is either decreased or its sign is flipped, which means that `abs(i)` either decreases or remains the same. However, `range` is always increasing, which means that `range - abs(i)` is always decreasing.\n\n- If `(range - abs(i))` remains the same, then `abs(i)` decreases. This is because `i` is either decreased or its sign is flipped. \n\nTherefore, this ranking function will always decrease, which shows that the loop will terminate.\n\nOutput the ranking function in ACSL syntax, in their lexicographic order:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant range - abs(i);\n    loop variant abs(i);\n*/\n```",

We have two variables, `i` and `range`. `i` is initialized to an unknown integer value and `range` is initialized to `20`.\n\nThen, we analyze the loop body. We see that:\n- If either `range-i < 5` or `range+i < 5` is true, `i` is multiplied by `-1`.\n- If both conditions are false, `range` is incremented by `1` and `i` is decremented by `1`. If `i` becomes `0`, `range` is set to `-1`.\n\nThe loop condition is `-range <= i && i <= range`. This means that the loop continues to execute as long as `i` is within the range of `-range` and `range`.\n\nFrom the loop body and loop condition, we can see that `i` and `range` are both live at the loop head and change within the loop.\n\nA possible lexicographic ranking function is `(range+i, range-i)`. This is because:\n- `range+i` is always positive during loop execution because of the loop condition `-range <= i && i <= range`.\n- `range+i` decreases whenever `i` decreases or `range` decreases.\n- `range-i` is always positive during loop execution because of the loop condition `-range <= i && i <= range`.\n- `range-i` decreases whenever `i` increases or `range` decreases.\n\nThis lexicographic ranking function can be expressed in ACSL syntax as:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant range+i;\n    loop variant range-i;\n*/\n```\nThis ranking function provides a measure of the \"progress\" of the loop, in terms of the decreasing values of `range+i` and `range-i`. Since these values decrease with each loop iteration and are always positive during loop execution, we can conclude that the loop terminates.",
            "First, let's note the starting values or constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head. The variable `i` is an unknown integer, and `range` is set to 20.\n\nIn the loop body, we see that `i` and `range` can both change. The first condition checks whether the absolute difference between `range` and `i` is less than 5 or the sum of `range` and `i` is less than 5. If either of these is true, then `i` is negated. If not, then `range` is incremented by 1, `i` is decremented by 1, and if `i` becomes 0, then `range` is set to -1.\n\nThis is a bit complicated, but we can still find a ranking function. The key is to realize that `range` is always increased, and `i` is either decreased or negated. \n\nTherefore, a valid lexicographic ranking function for this loop could be `(range, abs(i))`.\n\nHere's why:\n- `range` is always increased. Therefore, it will always be positive and will increase with every iteration. This satisfies the requirements for the first expression of a lexicographic ranking function.\n- `abs(i)` is the absolute value of `i`. Since `i` is either decreased or negated in the loop, `abs(i)` will always decrease with every iteration. Furthermore, `abs(i)` will always be positive as long as the loop is executing, because the loop condition requires `-range <= i && i <= range`.\n\nSo, the lexicographic ranking function in ACSL syntax would be:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant range;\n    loop variant (i >= 0 ? i : -i);\n*/\n```\nThis function guarantees that the loop terminates because each expression in the sequence strictly decreases with every iteration, as required by the definition of a lexicographic ranking function."

            "First, let's analyze the loop body. The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range [-range, range]. Inside the loop, there are two possibilities:\n\n1. If `range-i` is less than 5 or `range+i` is less than 5, then `i` is negated.\n2. Otherwise, `range` is incremented, `i` is decremented, and if `i` hits zero, `range` is set to -1.\n\nThe behaviour of the loop heavily depends on the initial value of `i`.\n\nNow, let's try to find expressions that are decreasing at some point.\n\n1. `range - i`: This expression is not always decreasing, because `i` can be negated, but when `range-i >= 5` and `range+i >= 5`, `i` is decremented and `range` is incremented, so this expression decreases.\n\n2. `range + i`: Similar to the first expression, this one is not always decreasing because `i` can be negated. However, when `range-i >= 5` and `range+i >= 5`, `i` is decremented and `range` is incremented, so this expression decreases.\n\n3. `range`: This expression is always increasing when `range-i >= 5` and `range+i >= 5`, but when `i` hits zero, `range` is set to -1, so it drastically decreases.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can see that the expressions `range - i` and `range + i` start decreasing once they become larger or equal to 5. Once `i` hits zero, `range` decreases to -1. Thus, we have a multi-phase ranking function `(range - i, range + i, range)`. \n\nThe multi-phase ranking function in ACSL syntax would be:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant range - i;\n    loop variant range + i;\n    loop variant range;\n*/\n```\nThis ranking function is valid because each expression decreases at some point, ensuring the termination of the loop.",
            "The variables that are live at the loop head are `i` and `range`.\n\nThe loop condition `-range <= i && i <= range` shows that the loop continues as long as `i` is within the range of `-range` to `range`.\n\nLet's analyze the loop body:\n\n- If `(range-i < 5 || range+i < 5)`, then `i = i*(-1)`. This inverts the sign of `i` but does not guarantee a decrease in `i`'s absolute value. Thus, we cannot use `i` or a function of `i` alone as a ranking function.\n\n- If `!(range-i < 5 || range+i < 5)`, then `range = range+1; i = i-1;`. Here, `range` is increasing and `i` is decreasing. If `i` becomes `0`, then `range` is set to `-1`.\n\nGiven these conditions, we can derive a multi-phase ranking function as follows:\n\n1. The first expression can be `range`, which increases when `i` is not zero and decreases to `-1` when `i` becomes zero. This ensures that the expression `range` eventually becomes non-positive.\n\n2. Once `range` becomes non-positive, `i` decreases with each iteration of the loop. So, the second expression can be `i`.\n\nTherefore, the multi-phase ranking function is `(range, i)`. The validity of this ranking function comes from the fact that `range` eventually becomes non-positive, at which point `i` becomes the decreasing variable that leads to the termination of the loop.\n\nThe multi-phase ranking function in ACSL syntax is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant range;\n    loop variant i;\n*/\n```",

If `i` becomes 0, `range` is set to -1.\n\nThe first expression of the ranking function can be `range`, as it is always incremented in the loop (unless `i` becomes 0, in which case `range` is set to -1 and the loop terminates).\n\nThe second expression of the ranking function can be `i`, which is either decremented by 1 or flipped to `-i` in each loop iteration, but is always within the bounds of `-range` and `range`.\n\nThe resulting ranking function in ACSL syntax is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant range;\n    loop variant i;\n*/\n```\n\nThis is a valid multi-phase ranking function because `range` always increases with each loop iteration (unless `i` is 0, in which case the loop terminates), and `i` always decreases until it becomes 0, at which point `range` is set to -1 and the loop terminates. Both `range` and `i` are thus strictly decreasing over the course of the loop's execution, proving termination.",
            "The variables alive at the loop head are `i` and `range`. The loop condition is `-range <= i && i <= range`. Inside the loop body, `i` and `range` are updated. \n\nIn the loop body, there are two branches. In one branch `i` is negated, in the other branch `range` is incremented and `i` is decremented. Also, when `i` is 0, `range` is set to -1. \n\nWe can see that `range` is always non-negative and `i` is bounded by `range` on both sides. The termination condition of the loop is when `i` is outside the bound of `range`.\n\nThe first ranking function is `range - abs(i)`. This function is initially positive because `i` is within `range`, and decreases as `i` approaches the boundary of `range`. \n\nOnce `range - abs(i)` becomes non-positive, meaning `i` has reached the boundary of `range`, the loop enters the second phase. In this phase, `i` is negated until `i` is zero. So, the second ranking function is `abs(i)`.\n\nIn the third phase, `i` is zero and `range` is set to -1, which makes the loop condition false and terminates the loop.
