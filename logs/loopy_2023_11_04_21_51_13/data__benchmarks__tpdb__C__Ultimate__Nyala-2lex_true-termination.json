Inside the loop, y is decremented in every iteration. If y becomes negative, x is decremented and y is reset to a non-deterministic value.\n\nThe ranking function is (x, y >= 0 ? y : -y). This is a lexicographic ranking function. The first expression is x, which decreases when y becomes negative. The second expression is y >= 0 ? y : -y, which also decreases in every iteration.\n\nNow, let's find the loop invariants.\n\nThe loop invariants that are true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop are:\n- x is non-negative: This is implied by the loop condition.\n- y decreases in every iteration: This is implied by the statement y = y - 1.\n- y is reset to a non-deterministic value when it becomes negative: This is implied by the statement y = unknown_int().\n\nThe loop invariants that are true after the loop termination are:\n- y is non-negative: This is implied by the condition y < 0 which leads to the break statement.\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant y <= \\at(y, LoopEntry) + 1;\n    loop invariant y < 0 ==> y == \\at(y, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant \\at(y, LoopExit) >= 0;\n*/\n```",
