The loop condition is `x > 0`.\n\nIn the loop body, `x` is updated to `x + x + y` and `y` is decreased by 1. \n\nTo prove termination, we need to find a lexicographic ranking function such that it decreases with every iteration of the loop.\n\nIn this case, we can choose `(x, y)` as the lexicographic ranking function. \n\n`x` is the first expression in the ranking function. It is positive as per the loop condition and it decreases with every iteration of the loop because `y` is subtracted from `x`. \n\n`y` is the second expression in the ranking function.

If x remains the same, y is negative and -y is positive, which decreases with each iteration. Therefore, the loop will eventually terminate.\n\nThe ranking function is:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n    loop variant -y;\n*/\n```",

The first expression, x, is always positive when the loop is executing and decreases in each iteration (since y is always nonpositive in the loop, x = x + x + y will be less than or equal to the old x). The second expression, -y, is always positive when the loop is executing and decreases in each iteration (since y is decreased by 1 in each iteration).\n\nThus, the ranking function is valid.\n\nHere is the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n    loop variant -y;\n*/\n```",

After the execution of the loop body, `x` can either remain the same or increase, and `y` always decreases. \n\nTherefore, the lexicographic ranking function `(x, y)` is valid because `x` is always positive and `y` decreases whenever `x` remains the same. \n\nSo, in ACSL syntax, the lexicographic ranking function can be written as follows:\n\n```c\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n    loop variant y;\n*/\n```",

Therefore, y is positive and decreases at each iteration of the loop.\n\n- The second expression, -x, is positive and decreases if the first expression remains the same.
