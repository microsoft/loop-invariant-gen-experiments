So, we can use the expression `x + y*(y + 1)` as our ranking function.\n\nLet's see why it's a valid ranking function:\n\n1. At the start of the loop, x is positive (due to the loop condition), and y can be any integer value. Since y is squared in the expression, the ranking function will always be positive.\n\n2.

We need to find a function that decreases with each iteration and is positive while the loop executes.\n\nA possible ranking function for this loop is `x + 2*y`. Let's see why this is a valid ranking function.\n\n- Before the loop starts, `x` and `y` can have any integer values. However, the loop only executes when `x > 0`. So, the ranking function `x + 2*y` will be positive at the beginning.\n- During the loop execution, the value of `x` is decreased by `2*y` and `y` is incremented by 1. So, the new value of the ranking function is `(x - 2*y) + 2*(y + 1) = x + 2`. As we can see, the ranking function decreases by 2 with every iteration.\n- The loop continues to execute as long as `x > 0`. As the ranking function decreases by 2 each time, it will eventually become non-positive, causing the loop to terminate.\n\nTherefore, the ranking function `x + 2*y` is valid for this loop.

In the body of the loop, `x` is decreased by `2*y` and `y` is incremented by 1.\n\nA possible lexicographic ranking function for this loop is `(x, -y)`.\n\nThe first expression, `x`, is always positive at the beginning of the loop because of the loop condition `x > 0`.

The value of `x` decreases with each loop iteration (due to the operation `x = x - 2*y`) while the value of `y` increases (due to the operation `y++`). We can use these two variables, `x` and `y`, to construct a lexicographic ranking function.\n\nThe first expression in the ranking function is `x`, which is positive and decreases with each iteration. However, if `x` remains the same, then `y` is the second expression in the ranking function which is positive and decreases (as it is incremented in each iteration).\n\nHence, the lexicographic ranking function for the loop in this program is `(x, -y)`.

Inside the loop, `x` is decremented by `2*y` and `y` is incremented by `1` in each iteration.\n\n- We need to find a lexicographic ranking function such that the first expression decreases with every iteration of the loop, and evaluates to a positive value while the loop is executing. If the first expression remains constant, then the second expression should decrease with every iteration of the loop, and evaluate to a positive value while the loop is executing, and so on.\n\n- The loop condition is `x > 0`, so `x` is a candidate for the first component of the ranking function, as it is positive and strictly decreasing.\n\n- The second expression of the lexicographic ranking function should be decreasing when `x` remains constant. However, `x` never remains constant in the loop as it is always decremented by `2*y`. So, we don't have to consider other variables for the lexicographic ranking function.\n\nSo, the lexicographic ranking function is `(x)`.\n\nThe ranking function can be written in ACSL syntax as:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n*/\n```\n\nThis is a valid ranking function because `x` is always positive at the start of each loop iteration, and it strictly decreases in each iteration.

Also, `x` is being decreased by `2*y` in each iteration of the loop, and `y` is being incremented by 1.\n\nThe ranking function could be `(x, -y)`. Here's why:\n\n- `x` is always positive at the start of each loop iteration due to the loop condition, and it decreases with each iteration as `2*y` is being subtracted from it.\n- If `x` remains the same, `-y` is positive and decreases.

This can be written in ACSL syntax as:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n    loop variant -y;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function ensures that the loop will eventually terminate as `x` will eventually become less than or equal to 0, and `-y` will continue to decrease if `x` remains the same.",

This means that `y` is increasing with each iteration of the loop.\n\nFrom these observations, we can construct a lexicographic ranking function: `(x, -y)`. Here, `x` is the first expression that decreases with each iteration and is positive as long as the loop continues. `-y` is the second expression that also decreases with each iteration (since `y` is increasing, `-y` is decreasing). Since `y` is incremented in each iteration, `y` is always positive, which means `-y` is always negative.\n\nThis ranking function can be expressed in ACSL syntax as follows:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n    loop variant -y;\n*/\n```\nThis is a valid ranking function because it fulfills all the required properties: each expression in the ranking function is positive as long as the loop continues, and decreases with each iteration."
