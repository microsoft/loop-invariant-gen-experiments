In each iteration, `y` is incremented by `x`, and `z` is incremented by `-x`. So, one of them is increasing, and the other is decreasing.\n\nWe can use the absolute difference between `y` and `z` as the ranking function. This is because the absolute difference will always decrease after each iteration, and it will be positive as long as the loop is executing.\n\n3.

Let's verify its properties:\n\n1. Positive while the loop is executing: As long as `y < 100` and `z < 100`, the ranking function value will be positive.\n\n2. Decreasing with every iteration of the loop:\n   - If x = 1, then y increases and z decreases, making the absolute value of both y and z increase, resulting in a decrease in the ranking function value.\n   - If x = -1, then y decreases and z increases, again making the absolute value of both y and z increase, resulting in a decrease in the ranking function value.\n\nHence, the ranking function is valid.

The variables `y`, `z`, and `x` are live at the loop head.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body. The loop body increments `y` by `x` and decrements `z` by `x`. \n\nWe can choose the ranking function as `200 - y - z`. Let's explain why this is a valid ranking function.\n\n1. The ranking function is positive while the loop is executing: Since both `y` and `z` are less than 100 during the loop execution, `200 - y - z` will always be positive.\n\n2. The ranking function decreases with every iteration of the loop: In each iteration, `y` is incremented by `x` and `z` is decremented by `x`. Thus, the sum `y + z` increases by `2 * x` in each iteration. Since `x` is either 1 or -1, the increment is either 2 or -2. In both cases, the ranking function `200 - y - z` decreases with every iteration.\n\nNow let's output the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant 200 - y - z;\n*/\n```",

In each iteration, `y` is increased by `x` and `z` is decreased by `x`. Since `x` can be either 1 or -1, the value of `y` can either increase or decrease, and the value of `z` can either increase or decrease. We need to find a ranking function that decreases with every iteration of the loop and remains positive while the loop is executing.\n\nSince `y` and `z` are being updated by the same absolute value (the absolute value of `x`), their sum remains constant throughout the loop. Therefore, the ranking function can be the absolute difference between `y` and `z`.\n\nNow let's verify that this ranking function is decreasing with every iteration of the loop and remains positive while the loop is executing. In each iteration, the absolute difference between `y` and `z` either increases or decreases by the absolute value of `x`. Since the loop condition requires both `y` and `z` to be less than 100, the absolute difference between `y` and `z` must be decreasing.\n\nThe ranking function is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant (y >= z) ? (y - z) : (z - y);\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because it decreases with every iteration of the loop and remains positive while the loop is executing.

So, the sum `y + z` will remain constant throughout the loop iterations. Let's take this sum as our ranking function `v`. Thus, `v = y + z`.\n\nLet's verify if `v` is a valid ranking function:\n1. The value of `v` must decrease with every successive iteration of the loop. However, since `v = y + z` remains constant, it neither increases nor decreases, and hence the loop terminates.\n2. The value of `v` must be positive for the loop to continue executing. Since `y` and `z` are both less than 100, their sum will also be less than 200 and positive.\n\nSo, the ranking function for the given loop is `y + z`.

This means that, for the loop to execute, both y and z must be less than 100. Inside the loop body, y is incremented by x and z is decremented by x. Depending on the value of x, either y or z will decrease at each iteration.\n\nLet's find a lexicographic ranking function for this loop:\n\nIf x = 1, y is increasing and z is decreasing.\nIf x = -1, y is decreasing and z is increasing.\n\nTherefore, we can consider the following lexicographic ranking function:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant (x == 1) ? (100 - y) : (100 - z);\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because:\n\n1. When x = 1, the first expression (100 - y) is positive (as y < 100) and decreases (as y increases).\n2. When x = -1, the first expression (100 - z) is positive (as z < 100) and decreases (as z increases).\n\nThus, this lexicographic ranking function proves that the loop terminates.",
            "First, let's identify the variables that are live at the loop head:\n- `y` starts with an unknown value\n- `z` starts with an unknown value\n- `x` can be either 1 or -1\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body and find a ranking function that meets the requirements:\n\n1. The first expression should be positive and decrease with every iteration:\n    - Since `y` and `z` are both increasing or decreasing, we can use the expression `100 - y` as the first expression in the ranking function. This expression is positive while the loop is executing because `y < 100`. It decreases with every iteration when `x` is positive.\n\n2. If the first expression remains constant, the second expression should be positive and decrease with every iteration:\n    - If the first expression remains constant, that means `x` is negative and `y` is not changing. In this case, `z` is increasing. So, we can use the expression `100 - z` as the second expression in the ranking function. This expression is positive while the loop is executing because `z < 100`. It decreases with every iteration when `x` is negative.\n\nThe lexicographic ranking function for this loop is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant 100 - y;\n    loop variant 100 - z;\n*/\n```"

That is, the first expression decreases, or if it remains the same, the second expression decreases, and so on.\nA multi-phase ranking function is a sequence of expressions, where the expressions decrease in phases. That is, the first expression is positive and decreases initially, once it becomes negative, the second expression becomes positive and decreases, and so on.\nGiven a program with a ranking function for the loop in the program, find loop invariants that support the validity of the ranking function and prove the termination of the loop.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make note of the starting values or constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition and the given ranking function.\n- Output loop invariants that are true \n(i) before the loop execution, \n(ii) in every iteration of the loop and \n(iii) after the loop termination, \nsuch that the loop invariants imply that the ranking function decreases with every iteration.\n- If a loop invariant is a conjunction, split it into its parts.\n- Output all the loop invariants in one code block.
