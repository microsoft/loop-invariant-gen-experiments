But when `x` becomes 0, `y` is only decreasing.\n\nSo, the first ranking function is `x` because it is always decreasing or increasing towards 0. After `x` becomes 0, `y` is always decreasing. So, the second ranking function is `y`.\n\nThus, the multi-phase ranking function can be written in ACSL syntax as:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n    loop variant y;\n*/\n```",
            "The live variables at the loop head are `x` and `y`.\n\nThe first expression of the ranking function should be a variable or a combination of variables that definitely decreases with each loop iteration. Looking at the loop body, we can see that `x` decreases with each iteration when it is positive and `y` decreases when `x` is non-positive. \n\nHowever, due to the non-deterministic updates of `x` and `y`, we can't use either of them individually as the first expression. But we can use the sum of `x` and `y` since at least one of them decreases in every iteration, thus the sum definitely decreases.\n\nThe second expression should start decreasing after the first expression becomes non-positive. We can't use `x` or `y` individually due to the same reasons as before. We can use the sum of `x` and `y` again here because it continues decreasing even after it becomes non-positive.\n\nTherefore, the ranking function would be `(x+y, x+y)`. Here is the ACSL representation:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x+y;\n    loop variant x+y;\n*/\n```\n\nThis is a valid ranking function because the first expression definitely decreases with each iteration until it becomes non-positive. After that, the second expression starts decreasing until the loop terminates.",
            "At the start of the loop, the variables live are `x` and `y`.\n\nIn the loop body, `x` and `y` are being modified. \n\nWhen `x` is positive, it's getting decremented by 1. When `x` is negative or zero, it's getting incremented by 1. Therefore, `x` is oscillating around 0. \n\nFor `y`, it's getting decremented by 1 in some iterations, and in others it's getting assigned an unknown value. Hence, y is non-deterministically decreasing.\n\nSo we have two phases:\n- When `x > 0`, `x` is decreasing\n- When `x <= 0`, `y` is non-deterministically decreasing\n\nIn ACSL syntax, the multi-phase ranking function for the loop is:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x when x > 0;\n    loop variant y when x <= 0;\n*/\n```\nThis is a valid ranking function because:\n- When `x > 0`, `x` is definitely decreasing with each loop iteration, hence the loop will terminate.\n- When `x <= 0`, `y` is non-deterministically decreasing, but it can't decrease indefinitely because it's a non-negative integer (an integer can't be less than 0), hence the loop will terminate.",
            "The variables live at the loop head are x and y.\n\nLooking at the loop body, we see that:\n- If x > 0, x is decremented by 1 or y is decremented by 1.\n- If x <= 0, x is incremented by 1 or y is decremented by 1 and x is assigned to an unknown value.\n\nConsidering the first condition in the loop condition (x != 0), we can choose the absolute value of x as the first expression in the ranking function. When x becomes 0, we move on to the next ranking function.\n\nIn both branches of the loop body, y is decremented by 1 or is assigned an unknown value. The condition y > 0 in the loop condition ensures that y is always positive at the start of each loop iteration. Thus, we can choose y as the second expression in our ranking function. Once y becomes non-positive, the loop terminates.\n\nThe ranking function is then:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant |x|;\n    loop variant y;\n*/\n```\n\nThis is a valid multi-phase ranking function because:\n- In the first phase, |x| is always positive and decreases with each loop iteration until it becomes zero.\n- In the second phase, y is always positive and decreases with each loop iteration until it becomes non-positive, at which point the loop terminates.",
            "At the start of the loop, the variables that are live are `x` and `y`.\n\nIn the loop body, `x` decreases when `x` is greater than 0 and some unknown condition is true, otherwise `x` increases when `x` is less than or equal to 0 and the same unknown condition is true. `y` decreases when either `x` is greater than 0 and the unknown condition is false, or `x` is less than or equal to 0 and the unknown condition is false. `y` is also non-deterministically updated when `x` is greater than 0 and the unknown condition is true.\n\nWe see that `x` and `y` are not always decreasing. `x` decreases or increases depending on its value and an unknown condition, and `y` decreases or is non-deterministically updated depending on `x`'s value and an unknown condition. Therefore, we cannot use `x` or `y` as a single-phase ranking function.\n\nHowever, we can use the absolute value of `x` and `y` as a multi-phase ranking function.\n\nThe absolute value of `x` decreases whenever `x` is greater than 0 and the unknown condition is true, so this can be our first expression. \n\nWhen the absolute value of `x` becomes non-positive (i.e., `x` becomes 0), the absolute value of `y` decreases whenever `x` is not greater than 0 and the unknown condition is false. So, the absolute value of `y` can be our second expression.\n\nThis gives us the following ranking function:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant abs(x);\n    loop variant abs(y);\n*/\n```\nThis ranking function is valid because in the first phase, `abs(x)` decreases until `x` becomes 0.
