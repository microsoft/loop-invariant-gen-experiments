The ranking function is \"(n - y, x)\".\n\nNow, we can start formulating the loop invariants:\n\n- Before the loop execution, we have no information about x, y, n, or b as they are assigned non-deterministic values.\n\n- During every iteration of the loop, y is always between 0 and n (inclusive), as the loop condition ensures this. Also, x is always non-negative. These can be expressed as:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= y;\n    loop invariant y <= n;\n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n*/\n```\n- When b = 0, y is incremented by 1 in the loop. When b != 0, y is decremented by 1 and x is decremented by 1 if unknown_int() != 0. It means that the value of y is strictly increased when b = 0, and y and x are strictly decreased when b != 0 and unknown_int() != 0. This condition ensures the lexicographic decrease of the ranking function (n - y, x). We can express this as:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant b == 0 ==> \\at(y, LoopEntry) < y;\n    loop invariant b != 0 && unknown_int() != 0 ==> \\at(y, LoopEntry) > y && \\at(x, LoopEntry) > x;\n*/\n```\n- After the loop termination, y must be either negative or larger than n, and x must be negative.

If `b != 0`, `y` is decreased by 1, and `x` may be decreased by 1 with an unknown probability, while `b` is set to 0.\n\nNow let's find the multi-phase ranking function:\n\n1. The first expression should immediately decrease with every iteration of the loop. In this case, we can choose `x` as our first expression. When `b != 0`, `x` will decrease with each iteration.
