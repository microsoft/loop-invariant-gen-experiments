The second expression (y) is initially any integer value.\n\nNow, let's analyze how x and y change in each iteration:\n\n1. If y is negative, then x decreases in the next iteration (x = x + y, y < 0). In this case, x is a valid ranking function, as it is positive and decreases.\n2. If y is non-negative, then x increases in the next iteration (x = x + y, y >= 0).

Since y can be positive, negative, or zero, we cannot guarantee that x will always decrease.\n\nTherefore, we need to find another expression e2 that decreases when e1 remains the same.\n\nLet's consider e2 = |y|, the absolute value of y. Since x = x + y in the loop body, if x remains the same, it means that y = 0.

This is because when `x > 0` and `y < 0`, `x` will decrease; when `y > 0`, `x` will increase, but since `y` will be negated and decreased by 1 in the next step, it will ensure that `x` decreases in the next iteration. The loop terminates when `x` becomes non-positive.\n\n2. The second expression, `y >= 0 ? y : -y - 1`, is the absolute value of `y + 1`. This expression is positive and decreases because `y` is negated and decreased by 1 in each iteration. When `y` is positive, this expression will decrease, and when `y` is negative, this expression will also decrease due to the negation and subtraction.\n\nSo, the lexicographic ranking function for this loop is `(x, y >= 0 ? y : -y - 1)`.\n\nIn ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n    loop variant y >= 0 ? y : -y - 1;\n*/\n```",

So, if y was negative in the previous iteration, x decreases and y increases in the next iteration.\n\n- Similarly, in every iteration, x increases if y is positive and y becomes negative in the next iteration. So, if y was positive in the previous iteration, x increases and y decreases in the next iteration.\n\n- But since the loop continues only when x > 0, when x starts increasing (when y is positive), the loop will terminate as x will eventually become less than or equal to 0. This is our second loop invariant.\n\nSo, the loop invariants are:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x > 0;\n    loop invariant \\at(y, LoopEntry) < 0 ==> x < \\at(x, LoopEntry) && y > \\at(y, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant \\at(y, LoopEntry) > 0 ==> x > \\at(x, LoopEntry) && y < \\at(y, LoopEntry);\n*/\n```\n\nThese invariants, along with the loop condition, ensure that the lexicographic ranking function (x, y) decreases in every iteration, which proves the termination of the loop.",
                    "Let's start with the initial conditions before the loop. We have two variables, x and y, whose values are unknown at the start of the program. So, we don't have any invariants that hold before the loop.\n\nInside the loop, x is updated as x + y and y is updated as -y - 1. The loop continues as long as x > 0.\n\nWe are given a lexicographic ranking function (x, y). This means that x decreases in every iteration, or if it stays the same, then y decreases.\n\nLet's think about the invariants that hold during the loop execution.\n\n1. In the first iteration, y is updated as -y - 1, which means that y is always decreasing in every iteration. We can write this as a loop invariant:\n\n    `/*@ loop invariant \\at(y, LoopEntry) > y; */`\n\n2. As for x, it is updated as x + y. This means that x will decrease if y is negative. From the loop condition, we know that x > 0. Thus, if x stays the same or decreases, y must be negative. We can write this as a loop invariant:\n\n    `/*@ loop invariant \\at(x, LoopEntry) >= x ==> y < 0; */`\n\n3. Also, if x decreases, y could be positive or negative. If y is positive, x + y would be greater than x, contradicting that x decreases. Therefore, y must be negative when x decreases. We can write this as a loop invariant:\n\n    `/*@ loop invariant \\at(x, LoopEntry) > x ==> y < 0; */`\n\nAfter the loop, we know that x must be less than or equal to 0. This is because the loop condition is x > 0, and once this condition is false, the loop will terminate.\n\nNow, let's put all the loop invariants together:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant \\at(y, LoopEntry) > y;\n    loop invariant \\at(x, LoopEntry) >= x ==> y < 0;\n    loop invariant \\at(x, LoopEntry) > x ==> y < 0;\n*/\n```",

Also, in the first iteration, `y` becomes negative if it was positive or zero initially. Thus, `x` and `y` can both be a part of the ranking function.\n\nIn subsequent iterations, `x` continues to decrease if `y` is negative. However, `y` switches its sign and decreases by 1 in magnitude with every iteration. So, after a certain number of iterations, `y` would become negative and `x` will start increasing. This is where the multi-phase ranking function comes into play.\n\nThe first ranking function could be `x` itself as it decreases initially. Once `x` becomes non-positive, we need to switch to the second ranking function.
