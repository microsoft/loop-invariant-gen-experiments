            "The loop in the given program is controlled by three variables: `x`, `y`, and `z`. Any of these variables can decrease in an iteration, and none of them is guaranteed to decrease in every iteration because there are conditions that can prevent them from decreasing. \n\nWe can see that `x`, `y`, and `z` are all non-negative integers because they decrease by 1 in every iteration and the loop condition checks that they are all positive. Therefore, we can define a ranking function as the sum of `x`, `y`, and `z`. This function is positive because all three variables are positive, and it decreases with every iteration because at least one of the variables decreases in every iteration.\n\nSo the ranking function is `x + y + z`.\n\nWe can express this in ACSL syntax as follows:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x + y + z;\n*/\n```",
            "The values of x, y, and z are live at the loop head. They start with arbitrary values and decrease with each iteration of the loop. The loop terminates when any of them becomes non-positive.\n\nThe ranking function for this loop could be x + y + z. This is a valid ranking function because it decreases with every iteration of the loop (since at least one of x, y, or z is decremented in each iteration) and it is positive while the loop is executing (since the loop continues as long as x, y, and z are all positive).\n\nIn ACSL syntax, the ranking function is:\n\n```c\n/*@\n    loop variant x + y + z;\n*/\n```",
            "The variables `x`, `y`, and `z` are live at the head of the loop. They are initially assigned to `unknown_int()`, which is not defined in the program. Therefore, there are no constraints on their starting values.\n\nLooking at the body of the loop, the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` are all decremented in different branches of the `if-else` statements. In each iteration of the loop, at least one of the variables is decremented by 1, and the other variables may be assigned to `unknown_int()`.\n\nBecause the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` can change unpredictably due to the assignments to `unknown_int()`, a single ranking function based on one variable cannot be defined. Instead, a ranking function based on the sum of the variables can be used. The sum `x + y + z` is guaranteed to decrease in each iteration because at least one variable is decremented and no variable is incremented. The sum is also positive as long as the loop continues executing because `x > 0`, `y > 0`, and `z > 0` are part of the loop condition.\n\nTherefore, the ranking function is `x + y + z`.\n\n```c\n/*@ \n    loop variant x + y + z;\n*/\n```\nThis is a valid ranking function because it is decreased in every iteration of the loop and remains positive as long as the loop continues executing.",
            "The variables that are live at the loop head are `x`, `y`, and `z`. All of these variables are initially assigned to unknown values from the `unknown_int()` function, and they are all decremented by 1 at some point during the loop.\n\nAs the loop continues to execute as long as `x`, `y`, and `z` are all positive, we can say that the maximum of these three variables is a valid ranking function. This is because in every iteration, at least one of these variables is decremented by 1, which means the maximum value decreases with every iteration.\n\nA positive value of the ranking function is ensured because the loop continues to execute as long as `x`, `y`, and `z` are all positive. \n\nSo we have:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant max(x, max(y, z));\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because it decreases with each iteration and remains positive as long as the loop continues to execute.",

If the first `unknown_int()` is 0 and the second `unknown_int()` is not 0, then y is decremented by 1 and z gets a new unknown value.\n3. If both `unknown_int()` are 0, then z is decremented by 1 and x gets a new unknown value.\n\nFrom the loop body analysis, we can see that the loop terminates when x, y, or z are no longer positive.
