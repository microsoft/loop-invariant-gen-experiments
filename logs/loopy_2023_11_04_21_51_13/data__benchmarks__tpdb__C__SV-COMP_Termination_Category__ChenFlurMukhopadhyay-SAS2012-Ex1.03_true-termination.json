It decreases with every iteration, because `x` is assigned a new value in every iteration that is half of its previous value, so `2 - x` increases.\n2. It is always positive, because the loop condition `x > 1` ensures that `x` is always less than or equal to 2.\n\nTherefore, the ranking function `2 - x` ensures the termination of the loop.\n\nHere is the code block with the loop variant:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant 2 - x;\n*/\n```",

If this is true, the loop breaks.\n\nHowever, since we don't know what `unknown_int()` does, we can't predict how `x` will change in each iteration. This means we can't find a ranking function that guarantees the loop will terminate. \n\nThe loop invariant here would be that `x` is always greater than 1 for the loop to execute and that `-2 * x` is always equal to `old_x`.

This means that `x` is decreasing in every iteration and in order for the loop to continue executing, `-2*x` must be equal to `old_x`.\n\nThe value of `x` is unknown, but it is decreasing in every iteration of the loop.

Then there's a conditional check `if (-2*x != old_x)`.

                    "At the start of the loop, we know that `x` is an integer, but we don't know its specific value. The loop condition is `x > 1`, and the loop variant is `x`. It is also given that `x` is assigned a new value from `unknown_int()` in each iteration of the loop, and the loop breaks if `-2*x` is not equal to `old_x`. \n\nFrom these, we can derive the following loop invariants:\n\n(i) Before the loop execution:\n- `x` is an integer.\n\n(ii) In every iteration of the loop:\n- `x` is always greater than 1, because the loop condition is `x > 1`.\n- If `-2*x` is equal to `old_x`, then `x` is non-negative.\n\n(iii) After the loop termination:\n- `x` is less than or equal to 1, because the loop terminates when `x <= 1`.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants that support the validity of the ranking function and prove the termination of the loop are:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x > 1;\n    loop invariant -2*x == \\at(old_x, LoopEntry) ==> x >= 0;\n*/\n```\n\nThe first invariant suggests that `x` is always greater than 1 during the loop execution, which ensures that the loop variant `x` is non-negative.

The ranking function is intended to decrease with every iteration of the loop.\n\nLet's find loop invariants that support the validity of the ranking function.\n\n(i) Before the loop execution: \nSince **x** is initialized with an unknown integer value, we can't make any assumptions about its initial value. \n\n(ii) In every iteration of the loop: \nThe loop continues as long as **x > 1**. The value of **x** is replaced with an unknown integer value in every iteration. If the new value of **x** does not satisfy the condition **-2*x == old_x**, the loop breaks.
