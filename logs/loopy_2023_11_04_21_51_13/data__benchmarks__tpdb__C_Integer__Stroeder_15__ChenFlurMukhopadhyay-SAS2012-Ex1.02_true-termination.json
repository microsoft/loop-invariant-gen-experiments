We also know that `x` must be less than 100.

The loop has the following conditions:\n1. `x > 0`\n2. `x < 100`\n3. `x >= 2 * oldx + 10`\n\nWe can see that `x` must be greater than or equal to `2 * oldx + 10` and also less than 100. With every iteration, `x` is updated to a new unknown value. Since the loop continues executing if `x >= 2 * oldx + 10`, we can assume that `x` does not decrease during the loop. \n\nNow, we can write a ranking function that involves the upper bound (100) and the old value of `x`:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant 100 - oldx;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because:\n1. It is a positive value while the loop is executing: `100 - oldx > 0` as `x < 100`.\n2.

The loop condition is `x > 0 && x < 100 && x >= 2 * oldx + 10`.\n\nNext, let's analyze the loop body. The loop body consists of updating `oldx` with the value of `x`, and then assigning a new value to `x`. Since `x` is an unknown integer, we don't have a specific function for how it changes with each iteration.\n\nHowever, we do know that `x` must be greater than or equal to `2 * oldx + 10` and less than 100 for the loop to continue executing. This means that with each iteration, the value of `x` is getting closer to the upper bound of 100.\n\nBased on this information, a potential ranking function could be `100 - x`. This expression decreases with each iteration of the loop, as `x` increases, and it is positive as long as `x` is less than 100. Here's the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant 100 - x;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because it satisfies the two conditions: it is decreasing with every iteration of the loop (since `x` is increasing), and it is positive while the loop is executing (as `x` must be less than 100 for the loop to continue).",

The loop continues if `x > 0`, `x < 100`, and `x >= 2 * oldx + 10`.\n2. In each iteration of the loop, `oldx` is assigned the value of `x`, and `x` is assigned a new unknown integer value from the `unknown_int()` function.\n\nSince the loop condition requires `x` to not decrease, and there is an upper bound of `100` for `x`, we can create a ranking function based on the difference between the upper bound and the old value of `x`.\n\nThe ranking function for the given loop is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant 100 - oldx;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because it is decreasing with every iteration of the loop, as `x` is always greater than `2 * oldx + 10`, and the loop condition ensures that `x < 100`. Additionally, the ranking function evaluates to a positive value while the loop is executing, since the loop condition requires `x > 0`.",

As per the loop condition, \"oldx\" is always less than or equal to \"x / 2 - 5\" (derived from \"x >= 2*oldx + 10\").\n\n(iii) After the loop termination: The loop terminates when \"x\" becomes less than or equal to 0 or \"x\" becomes greater than or equal to 100 or \"x\" becomes less than \"2*oldx + 10\". \n\nLet's write these observations as loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant oldx >= 0;\n    loop invariant oldx < 100;\n    loop invariant oldx <= x/2 - 5;\n*/\n```\n\nThese loop invariants imply that the ranking function **(100 - oldx)** is non-negative and strictly decreases with every iteration of the loop, hence proving the termination of the loop.",
