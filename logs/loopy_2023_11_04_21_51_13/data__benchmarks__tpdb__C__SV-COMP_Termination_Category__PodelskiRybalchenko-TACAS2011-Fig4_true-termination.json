We do not know the new value of `y`, but we do know that `x` decreases.\n- If `unknown_int()` returns zero, `y` is decreased by 1. In this case, `x` remains the same, but `y` decreases.\n\nSo, we can see that at least one of `x` or `y` decreases with each iteration of the loop. This leads us to a lexicographic ranking function `(x, y)`.\n\nHere's why it's a valid ranking function:\n\n- `x` is always positive inside the loop and decreases whenever `unknown_int()` returns a non-zero value.\n- When `x` remains the same, `y` is positive and decreases.\n\nThus, the ranking function proves that the loop terminates, as at least one of `x` or `y` decreases with every iteration, and both are positive inside the loop.\n\nThe lexicographic ranking function in ACSL syntax would look like this:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n    loop variant y;\n*/\n```",

The first expression `x` is positive and decreases when the first branch of the `if` statement is taken. If `x` remains the same, the second expression `y` is positive and decreases when the second branch of the `if` statement is taken.\n\nThe function is valid because in every iteration of the loop, either `x` decreases, or `x` remains the same and `y` decreases.

Thus, we can say that the lexicographic ranking function is `(x, y)`.\n\nThe first expression in the ranking function, `x`, is positive and decreases in some iterations of the loop.
