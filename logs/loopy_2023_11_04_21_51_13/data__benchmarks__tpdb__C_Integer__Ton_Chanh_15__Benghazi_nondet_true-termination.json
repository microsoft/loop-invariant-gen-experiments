Hence, **d1old** is always less than or equal to **d2** and **d1**.\n- We know that **d1** and **d2** are both non-negative before the loop execution, because they are the return value of **unknown_int()** function, which is non-deterministic but we assume that it returns non-negative integers.\n- We know that **d1** and **d2** remain non-negative throughout the loop execution, because they are always replaced by positive values.\n- We know that **x** is non-negative before the loop execution, because it is the return value of **unknown_int()** function, which is non-deterministic but we assume that it returns non-negative integers.\n- We know that **x** remains non-negative throughout the loop execution, because it is always decreased by a non-negative value **d1**.\n- We know that **(x + d1 + d2)** is non-negative before the loop execution, because **x**, **d1**, and **d2** are all non-negative.\n- We know that **(x + d1 + d2)** decreases in every loop iteration, because **x** is decreased by **d1** and **d1** and **d2** are replaced by values that are less than or equal to their old values.

We have to consider the invariants that hold before the loop, during the loop, and after the loop.\n\nBefore the loop, x, d1, and d2 are non-negative. This is because x is checked against zero in the loop condition and d1 and d2 are incremented in the loop body.\n\nDuring the loop, x is decreased by d1 and d1, d2 are incremented. Therefore, the sum (x + d1 + d2) decreases in each iteration.\n\nAfter the loop, x is negative.

To find an expression that decreases when x is non-positive, we can use the difference between d1 and d2.\n\nLet's consider the difference d1 - d2. When x is non-positive, d1 and d2 have already been updated in the loop. So, the difference d1 - d2 will be decreasing in this case.\n\nNow we can write the multi-phase ranking function using the two expressions we found.\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n    loop variant d1 - d2;\n*/\n```\n\nThis multi-phase ranking function is valid because:\n1. x decreases with every iteration of the loop.\n2. When x becomes non-positive, the difference d1 - d2 starts decreasing, which ensures that the loop eventually terminates."

This means that `x` should decrease in every iteration, or if it remains the same, `d1 - d2` should decrease.\n\nGiven this information, we can derive the following loop invariants:\n\n- `x` is always non-negative at the start of the loop. This is because the loop continues as long as `x >= 0`.\n- `d1` is always greater than `d2` at the end of each iteration. This is because `d1` is assigned `d2 + 1` in each iteration.\n- `x` is always decreasing in every iteration. This is because `x` is decreased by `d1` in each iteration.\n- `d1` and `d2` are always increasing in every iteration. This is because `d1` is assigned `d2 + 1` and `d2` is assigned `d1old + 1` in each iteration.\n\nThese invariants can be written in ACSL as follows:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant d1 > d2;\n    loop invariant x <= \\at(x, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant d1 >= \\at(d1, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant d2 >= \\at(d2, LoopEntry);\n*/\n```\n\nThese loop invariants imply that the ranking function `(x, d1 - d2)` decreases with every iteration, which proves the termination of the loop.",
                    "In this program, the variables `x`, `d1`, `d2`, and `d1old` are live at the loop head. The loop continues while `x` is greater or equal to zero. The ranking function provided is `(x, d1 - d2)`.\n\nLet's analyze the loop body and the ranking function. `x` is decremented by `d1` in each iteration. `d1` and `d2` are updated in every iteration such that `d1` is equal to `d2 + 1` and `d2` is equal to `d1old + 1`. The ranking function `(x, d1 - d2)` is a lexicographic ranking function: `x` decreases, or if it remains the same, `d1 - d2` decreases.\n\nFrom this, we can infer the following loop invariants:\n\n1. `x` is always non-negative at the beginning of each iteration. This is true because the loop continues while `x` is greater or equal to zero. This implies that `x` is non-negative at the end of the loop as well.\n\n2. `d1 - d2` is always non-negative at the beginning of each iteration. This is true because `d1` is always equal to `d2 + 1` at the beginning of each iteration.\n\n3. `d1 - d2` is always strictly decreasing in each iteration. This is true because `d1` is always equal to `d2 + 1` at the beginning of each iteration, and `d2` is always equal to `d1old + 1` at the end of each iteration.\n\n4. `d1` is always greater than `d2` at the beginning of each iteration. This is true because `d1` is always equal to `d2 + 1` at the beginning of each iteration.\n\nThese loop invariants can be expressed in ACSL as follows:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant d1 - d2 >= 0;\n    loop invariant d1 - \\at(d2, LoopEntry) == 1;\n    loop invariant d1 > d2;\n*/\n```",
                    "The loop we are dealing with here is:\n```\n\twhile (x >= 0) {\n\t\tx = x - d1;\n\t\td1old = d1;\n\t\td1 = d2 + 1;\n\t\td2 = d1old + 1;\n\t}\n```\nThe ranking function given is (x, d1 - d2), which means it's a lexicographic ranking function with two expressions x and d1 - d2.\n\nBefore the loop execution, x, d1 and d2 can be any integer value since they are assigned the return value of unknown_int(). \n\nNow, let's think about the loop invariants that are true before the loop execution, during every iteration, and after the loop termination.\n\nThe following loop invariants can be derived:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant \\at(x, LoopEntry) >= x;\n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant d1 >= d2;\n    loop invariant \\at(d1, LoopEntry) + 1 == d2;\n*/\n```\n\nHere is the explanation of each loop invariant:\n\n- `\\at(x, LoopEntry) >= x;` : This invariant states that the value of 'x' at the loop entry is always greater than or equal to the current value of 'x'. This means 'x' is either decreasing or remaining the same with each iteration of the loop.\n\n- `x >= 0;` : This invariant states that 'x' is always greater than or equal to 0. This is because the loop condition is 'x >= 0'.\n\n- `d1 >= d2;` : This invariant states that 'd1' is always greater than or equal to 'd2'. This is because in each iteration, 'd1' is assigned the value of 'd2 + 1' and 'd2' is assigned the value of 'd1old + 1' where 'd1old' is the previous value of 'd1'. Since 'd1' always has a higher or same value than 'd1old', 'd1' is always greater than or equal to 'd2'.\n\n- `\\at(d1, LoopEntry) + 1 == d2;` : This invariant states that the value of 'd2' at the loop entry is always equal to the current value of 'd1 + 1'. This is because in each iteration, 'd2' is assigned the value of 'd1old + 1' and 'd1old' is the previous value of 'd1'. \n\nThese loop invariants prove that the ranking function (x, d1 - d2) decreases with every iteration, which means that the loop terminates.",
                    "The loop invariants for the above program would be:\n\n```c\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant d1 >= 0;\n    loop invariant d2 >= 0;\n    loop invariant d1 >= d2 + 1;\n    loop invariant d1 <= \\at(d1, LoopEntry) + 1;\n    loop invariant d2 <= \\at(d1, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant x >= d1;\n    loop invariant x <= \\at(x, LoopEntry) + d1;\n*/\n```\nThese invariants hold true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination, and they support the validity of the ranking function (x, d1 - d2). \n\n- The first invariant asserts that `x` is always non-negative at the beginning of the loop.\n- The second and third invariants assert that `d1` and `d2` are always non-negative at the beginning of the loop.\n- The fourth invariant asserts that `d1` is always greater than or equal to `d2 + 1` at the beginning of the loop.\n- The fifth invariant asserts that the new value of `d1` is always less than or equal to the old value of `d1` plus 1.\n- The sixth invariant asserts that `d2` is always less than or equal to the old value of `d1`.\n- The seventh invariant asserts that `x` is always greater than or equal to `d1` at the beginning of the loop.\n- The eighth invariant asserts that the new value of `x` is always less than or equal to the old value of `x` plus `d1`.\n\nAll these invariants together imply that the ranking function (x, d1 - d2) decreases with every iteration of the loop, thereby proving the loop's termination."
