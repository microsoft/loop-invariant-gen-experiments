This invariant holds because y is incremented by z, and z is decremented by 1 in each iteration, so the sum of y and z never decreases below the initial value of y.\n\nThese loop invariants support the lexicographic ranking function (x, y) and imply that the ranking function decreases with every iteration of the loop, proving the termination of the loop.",

So, once `x` becomes non-positive, `y` will start decreasing.\n\n- For the third expression, `z` decreases in every iteration of the loop, so `z` is a valid third expression for the ranking function.\n\nSo, the multi-phase ranking function for this loop is `(x, y, z)` and it is valid because `x` decreases first, then `y` decreases when `x` becomes non-positive, and finally `z` decreases till the loop terminates.\n\nIn ACSL syntax, we have:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n    loop variant y;\n    loop variant z;\n*/\n```",

We see that `z` is decreased in every iteration of the loop: `z = z - 1`. So, `z` is a candidate for the first expression in our ranking function.\n\nNext, we need to find an expression that decreases once the first expression becomes zero or negative. When `z` becomes non-positive, `y` is updated as `y = y + z` and since `z` is non-positive, `y` decreases. So, `y` is a candidate for the second expression in our ranking function.\n\nFinally, once `y` becomes non-positive, `x` is updated as `x = x + y` and since `y` is non-positive, `x` decreases.

And `z` is decremented in each loop iteration. This makes it a bit tricky to find an expression that decreases with every iteration of the loop, as the values of `x`, `y` and `z` are interdependent.\n\nHowever, if we look at the updates to `x` and `y`, we see that they are always increasing (as `y` and `z` are always non-negative at the beginning of each loop iteration). So, we can't use `x` or `y` as the first expression in our ranking function, as they don't decrease with each loop iteration.\n\nOn the other hand, `z` is always decremented in each loop iteration, so it is always decreasing.
