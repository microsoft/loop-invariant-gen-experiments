In this case, the variables are `x` and `y`, and both are assigned by `unknown_int()`, so we don't have specific constraints on their initial values.\n\nNow let's analyze the loop body:\n1. `x = x + y;`\n2. `y = y - 1;`\n\nThe loop condition is `x > 0`. We need to find a lexicographic ranking function such that the expressions decrease with every iteration of the loop and evaluate to positive values while the loop is executing.\n\nFor the first expression, we can use `x` itself, since it is positive while the loop is executing. We know that `x` decreases when `y` is negative. So, for the second expression, we can use `-y`, which will be positive when `y` is negative.\n\nNow let's see if these expressions form a valid lexicographic ranking function:\n1. When `y` is negative, `x` decreases with every iteration, and the loop will eventually terminate when `x` becomes non-positive.\n2. When `y` is non-negative, `-y` is non-positive, but since `x` is positive in the loop condition, the first expression ensures that the loop will eventually terminate.\n\nThus, the lexicographic ranking function is `(x, -y)`.\n\nIn ACSL syntax, the ranking function can be written as:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n    loop variant -y;\n*/\n```",

Find a lexicographic ranking function:\n\n   - The first expression should involve x, as it is the loop condition variable (x > 0).\n   - Since x is updated as x = x + y, it may either increase or decrease based on the value of y.\n   - To find a ranking function that always decreases, we can consider the case when y is positive, and x keeps decreasing until x <= 0.\n   \n   - Let's consider the first expression as x.\n\n   - Now we need to find a second expression that decreases when the first expression remains the same.\n   - Since y is always decreasing (y = y - 1), we can choose the second expression as y.\n   \n   - The lexicographic ranking function is (x, y).\n\n4.

Therefore, at termination, `x` must be less than or equal to 0.\n\nAll these invariants can be summarized as follows:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant \\forall int i; 0 <= i < \\at(x, LoopEntry) ==> \\at(x, LoopEntry) + \\at(y, LoopEntry) - i == x + y;\n    loop invariant y <= \\at(y, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant x <= \\at(x, LoopEntry) + \\at(y, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant y >= -\\at(x, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant x + y >= 0;\n*/\n```\nThe first invariant implies that in every iteration, the sum of `x` and `y` decreases by exactly 1.

The fourth invariant bounds `y` from below by the negative of the initial value of `x`. The final invariant implies that the sum of `x` and `y` is always non-negative.

This is because `y` is decreased by 1 in each loop iteration.\n\nPutting these together, we can express the loop invariants as follows:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant y <= 0;\n    loop invariant x <= \\at(x, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant -y <= \\at(-y, LoopEntry);\n*/\n```\n\nThese loop invariants imply that the ranking function `(x, -y)` decreases with every iteration, proving the termination of the loop.",
