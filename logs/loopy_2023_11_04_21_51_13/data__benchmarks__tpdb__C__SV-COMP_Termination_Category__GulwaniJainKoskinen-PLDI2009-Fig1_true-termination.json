            "First, let's analyze the variables that are live at the loop head. In this case, `tmp` is the only variable that changes during the loop execution. The loop continues as long as `tmp != id` and `unknown_int()` returns a non-zero value. We cannot control the return value of `unknown_int()`, so we focus on the relation between `tmp` and `id`.\n\nAt the beginning of the loop, `tmp = id + 1`. During the loop, `tmp` increases by 1 if `tmp <= maxId` and resets to 0 if `tmp > maxId`. Therefore, `tmp` is always in the range `[0, maxId + 1]`.\n\nThe ranking function we are looking for should involve `tmp` and decrease with every iteration of the loop. Since `tmp` increases by 1 in each iteration, we should use an expression that involves the upper bound `maxId`. We can use the following ranking function:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant maxId + 1 - tmp;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because:\n\n1. It is positive when the loop is executing: Since `tmp` is in the range `[0, maxId + 1]`, `maxId + 1 - tmp` is in the range `[0, maxId + 1]`. Therefore, it is always positive.\n\n2. It decreases with every iteration of the loop: In each iteration, `tmp` increases by 1 or resets to 0, so `maxId + 1 - tmp` decreases by 1 or remains unchanged. However, when `tmp` resets to 0, it means that `tmp > maxId` in the previous iteration, and now `tmp = 0`. So, the value of the ranking function becomes `maxId + 1`, which is smaller than the previous value `maxId + 1 - (maxId + 1) = 0`. Therefore, the ranking function decreases with every iteration of the loop.\n\nIn conclusion, the ranking function `maxId + 1 - tmp` is a valid ranking function for the given loop.",

If `tmp <= maxId`, then `tmp` is incremented by 1.\n2. If `tmp > maxId`, then `tmp` is reset to 0.\n\nSince `tmp` can only increase in the loop, we can use the difference between the upper bound `maxId` and the loop variable `tmp` as our ranking function. The ranking function should decrease with each iteration and be positive as long as the loop continues.\n\nThe ranking function is `maxId - tmp`.

            "Firstly, the variables alive at the loop head are `tmp` and `id`. \n\nThe value of `tmp` varies within the loop, and can either be incremented by 1 if it's less than or equal to `maxId` or be reset to 0 if it's greater than `maxId`. The value of `id` is constant within the loop.\n\nA valid lexicographic ranking function for this loop could be `(maxId - tmp + 1, id)`.\n\nHere's why:\n- `maxId - tmp + 1` is always positive because `tmp` is always less than or equal to `maxId`. This expression decreases whenever `tmp` is incremented.\n- If `maxId - tmp + 1` stays the same (which happens when `tmp` is reset to 0), `id` is a constant positive value that can serve as the second expression in the lexicographic ranking function.\n\nTherefore, we can say that the lexicographic ranking function is valid because it guarantees the termination of the loop. The first expression in the function decreases with every loop iteration until it reaches 0, at which point `tmp` is reset to 0. After that, `id` can serve as the second expression in the lexicographic ranking function, ensuring that the loop terminates.\n\nHere's the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant maxId - tmp + 1;\n    loop variant id;\n*/\n```",
            "The loop in the program is:\n```\nwhile(tmp!=id && unknown_int()) {\n    if (tmp <= maxId) {\n        tmp = tmp + 1;\n    } else {\n        tmp = 0;\n    }\n}\n```\nThe loop condition is `tmp!=id && unknown_int()`. So, the loop continues as long as `tmp` is not equal to `id` and `unknown_int()` does not return 0.\n\nThe variable `tmp` is live at the loop head. The variable `tmp` is initialized as `id+1` before the loop starts and it gets updated in each iteration of the loop.\n\nThe variable `tmp` can increase by 1 if `tmp` is less than or equal to `maxId`. Otherwise, `tmp` is reset to 0.\n\nConsidering these conditions, we can construct a lexicographic ranking function for the loop as `(maxId - tmp, tmp)`. Here:\n\n- `maxId - tmp` is a valid ranking function because `tmp` is less than or equal to `maxId` (as per the `if` condition inside the loop) and `tmp` increases by 1 in every iteration when `tmp <= maxId`. So, `maxId - tmp` is positive and decreases in every iteration when `tmp` is less than or equal to `maxId`.\n\n- `tmp` is a valid ranking function because `tmp` decreases from `maxId` to 0 when `tmp > maxId`.\n\nTherefore, the lexicographic ranking function is:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant maxId - tmp;\n    loop variant tmp;\n*/\n```",

            "The loop in the program is controlled by two conditions: `tmp != id` and `unknown_int()`. The latter is a non-deterministic function which we cannot control or predict. Therefore, we focus on the former condition `tmp != id`.\n\nThe value of `tmp` is updated in each iteration of the loop, either by incrementing `tmp` or resetting it to 0.\n\nThe loop variant here is `maxId - tmp` for the following reasons:\n\n- It is positive: Since `tmp` is always less than or equal to `maxId`, `maxId - tmp` is always non-negative. Also, because the loop condition is `tmp != id` and `id < maxId`, `tmp` cannot be equal to `maxId` when the loop is executing. Therefore, `maxId - tmp` is always positive during the execution of the loop.\n- It decreases: In each iteration of the loop, `tmp` is either incremented or reset to 0. When `tmp` is incremented, `maxId - tmp` decreases. When `tmp` is reset to 0, `maxId - tmp` is reset to `maxId` which is less than the previous value of `maxId - tmp` (which must be less than `maxId` because `tmp` was incremented in the previous iteration).\n\nSo, the lexicographic ranking function is `(maxId - tmp)`.\n\nHere is the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```c\n/*@\n    loop variant maxId - tmp;\n*/\n```",
            "At the start of the loop, the variable `tmp` is assigned the value of `id + 1`. In each iteration of the loop, `tmp` is either increased by `1` or reset to `0`. Therefore, `tmp` always lies in the range `[0, maxId + 1]`.\n\nThe loop continues as long as `tmp` is not equal to `id` and `unknown_int()` returns a non-zero value. Since `unknown_int()` could return any integer, it is not possible to define a ranking function based on its return value. However, we can define a ranking function based on the difference between `maxId` and `tmp`.\n\nIf `tmp <= maxId`, then `tmp` is increased by `1`, and the difference `maxId - tmp` decreases. If `tmp > maxId`, then `tmp` is reset to `0`, and the difference `maxId - tmp` is `maxId`, which is greater than the difference in the previous iteration.\n\nTherefore, a possible ranking function is `(maxId + 1 - tmp, tmp)`. The first expression is always positive and decreases when `tmp` is incremented. If the first expression remains the same (which happens when `tmp` is reset to `0`), the second expression (`tmp`) is positive and decreases.\n\nThe ranking function in ACSL syntax would be:\n\n```c\n/*@\n    loop variant maxId + 1 - tmp;\n    loop variant tmp;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function provides a measure of the \"progress\" of the loop, decreasing in each iteration and ensuring termination."

The value of `tmp` is deterministically updated in the loop.\n\nIn the first iteration of the loop, the value of `tmp` is increased by 1 if `tmp` is less than or equal to `maxId`. If `tmp` is greater than `maxId`, it is set to 0. \n\nIn the second iteration of the loop, the same process is repeated for the updated value of `tmp`. \n\nThis process continues until `tmp` is equal to `id`.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that `tmp` is the variable that decreases in the first phase of the loop until it becomes non-positive. \n\nIn the second phase of the loop, when `tmp` becomes non-positive, the loop terminates because the condition `tmp != id` in the while loop is no longer satisfied. \n\nThus, the multi-phase ranking function is `(maxId - tmp)`, which is the difference between `maxId` and `tmp`. This function decreases with every iteration of the loop until it becomes non-positive, at which point the loop terminates.\n\nTherefore, the valid ranking function in ACSL syntax is:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant maxId - tmp;\n*/\n```",
            "The variables that are live at the head of the loop are `id`, `maxId`, and `tmp`.\n\nThe loop condition is `tmp!=id && unknown_int()`. The `unknown_int()` function introduces non-determinism, which means it can return any integer value. However, we don't need to consider `unknown_int()` in our ranking function, as it does not affect the termination of the loop - the loop can still terminate regardless of what `unknown_int()` returns.\n\nThe first part of the loop condition, `tmp!=id`, gives us a hint for a possible ranking function. When `tmp` equals `id`, the loop will terminate. Therefore, the absolute difference between `tmp` and `id` can serve as a ranking function, as it decreases with each iteration until it becomes zero, at which point the loop terminates.\n\nIn the loop body, `tmp` is either incremented by 1 or reset to 0. This suggests that we can use `maxId - tmp` as another ranking function. When `tmp <= maxId`, this expression decreases as `tmp` increases. When `tmp` is reset to 0, this expression becomes `maxId`, which is non-negative and doesn't increase.\n\nHowever, we must be careful about the order of these ranking functions. The expression `maxId - tmp` only starts decreasing once `tmp` has reached `maxId`, at which point `tmp - id` has already become non-positive. Therefore, `tmp - id` should be our first ranking function, and `maxId - tmp` should be our second ranking function.\n\nTo express the absolute difference between `tmp` and `id`, we use the ternary operator to describe the absolute value of an expression: `tmp>=id ? tmp-id : id-tmp`.\n\nPutting it all together, we get the multi-phase ranking function:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant tmp>=id ? tmp-id : id-tmp;\n    loop variant maxId - tmp;\n*/\n```",
            "1. Let's identify the variables that are live at the loop head. In this case, the variables are `tmp`, `id`, and `maxId`. \n\n2. We notice that `tmp` gets updated in the loop and `id` and `maxId` remain constant.\n\n3. The loop termination condition is `tmp != id`. \n\n4. We need to find the expressions that decrease with every iteration of the loop until the loop terminates. \n\n5. The first expression in the multi-phase ranking function should be the one that decreases with every iteration of the loop. In this loop, `tmp` is the variable that changes. \n\n6. The expression `maxId - tmp` decreases as `tmp` increases. We will use this as the first expression in our multi-phase ranking function.\n\n7. When `tmp` becomes greater than `maxId`, `tmp` is set to `0`. At this point, the first expression `maxId - tmp` becomes non-positive.\n\n8. The second expression in our ranking function should be the one that starts decreasing once the first expression becomes non-positive. At the point when `tmp` is set to `0`, it starts increasing again until it equals `id`. So, the expression `id - tmp` starts decreasing at this point.\n\n9. Once `tmp` becomes equal to `id`, the loop terminates.\n\n10. Thus, the multi-phase ranking function for this loop is `(maxId - tmp, id - tmp)`. This function is valid because each expression decreases until it becomes non-positive, at which point the next expression starts decreasing. When the last expression becomes non-positive, the loop terminates.\n\nThe ranking function in ACSL syntax is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant maxId - tmp;\n    loop variant id - tmp;\n*/\n```",

The starting values or constraints for these variables are as follows:\n- `tmp` is initialized as `id+1`.\n- `id` is a non-negative integer and less than `maxId`.\n- `maxId` is an externally provided integer and is greater than `id`.\n\nThe loop body consists of an if-else statement. If `tmp` is less than or equal to `maxId`, it increments `tmp` by 1. Otherwise, it resets `tmp` to 0.\n\nFor the first expression in the ranking function, we should choose an expression that immediately decreases with every iteration of the loop. Here, `maxId - tmp` can be a valid first ranking function because it immediately decreases when `tmp` is incremented and becomes non-positive when `tmp` reaches `maxId`.\n\nFor the second expression, we need to find an expression that decreases once the first expression becomes zero or negative, and so on. Here, `tmp` can be a valid second ranking function because it decreases when `tmp` is reset to 0 after reaching `maxId`.\n\nSo, the multi-phase ranking function for the given program can be `(maxId - tmp, tmp)`. The first expression `maxId - tmp` decreases with each loop iteration until it becomes non-positive. Then, the second expression `tmp` decreases until the loop terminates.\n\nThe ranking function in ACSL syntax would look like this:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant maxId - tmp;\n    loop variant tmp;\n*/\n```\n\nThis is a valid multi-phase ranking function because it satisfies the conditions: the first expression decreases with each loop iteration until it becomes non-positive, then the second expression starts decreasing until the loop terminates.",
            "The program has a single loop, which runs as long as `tmp` is not equal to `id` and `unknown_int()` returns a non-zero value. \nThe variable `tmp` is initially set to `id + 1` and is either incremented or reset to 0 in each iteration of the loop. \n\nFrom this, we can infer that `tmp` will eventually reach `maxId` and then reset to 0, after which it will start increasing again. This process will continue until `tmp` becomes equal to `id`.\n\nSince `id` is non-negative and less than `maxId`, we know that `tmp` will eventually become equal to `id` as it cycles from 0 to `maxId`.\n\nTherefore, one phase of the ranking function can be `maxId - tmp`. This expression decreases with each iteration until `tmp` reaches `maxId`, after which it becomes `maxId`.\n\nBut there is a second phase to consider. When `tmp` is reset to 0, the above expression becomes `maxId`, which is not decreasing. So, we need a second expression that starts decreasing in this case. The expression `tmp - id` serves this purpose. Initially, when `tmp` is reset to 0, this expression is negative. But with each iteration, it increases until `tmp` becomes equal to `id`, at which point it becomes 0 and the loop terminates.\n\nTherefore, the multi-phase ranking function for the loop is:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant maxId - tmp;\n    loop variant tmp - id;\n*/\n```\nThis is a valid ranking function because in the first phase, `maxId - tmp` is always non-negative and decreases with each iteration until `tmp` equals `maxId`. Then, the second phase takes over, where `tmp - id` is initially negative, but increases with each iteration until it becomes 0, at which point the loop terminates.

This ensures **tmp - id = 1** and **maxId - tmp >= 0**.\n\n(ii) In every iteration of the loop, **tmp != id** and **tmp - id <= maxId**. Also, **0 <= tmp <= maxId** and **tmp <= maxId ==> tmp - id = \\at(tmp, LoopEntry) - id**.\n\n(iii) After the loop termination, **tmp = id**. This ensures **maxId - tmp >= 0** and **tmp - id = 0**.\n\nThese invariants are enough to support the ranking function and prove the termination of the loop.\n\nHere are the loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= id;\n    loop invariant id < maxId;\n    loop invariant 0 <= tmp <= maxId;\n    loop invariant tmp != id;\n    loop invariant tmp - id <= maxId;\n    loop invariant tmp <= maxId ==> tmp - id = \\at(tmp, LoopEntry) - id;\n    loop invariant maxId - tmp >= 0;\n    loop invariant tmp - id = 0 ==> tmp = id;\n*/\n```",
