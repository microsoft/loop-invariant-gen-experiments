            "First, let's note the starting values or constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head:\n- x is an unknown integer.\n- y is an unknown integer.\n- z is an unknown integer.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body to find a ranking function. In each iteration of the loop, we have the following updates:\n1. x is increased by either y or z (unknown_int() determines which one is added).\n2. y is increased by z.\n3. z is decreased by 1.\n\nThe loop condition is `x >= 0`. We need to find expressions that decrease and remain positive while the loop is executing.\n\nSince z is decreasing by 1 in every iteration, we can use it as the first expression in our lexicographic ranking function. To ensure that it is positive while the loop is executing, we can use the absolute value of z:\n\n```\nloop variant z >= 0 ? z : -z;\n```\n\nNow, we need to find the second expression. Since x can increase by either y or z, we can't guarantee that it will decrease in every iteration. However, y is increasing by z in every iteration, and since z is decreasing, y will eventually become negative, causing x to decrease. We can use the absolute value of y as the second expression:\n\n```\nloop variant y >= 0 ? y : -y;\n```\n\nSo, the lexicographic ranking function for this loop is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant z >= 0 ? z : -z;\n    loop variant y >= 0 ? y : -y;\n*/\n```\n\nThis is a valid ranking function because:\n- The first expression (z) decreases with every iteration of the loop and remains positive while the loop is executing.\n- If the first expression remains constant, the second expression (y) decreases with every iteration of the loop and remains positive while the loop is executing.",
            "First, let's identify the variables that are live at the loop head: `x`, `y`, and `z`.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body:\n\n1. If `unknown_int()` is non-zero, `x` is updated to `x + y`, otherwise `x` is updated to `x + z`.\n2. `y` is updated to `y + z`.\n3. `z` is updated to `z - 1`.\n\nTo find a lexicographic ranking function, we need to identify expressions that are positive and decrease with each iteration of the loop.\n\nSince `z` decreases by 1 in every iteration, it is a candidate for the first expression in the ranking function.\n\nNow, let's find the next expression in the ranking function. If `z` remains the same, we can look at the change in `x`. Since `x` is updated by adding either `y` or `z`, and `y` is always updated by adding `z`, we can consider the expression `x + y - z` as the next expression in the ranking function.\n\nThus, the lexicographic ranking function for the given loop is (z, x + y - z):\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant z;\n    loop variant x + y - z;\n*/\n```",
            "First, let's make note of the starting values or constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head. We have:\n\n1. x is an unknown integer\n2. y is an unknown integer\n3. z is an unknown integer\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body to find a ranking function.\n\n1. If x >= 0, x is updated to either x + y or x + z, depending on the result of unknown_int(). Note that x does not necessarily decrease in every iteration.\n2. y is always updated to y + z.\n3. z is always decreased by 1.\n\nWith these observations, we can construct a lexicographic ranking function (e1, e2, e3) as follows:\n\n1. e1 = (x >= 0) ? x : -x, which represents the absolute value of x. Since x is always updated to x + y or x + z, it will eventually reach a negative value, causing the loop to terminate.\n2. e2 = (y >= 0) ? y : -y, which represents the absolute value of y. We choose this expression because y is always updated and will eventually decrease.\n3. e3 = z, which is always positive and decreases in every iteration.\n\nSo the lexicographic ranking function is:\n\n```c\n/*@\n    loop variant (x >= 0) ? x : -x;\n    loop variant (y >= 0) ? y : -y;\n    loop variant z;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because:\n\n1. e1 is positive and decreases when the loop continues, eventually causing the loop to terminate.\n2. If e1 remains the same, e2 is positive and decreases, which will also eventually cause the loop to terminate.\n3. If e1 and e2 remain the same, e3 is positive and decreases in every iteration, ensuring loop termination."

This implies that z is always decreasing and x and y are getting closer in each iteration of the loop.\n\nWe can identify the following loop invariants:\n\n1. The value of z is always decreasing.

In particular, they ensure that the value of x does not increase beyond its value at the start of the loop iteration, given the current value of z. This is needed because x is incremented by either y or z in the loop body, and y and z are not necessarily decreasing.\n\nIn the second invariant, if z >= 0, x is incremented by y and y is incremented by z. Therefore, the current value of x is at most its value at the start of the loop iteration plus the value of z at the start of the loop iteration.\n\nIn the third invariant, if z < 0, x is incremented by y and y is incremented by z, but z is also decremented by 1.
