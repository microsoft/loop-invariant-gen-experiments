            "In the given code, the variables that are live at the loop head are `x`, `y`, and `N`.\n\nThe loop continues as long as `x` is less than or equal to `N`, and at each iteration, `x` is either increased by 1 or it is replaced by `2*x + y`, and `y` is increased by 1 if `x` is replaced.\n\nSo, `x` and `y` are increasing at each iteration, but `x` is increasing at a faster rate, which will eventually make `x > N` and terminate the loop.\n\nWe can use `N - x` as a ranking function. `N - x` is positive and decreases at each iteration. If `N - x` remains the same, `y` is positive and decreases.\n\nThe lexicographic ranking function for this loop is `(N - x, -y)`.

            "First, note that the variables that are live at the loop head are `x`, `y`, and `N`.\n\nThe loop condition is `x <= N`, which means that the loop will terminate when `x > N`.\n\nIn the body of the loop, there are two branches: if `unknown_int() != 0`, then `x` is updated to `2*x + y` and `y` is updated to `y + 1`; otherwise, `x` is updated to `x + 1`. \n\nIn both cases, `x` is strictly increasing. Therefore, `N - x` is a valid ranking function: it is positive when the loop is executing and it decreases with every iteration of the loop.\n\nFurthermore, in the first branch of the loop body, `y` is increased by 1. Therefore, if `x` remains the same, then `y` is decreasing. Hence, `-y` is a valid second lexicographic ranking function. \n\nTherefore, the lexicographic ranking functions for this loop are `N - x` and `-y`:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant N - x;\n    loop variant -y;\n*/\n``` \n\nThese ranking functions prove that the loop terminates: `N - x` ensures that `x` will eventually exceed `N`, while `-y` ensures that if `x` does not increase, then `y` will eventually become negative, causing `x` to increase.",

Within the loop, the value of `x` increases with each iteration. This means that `x` is always approaching `N` from below, and `N - x` is a good candidate for the first expression in the ranking function.\n\nThe second part of the loop contains an if-else statement. The `else` part always increments `x` by 1. In the `if` part, `x` is incremented by `2x + y` and `y` is incremented by 1. So, in the worst case, `x` is incremented by 1 and `y` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `-y` can serve as the second expression in the ranking function, since it decreases with every iteration of the loop and is always positive while the loop is executing.\n\nHence, the lexicographic ranking function for the loop is `(N - x, -y)`.\n\nNow we will output the ranking function in one code block, in ACSL syntax, in their lexicographic order.

Therefore, `N - x` is a valid ranking function for this loop as it is always positive when the loop is executing and it decreases with every iteration of the loop.\n\nHowever, we can't directly determine a second ranking function as the increment of `y` is not guaranteed in every iteration.\n\nGiven this, the lexicographic ranking function for this loop can be `(N - x)`.\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant N - x;\n*/\n```\n\nThis is a valid ranking function because `N - x` is always positive and decreases with every iteration of the loop, which guarantees the termination of the loop.

In the second case, `x` increases by 1.

This ensures that `x` cannot increase beyond `N`, which is necessary for the loop to terminate.\n\nThe fourth invariant `x + y >= \\at(x, LoopEntry) + \\at(y, LoopEntry)` asserts that the sum of `x` and `y` is non-decreasing. This is important as the condition `x + y >= 0` must hold for the loop to execute."

            "First, let's identify the variables that are live at the loop head. Those are x, y, and N.\n\nSecond, let's analyze the loop body:\n\n```\nwhile (x <= N) {\n    if (unknown_int() != 0) {\n        x = 2*x + y;\n        y = y + 1;\n    } else {\n        x = x + 1;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the loop body, x is always increasing. When x exceeds N, the loop terminates. So, the first expression of our multi-phase ranking function could be (N - x), which is always non-negative and decreases as long as x <= N.\n\nHowever, we don't know if unknown_int() returns 0 or not, so we can't say for sure how x and y will change in every iteration. If unknown_int() always returns 0, then y would stay the same and x would increase by 1 in every iteration. But if unknown_int() does not return 0, then x would increase more rapidly and y would also increase. Since we can't predict the result of unknown_int(), we can't find a second expression for our ranking function based on the changes of x and y.\n\nTherefore, the only valid ranking function for this loop is (N - x).\n\nHere is the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant N - x;\n*/\n```\n\nThis is a valid ranking function because it is always non-negative and decreases with every iteration of the loop. When it becomes zero, the loop terminates.",
            "The loop invariant is `x <= N`. This suggests that `N - x` can be a ranking function because it decreases with every iteration of the loop, i.e., `x` increases with each iteration.\n\nThe loop does not terminate when `N - x` becomes non-positive, as `x` can still increase. Hence, we need to find a second ranking function that decreases when the first one becomes non-positive.\n\nThe second ranking function is `y`. It decreases when the first ranking function becomes non-positive, because, when `x > N`, `y` decreases with each iteration.\n\nTherefore, the multi-phase ranking function is `(N - x, y)`. This is a valid multi-phase ranking function because:\n- `N - x` is initially positive, decreases with each loop iteration, and becomes non-positive when `x > N`.\n- `y` starts decreasing when `N - x` becomes non-positive and continues to decrease with each loop iteration, hence the loop terminates when `y` becomes non-positive.\n\nHere is the multi-phase ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```c\n/*@\n    loop variant N - x;\n    loop variant y;\n*/\n```",
            "The given program has a loop with two branches. In the first branch, x is updated as 2*x+y and y as y+1. In the second branch, x is updated as x+1.\n\nWe can see that the loop continues as long as x is less than or equal to N. So, we can take N-x as the first expression of our ranking function. This expression decreases with each iteration of the loop, because x is increased in each iteration.\n\nSince the first branch doubles x and adds y (which is also incrementing), it can potentially make x greater than N faster than the second branch. Thus, we can take y as the second expression of our ranking function, which will start decreasing once N-x becomes non-positive.\n\nSo, the multi-phase ranking function for the loop in the given program is (N-x, y). Now, let's write it in ACSL syntax.\n\n```c\n/*@\n    loop variant N - x;\n    loop variant y;\n*/\n```\n\nThis is a valid ranking function because:\n- N - x is always positive inside the loop and decreases with every loop iteration.\n- Once N - x becomes non-positive, y decreases with every loop iteration.\n- When both become non-positive, the loop terminates.\n  \nTherefore, the loop is guaranteed to terminate.",

In the second branch, `x` is incremented by 1. The loop continues as long as `x` is less than or equal to `N`.\n\n1. First, let's look at the first expression. We know that `x` increases with each iteration of the loop, either by getting doubled and added to `y` or by getting incremented by 1. So, `N - x` is a suitable candidate for our first ranking function because it decreases with each iteration of the loop.\n\n2. Now, let's look at the second expression. When `x` gets equal to `N`, the first expression becomes zero. At this point, `y` is still increasing because it gets incremented in the first branch of the loop. So, `-y` is a suitable candidate for our second ranking function because it decreases once the first expression becomes zero.\n\nTherefore, the multi-phase ranking function for the given program is `(N - x, -y)`. The first expression decreases with each iteration of the loop until it becomes zero, at which point the second expression starts decreasing until the loop terminates.\n\nThe loop variant in ACSL syntax would be:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant N - x;\n    loop variant -y;\n*/\n```",

In each iteration of the loop, the value of `x` is either incremented by 1 or `x` is updated as `2*x + y` and `y` is incremented by 1.\n3. The loop does not terminate when `x` is greater than `N`.\n\nFrom these observations, we can define the following ranking functions:\n\n- For the first expression, we can use `N - x`. This expression decreases with each iteration of the loop as `x` is incremented. Once this expression becomes non-positive, it means `x` is greater than or equal to `N` and the loop should terminate.\n\n- For the second expression, we can use `y`. This expression decreases when `N - x` is non-positive. `y` is incremented only when `x` is updated as `2*x + y`.\n\n- The third expression is `N - x - y`. This expression decreases when both `N - x` and `y` are non-positive.\n\nSo, the multi-phase ranking function for the loop in the given program is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant N - x;\n    loop variant y;\n    loop variant N - x - y;\n*/\n```\nThis ranking function is valid because it decreases with each iteration of the loop and eventually becomes non-positive, indicating that the loop will terminate."
