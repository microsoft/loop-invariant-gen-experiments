            "- The loop condition is `x > 0 && y > 0`, which means that both `x` and `y` must be positive for the loop to continue.\n- Inside the loop, `x` and `y` are each updated in one of two ways depending on the condition `unknown_int()`. If the function returns a non-zero value, then `x` is set to some unknown integer and `y` is decreased. If it returns zero, `y` is set to some unknown integer and `x` is decreased.\n- Therefore, we could consider `x` and `y` as potential candidates for the lexicographic ranking function, but we would need to adjust them to ensure they are positive and decreasing. We can use the ternary operator to do this.\n- We have two cases to consider: when `x<y` and `x>=y`. \n\nIn the first case, when `x<y`, `y` is decreased and `x` is set to some unknown integer. Since we do not know the value of `unknown_int()`, we cannot guarantee that `x` will decrease. However, `y` is definitely decreased in this case.\n\nIn the second case, when `x>=y`, `x` is decreased and `y` is set to some unknown integer. Again, we cannot guarantee that `y` will decrease, but `x` is definitely decreased in this case.\n\nSo, we can consider `x` and `y` as part of our lexicographic ranking function. The ranking function would then be `(y, x)` when `x<y` and `(x, y)` when `x>=y`.\n\nThe lexicographic ranking function for this loop would be:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant (x<y) ? y : x;\n    loop variant (x<y) ? x : y;\n*/\n```\n\nThis lexicographic ranking function is valid as for each iteration of the loop, at least one of the expressions in the ranking function decreases and is always positive as required by the loop condition.",
            "Firstly, notice that `x` and `y` are live variables at the start of the loop. Their values are non-deterministic due to `unknown_int()` function but we know that they are both positive due to the loop condition.\n\nIn each loop iteration, either `x` or `y` is decreased by a value between 1 and `min(x, y)`. The other variable is assigned a non-deterministic positive integer.\n\nThis gives us two ranking functions: `x` and `y`. \n\n- For each loop iteration, `x` or `y` is positive and decreases, or remains the same.\n- If `x` remains the same, `y` is positive and decreases.\n- If `y` remains the same, `x` is positive and decreases.\n\nThus, the lexicographic ranking function is `(x, y)` or `(y, x)`. In this case, we choose `(x, y)`.\n\nThe code block in ACSL syntax would be:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n    loop variant y;\n*/\n```\n\nThis lexicographic ranking function is valid because if either `x` or `y` is not decreased in an iteration, then the other must be decreased. This ensures that the ranking function will always decrease with each loop iteration, proving that the loop will eventually terminate.",
            "The loop in the program continues as long as both x and y are greater than 0. Inside the loop, either x or y is decremented by 1 depending on their relative values, and the other variable is assigned an unknown integer value. \n\nA lexicographic ranking function for this loop could be the pair (x, y). \n\nWhy does this work?\n\n- The first expression in the ranking function, x, is positive while the loop is running (as required by the loop condition) and decreases whenever the 'else' branch of the if-statement is taken.\n- The second expression, y, is also positive while the loop is running (again as required by the loop condition) and decreases whenever the 'if' branch of the if-statement is taken.\n\nSo, the output would be:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n    loop variant y;\n*/\n```\nNote: The value of x or y can increase in the next iteration because of the assignment of an unknown integer. But it's guaranteed that the value of x or y will not increase indefinitely because in each iteration at least one of them is decreased by 1. So, the loop will eventually terminate.",
            "The loop in the program continues to run as long as both x and y are greater than 0. Inside the loop, either x or y is decreased by at least one and the other is assigned a new unknown value. The new unknown value could potentially be larger than the previous value, but it is irrelevant as the lexicographic ranking function only requires that one of its expressions decreases.\n\nA suitable lexicographic ranking function for this loop could be (x, y) or (y, x), depending on whether x or y is decreased in the last iteration of the loop. However, since we can't determine which one is decreased in the last iteration, we will have to choose a ranking function that works in either case.\n\nThe chosen lexicographic ranking function is (x, y). \n\nThe first expression, x, is positive for the loop to execute and decreases in every iteration as either x = x - 1 or x = y - 1 (where y < x) is executed, or x is assigned a new unknown value that could potentially be smaller.\n\nThe second expression, y, is also positive for the loop to execute. If x remains the same, then y decreases in every iteration as either y = x - 1 (where x < y) is executed, or y = y - 1 is executed, or y is assigned a new unknown value that could potentially be smaller.\n\nThis ranking function guarantees that the loop terminates, as in each iteration at least one of the expressions x or y strictly decreases, and they are both required to be positive for the loop to execute.\n\nHere is the lexicographic ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n    loop variant y;\n*/\n```",

Both of them are initialized with unknown integers and thus can be any integer.\n\nIn the while loop, we see that the loop will continue as long as x and y are both positive. Each iteration, one of them will decrease, but the other will get an unknown value. \n\nSo, it's not trivial to find a ranking function that strictly decreases in every iteration. But we can use the fact that at least one of x and y decreases in each iteration and none of them can increase beyond their initial values.\n\nTherefore, we can use the sum of x and y as the ranking function, as it will be positive inside the loop and will decrease in each iteration.\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x + y;\n*/\n```\n\nThis is a valid ranking function because the sum of x and y is always positive inside the loop and strictly decreases in each iteration, ensuring termination of the loop."

The loop variant decreases lexicographically in each iteration. This means that either `x` decreases or `x` remains the same and `y` decreases.\n\nSince `x` and `y` are assigned `unknown_int()` in the loop body, there is no upper bound on their values.

This ensures that the values of `x` and `y` keep changing in each iteration, and the lexicographic order of `(x, y)` is maintained.\n\nNow, let's write the loop invariants.\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n    loop invariant \\at(x, LoopEntry) > x || (\\at(x, LoopEntry) == x && \\at(y, LoopEntry) > y);\n*/\n```",

If the condition \"unknown_int()\" is true, then either \"y\" is decreased or remains the same and \"x\" is updated to an unknown integer value. If the condition \"unknown_int()\" is not true, then either \"x\" is decreased or remains the same and \"y\" is updated to an unknown integer value.\n\nTherefore, we can say that in every iteration of the loop, either \"x\" decreases or \"y\" decreases. This supports the ranking function (x, y), which is a lexicographic ranking function.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can identify the following loop invariants:\n- The variables \"x\" and \"y\" are always non-negative. This is because they are initialized to unknown integers and only decrease in the loop.\n- If \"x\" is not decreased in an iteration, then \"y\" decreases in that iteration. Similarly, if \"y\" is not decreased in an iteration, then \"x\" decreases in that iteration. This supports the lexicographic nature of the ranking function (x, y).\n- The variables \"x\" and \"y\" are always less than their values at the beginning of the loop.

The loop invariants `(unknown_int() != 0 ==> (x<y ==> y==\\at(x, LoopEntry) - 1 && x>=0) && (x>=y ==> y==\\at(y, LoopEntry) - 1 && x>=0))` and `(unknown_int() == 0 ==> (x<y ==> x==\\at(x, LoopEntry) - 1 && y>=0) && (x>=y ==> x==\\at(y, LoopEntry) - 1 && y>=0))` are true in every iteration of the loop. After the loop termination, `x<=0` or `y<=0`, which implies that the ranking function is non-positive.",
                    "- The variables x and y are live at the loop head. They start with some unknown value.\n- The loop condition is (x > 0 && y > 0).\n- The ranking function is ((x<y?x:y)) which represents the minimum of x and y.\n- The loop body decreases the minimum of x and y.\n\nFrom the above, we can derive the following loop invariants:\n\n- Before the loop execution, the ranking function is non-negative.\n- In every iteration of the loop, the ranking function decreases.\n- After the loop termination, the ranking function is non-positive.\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n    loop invariant ((x<y?x:y)) >= 0;\n    loop invariant ((x<y?x:y)) <= \\at((x<y?x:y), LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant x <= \\at(x, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant y <= \\at(y, LoopEntry);\n*/\n```\n\nThe invariants are true before the loop execution, because x and y start as non-negative. \n\nDuring every iteration, either x or y (whichever is smaller) decreases, which ensures that the ranking function also decreases. \n\nAfter the loop terminates, the ranking function is non-positive, because the loop condition (x > 0 && y > 0) is no longer true.\n\nThe invariants imply that the ranking function decreases with every iteration, proving the termination of the loop."
