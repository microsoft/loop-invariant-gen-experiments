We have three variables involved in the loop, but `k` is the only one that is monotonically decreasing in every iteration. \n\nTherefore, a potential ranking function for this loop is `k`. This is because `k` is guaranteed to decrease with each iteration of the loop (since `k` is decremented in the loop body), and it is always positive for the loop to continue executing (since the loop condition checks that `j <= k`). \n\nThe ACSL syntax for this would be:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant k;\n*/\n```",

Analyzing the loop body:\n\n    - `tmp` is assigned the value of `i`.\n    - `i` is then assigned the value of `j`.\n    - `j` is assigned the value of `tmp + 1`, which means `j` is always increasing by 1 in each iteration.\n    - `k` is decremented by 1 in each iteration.\n\n3.

This value will decrease with each loop iteration (since `k` is decreasing and `j` is increasing), and it should be positive as long as `j <= k`.\n\nHere is the final output in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant k - j;\n*/\n```",

This means `j` is always increasing by 1. `k` is decreasing by 1 in each iteration. \n- The loop continues to execute as long as `i <= 100` and `j <= k`.\n\nLet's consider `k + 100 - i` as the ranking function. The value of this function decreases with every successive iteration of the loop (as `k` decreases and `i` increases), and it remains positive as long as the loop continues to execute.

These are the variables that could affect whether the loop continues.\n\nThe loop continues as long as `i <= 100` and `j <= k`.\n\nDuring each iteration of the loop:\n- The value of `i` is assigned to `tmp`, and then `i` is updated with the value of `j`.\n- The value of `j` is updated with the value of `tmp + 1`.\n- The value of `k` is decremented by 1.\n\nFrom this, we can see that `k` is decreasing with each iteration of the loop, while `i` and `j` are swapping their values with `j` being increased by 1. `k` is a valid ranking function since it is positive (as `j <= k` for the loop to execute) and decreases with each iteration of the loop.\n\nNext, we need to find an expression that is positive and decreases when `k` remains the same. However, `k` does not remain the same in any iteration of the loop, so we do not need to find a second ranking function.\n\nTherefore, the lexicographic ranking function for this loop is `(k)`. \n\nLet's output this in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant k;\n*/\n```",
            "Here the variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are live at the loop head. \n\nAnalyzing the loop body, we see that `i` and `j` are being swapped with `j` being incremented, and `k` being decremented. \n\nA lexicographic ranking function can be `(k, 100 - i)`\n\n- `k` is positive and decreases with each iteration of the loop, because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration.\n- If `k` remains the same, `100 - i` decreases with each iteration of the loop. This is because `i` is replaced with `j` in each iteration, and `j` is at most `k` which is being decremented, thus `i` is non-decreasing and `100 - i` is non-increasing.\n\nSo, the ACSL syntax will look like this:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant k;\n    loop variant 100 - i;\n*/\n```",
            "1. Let's note the starting values or constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head. \n    - `i`, `j`, and `k` are the variables live at the loop head. Their values are unknown at the start of the loop.\n    - The loop condition is `i <= 100 && j <= k`.\n\n2. Let's analyze the loop body to find a ranking function.\n    - In each iteration, `i` is updated to `j`, `j` is updated to `tmp + 1`, and `k` is decremented by 1.\n    - `tmp` is a temporary variable and doesn't affect the loop termination, so we can ignore it in our analysis.\n    - `i` and `j` don't necessarily decrease, but `k` always decreases.\n\n3. Based on the above analysis, our ranking function should involve `k`, `i`, and `j`. \n    - `k` should be the first expression in the ranking function because it always decreases.\n    - `i` and `j` can be the second and third expressions in the ranking function, but it's not immediately clear how they should be ordered. \n    - Let's consider the loop condition. `i` must be less than or equal to 100 and `j` must be less than or equal to `k`. When `i` is updated to `j`, `j` is always greater than `i`, so `i` should be the second expression in the ranking function and `j` should be the third expression.\n\nThe lexicographic ranking function for this loop is therefore `(k, i, j)`. This is a valid ranking function because `k` always decreases, and when `k` remains the same (which never happens), `i` decreases, and when `k` and `i` remain the same (which also never happens), `j` decreases.\n\nIn ACSL syntax, the ranking function is represented as follows:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant k;\n    loop variant i;\n    loop variant j;\n*/\n```"

            "The loop in the program continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to 100 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are updated in every iteration of the loop. In each loop iteration, `i` is set to the previous value of `j`, `j` is incremented by one, and `k` is decremented by one.\n\nLooking at this, we can infer a couple of things:\n- `k` is always decreasing with each iteration of the loop. This makes `k` a good candidate for a phase in our multi-phase ranking function.\n- `j` is always increasing with each iteration, but `i` takes on the value of `j` from the previous iteration. This means that `j - i` is always 1. When `k` becomes less than `j` (and, by extension, `i`), `j - i` will start decreasing.\n\nThese observations give us our multi-phase ranking function:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant k;\n    loop variant j - i;\n*/\n```\nThis is a valid ranking function because:\n- `k` is always decreasing, and once `k` becomes less than `j` and `i`, the loop stops and we move on to the next phase.\n- In the next phase, `j - i` decreases until it becomes non-positive, at which point the loop stops. This is guaranteed because `j` and `i` both increase by 1 in each iteration, but `i` lags behind `j` by one iteration.",
            "The variables that are live at the loop head are `i`, `j`, and `k`. \n\nSince `i` and `j` are swapped in every iteration and `j` is incremented by 1, the value of `i` will be strictly increasing in every iteration. Also, the value of `k` decreases by 1 in every iteration. \n\nThe loop condition is `i <= 100 && j <= k`. This means that the loop will terminate when `i` becomes greater than 100 or `j` becomes greater than `k`. \n\nSince `i` is increasing and `k` is decreasing, the difference `k - i` is a valid ranking function that decreases in every iteration until it becomes non-positive, at which point the loop terminates. \n\nSo a valid multi-phase ranking function is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant k - i;\n*/\n```\n\nThis function decreases with every iteration of the loop until it becomes non-positive, at which point the loop terminates. It is thus a valid ranking function for the loop in the program.",
            "First, we look at the loop condition. The loop continues as long as `i <= 100` and `j <= k`. \n\nSo, we have two main variables that influence the loop's termination: `i` and `j`. Additionally, `k` also changes in the loop, decreasing by 1 each iteration.\n\nNext, we analyze the changes to these variables within the loop. Each loop iteration, `i` is set to the previous `j`, `j` is set to the previous `i + 1`, and `k` is decremented.\n\nThis means that `i` and `j` change in a way that `i` is always less than or equal to `j` in every iteration. Hence, when `i` reaches 100, `j` will always be greater than 100. And, `k` always decreases with each iteration.\n\nSo, the first expression of our multi-phase ranking function can be `k` since it decreases in each iteration. Once `k` becomes non-positive, the loop will still run as long as `i <= 100` and `j <= k`. But as `j` is always greater or equal to `i`, `i` can be the second expression of our multi-phase ranking function. \n\nSo, the multi-phase ranking function for this program is: \n```\n/*@\n    loop variant k;\n    loop variant i;\n*/\n``` \n\nThis multi-phase ranking function is valid because `k` always decreases with each iteration and `i` decreases when `k` becomes non-positive. Thus, ensuring termination of the loop.",
            "The variables live at the loop head are `i`, `j`, and `k`. \n\nLet's analyze how these variables change in each iteration of the loop:\n\n- `i` gets the value of `j`.\n- `j` gets incremented by 1.\n- `k` gets decremented by 1.\n\nLooking at these updates, we can see that `k` is definitely decreasing in each iteration. This makes it a good candidate for the first expression in our ranking function.\n\nNext, we need to find an expression that decreases once `k` becomes non-positive. The expression `j - i` fits this criterion. When `k` is positive, `j` and `i` are simply swapping values, so `j - i` stays the same. However, once `k` becomes non-positive and the loop continues, `j` will be incrementing while `i` stays the same, so `j - i` will be decreasing.\n\nThus, our multi-phase ranking function is `(k, j - i)`.\n\nLet's write it out in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant k;\n    loop variant j - i;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because `k` is definitely decreasing in each iteration of the loop, ensuring that the first phase of the ranking function eventually becomes non-positive. Once `k` is non-positive, `j - i` starts decreasing, ensuring that the second phase of the ranking function eventually becomes non-positive as well. At this point, the loop must terminate.",
            "The loop in the given program continues as long as `i <= 100` and `j <= k`. `i` and `j` are updated in each iteration with `i` being set to `j` and `j` being set to `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the previous value of `i`. `k` is decreased by 1 in every loop iteration.\n\nFrom this, we can deduce that the first expression in our multi-phase ranking function should be related to `i`, `j` and `k`. Since `k` is decreasing in each loop iteration, it seems reasonable to consider `k` as part of our first expression. We also know that `j <= k` for the loop to continue, so `k - j` is a potential candidate for the first expression. This value will decrease with each iteration of the loop and will be zero or negative when `j > k`.\n\nOnce `k - j` becomes non-positive, `i` is less than or equal to `j` and `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, while `i` takes on the previous value of `j`. This means that `j - i` will increase with each iteration until `i` catches up with `j`, at which point `j - i` will be 0 and the loop will terminate. Therefore, `j - i` is a potential candidate for the second expression in our ranking function.\n\nTherefore, the multi-phase ranking function for the loop in the given program can be expressed as:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant k - j;\n    loop variant j - i;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because it satisfies the requirements for a multi-phase ranking function. The first expression, `k - j`, decreases with each iteration of the loop and becomes non-positive when `j > k`. Once that happens, the second expression, `j - i`, decreases with each iteration until it becomes non-positive, at which point the loop terminates."
