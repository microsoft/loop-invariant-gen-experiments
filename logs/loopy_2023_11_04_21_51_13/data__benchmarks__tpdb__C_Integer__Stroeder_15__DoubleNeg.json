They state that the value of `i` and `j` at the beginning of the loop minus any non-negative integer `x` and `y` that are less than `i` and `j` respectively, are always non-negative. This is always true as `i` and `j` are always decreasing by 1 in each iteration.\n- The third invariant states that the product of `i` and `j` is always positive. This is the loop condition, which is always true during the loop execution.\n- The fourth and fifth invariants support the given ranking function. They state that if `i` is non-negative, `i + j` is non-negative, and if `i` is negative, `-i - j` is non-negative. These are true because `i` and `j` are always either both positive or both negative, due to the loop condition. As `i` and `j` decrease, these expressions decrease as well, which supports the ranking function.",

This function will decrease with every loop iteration if the following conditions hold:\n    - If i and j are both positive, both i and j decrease in every iteration, thus i + j decreases.\n    - If i and j are both negative, both -i and -j increase in every iteration, thus -i - j decreases.\n\n- Now, let's find the loop invariants that guarantee that the conditions for the ranking function to decrease hold in every iteration.\n\n- First, note that the initial values of i and j are unknown and could be any integer.\n\n- It can be observed that once the sign of i and j is set (positive or negative), it never changes during the loop. This is because the loop condition ensures that i and j always have the same sign, and the loop body decreases both i and j, which doesn't change their signs. Therefore, we can make the following loop invariants:\n    - If i is positive at the loop entry, i remains positive in every iteration. Similarly for j.\n    - If i is negative at the loop entry, i remains negative in every iteration. Similarly for j.\n\n- Based on these observations, the following are the loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant (\\at(i, LoopEntry) >= 0) ==> i >= 0;\n    loop invariant (\\at(j, LoopEntry) >= 0) ==> j >= 0;\n    loop invariant (\\at(i, LoopEntry) < 0) ==> i <= 0;\n    loop invariant (\\at(j, LoopEntry) < 0) ==> j <= 0;\n    loop invariant i*j >= 0;\n    loop invariant i <= \\at(i, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant j <= \\at(j, LoopEntry);\n*/\n```\n\n- The first four invariants ensure that the signs of i and j do not change during the loop. The fifth invariant is the loop condition itself. The last two invariants ensure that i and j do not increase during the loop. These invariants together guarantee that the ranking function decreases with every loop iteration, thus proving the termination of the loop.",

This means that the loop invariant should ensure that **i** and **j** are decreasing in each iteration.\n\nLet's consider the following loop invariants:\n\n1. **i + j** is equal to its value at the loop entry. This is because we are decrementing both **i** and **j** in each iteration, so the sum of the two variables remains constant.\n\n2. **i** and **j** are either both greater than 0, or both less than 0. This is because the loop condition **i*j > 0** implies that **i** and **j** should have the same sign.\n\n3. If **i** is greater than or equal to 0, then **i + j** is non-negative.

                    "First, note the starting values of the variables that are live at the loop head.

This is a lexicographic ranking function.\n\nNow, we need to find loop invariants that are true (i) before the loop execution, (ii) in every iteration of the loop and (iii) after the loop termination, such that the loop invariants imply that the ranking function decreases with every iteration.\n\nHere are the loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant \\at(i, LoopEntry) >= i >= 0;\n    loop invariant \\at(j, LoopEntry) >= j >= 0;\n    loop invariant i * j >= 0;\n    loop invariant (\\at(i, LoopEntry) - \\at(j, LoopEntry)) > 0 ==> \\at(i, LoopEntry) - i == \\at(j, LoopEntry) - j;\n    loop invariant (\\at(j, LoopEntry) - \\at(i, LoopEntry)) > 0 ==> \\at(i, LoopEntry) - i < \\at(j, LoopEntry) - j;\n*/\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. The value of \"i\" at the loop entry is greater than or equal to \"i\" and \"i\" is always greater than or equal to 0. This is because \"i\" decreases by 1 in every iteration of the loop and it starts with an unknown non-negative value.\n\n2. The value of \"j\" at the loop entry is greater than or equal to \"j\" and \"j\" is always greater than or equal to 0. This is because \"j\" decreases by 1 in every iteration of the loop and it starts with an unknown non-negative value.\n\n3. The product of \"i\" and \"j\" is always greater than or equal to 0. This is because \"i\" and \"j\" are always non-negative and the loop condition ensures that their product is positive.\n\n4. If \"(i - j) > 0\" at the loop entry, then the difference between the initial value of \"i\" and the current value of \"i\" is equal to the difference between the initial value of \"j\" and the current value of \"j\". This is because \"i\" and \"j\" decrease by 1 in every iteration of the loop.\n\n5. If \"(j - i) > 0\" at the loop entry, then the difference between the initial value of \"i\" and the current value of \"i\" is less than the difference between the initial value of \"j\" and the current value of \"j\". This is because \"i\" and \"j\" decrease by 1 in every iteration of the loop.",

(i - j) : (j - i)\".\n\nLoop invariants that support the validity of the ranking function and prove the termination of the loop are as follows:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant \\at(i, LoopEntry) == i + iteration_count;\n    loop invariant \\at(j, LoopEntry) == j + iteration_count;\n    loop invariant i >= 0 ==> j >= 0;\n    loop invariant i < 0 ==> j < 0;\n    loop invariant i * j > 0;\n    loop invariant (i - j) > 0 ==> i > j;\n    loop invariant (i - j) <= 0 ==> i <= j;\n*/\n```\n\nThe first two loop invariants mean that the values of i and j at the loop entry are equal to their current values plus the number of loop iterations that have passed. \nThe next two loop invariants mean that if i is non-negative, then j is also non-negative and if i is negative, then j is also negative. This is because the loop condition \"i * j > 0\" implies that i and j have the same sign.\nThe fifth loop invariant is the loop condition itself.\nThe last two loop invariants mean that if the second expression of the ranking function \"(i - j) > 0\" is true, then i is greater than j, and if \"(i - j) <= 0\" is true, then i is less than or equal to j.",
                    "First, we know that the loop condition is `i*j > 0`, which means that both `i` and `j` are positive or both are negative. The loop variant is `(i * j, (i - j) > 0 ? (i - j) : (j - i))`. This is a lexicographic variant, where `i * j` decreases in every iteration and if `i * j` remains the same, `(i - j) > 0 ? (i - j) : (j - i)` decreases. \n\nSo, we can make the following observations:\n- The first component of the loop variant is non-negative before the loop starts and decreases with every iteration.\n- The second component of the loop variant is also non-negative before the loop starts and decreases with every iteration.\n\nThe loop invariants that support these observations are as follows:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i * j >= 0;\n    loop invariant (i - j) > 0 ?

(i - j) : (j - i);\n*/\n```\n\nThe first two invariants state that both components of the loop variant are non-negative. The last two invariants state that both components of the loop variant do not increase during the loop.

                    "Firstly, the loop condition is `i*j > 0`. The ranking function is a lexicographic function with two components: `i * j` and `(i - j) > 0 ? (i - j) : (j - i)`. \n\nFrom the loop condition, we know that `i` and `j` must have the same sign for the loop to continue. Both `i` and `j` decrease by 1 in every iteration, so the first component of the ranking function, `i * j`, decreases in every iteration. \n\nThe second component of the ranking function, `(i - j) > 0 ? (i - j) : (j - i)`, represents the absolute value of the difference between `i` and `j`. If `i` and `j` were equal at the beginning of an iteration, they remain equal at the end of the iteration, so this component doesn't decrease. If `i` was greater than `j` at the beginning of an iteration, `i` decreases more than `j` does, so this component decreases. Similarly, if `j` was greater than `i` at the beginning of an iteration, `j` decreases more than `i` does, so this component also decreases.\n\nThus, the ranking function supports the termination of the loop.
