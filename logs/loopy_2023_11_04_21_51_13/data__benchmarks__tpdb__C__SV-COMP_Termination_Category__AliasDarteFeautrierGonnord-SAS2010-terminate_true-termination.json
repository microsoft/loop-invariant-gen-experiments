            "First, note that the variables i, j, and k are live at the loop head.\n\nLooking at the loop body, we can see that in each iteration:\n- i is assigned the value of j,\n- j is assigned the value of ell + 1, where ell is the old value of i,\n- k is decremented by 1.\n\nThe loop condition is i <= 100 && j <= k.\n\nNow, let's find an expression that decreases with every iteration of the loop, and is positive while the loop is executing.\n\nSince k is decremented in every iteration, we can use it as the first expression in our ranking function. Note that k is always greater than or equal to j while the loop is executing, because j <= k is part of the loop condition.\n\nNext, we need to find an expression that decreases whenever k remains constant, and is positive whenever k is positive. Here, we can use i, because it is always less than or equal to 100 (due to the loop condition), and in each iteration, it is assigned the value of j, which is less than or equal to k.\n\nTherefore, a lexicographic ranking function for the loop is (k, i), and we can write it in ACSL syntax as follows:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant k;\n    loop variant i;\n*/\n```\nThis is a valid lexicographic ranking function because:\n- k is positive and decreases in every iteration, and\n- whenever k remains constant, i is positive and decreases.",
            "Firstly, let's understand the constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head. Here, the variables i, j and k are live at the loop head. Their constraints are:\n\n- i is less than or equal to 100.\n- j is less than or equal to k.\n\nIn the loop body, the following operations happen:\n\n- ell is assigned the value of i.\n- i is assigned the value of j.\n- j is incremented by 1 (it becomes ell + 1).\n- k is decremented by 1.\n\nLet's now try to find a lexicographic ranking function for this loop. The first expression must decrease with every iteration and be positive while the loop is executing. \n\nA suitable expression for this is 101 - i, which always decreases as i increases (as i is assigned the value of j in the loop) and is always positive as i is less than or equal to 100.\n\nThe second expression must decrease if the first expression remains the same and be positive while the loop is executing. \n\nA suitable expression for this is k - j + 1, which always decreases as k decreases and j increases, and is always positive as j is less than or equal to k.\n\nSo, the lexicographic ranking function for this loop is (101 - i, k - j + 1).\n\nOutput the ranking function in one code block, in ACSL syntax, in their lexicographic order:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant 101 - i;\n    loop variant k - j + 1;\n*/\n```\n\nThis is a valid ranking function as it meets all the required conditions: it decreases with each loop iteration, and is positive while the loop is executing.",
            "The variables live at the loop head are i, j, and k. They are initialized by the unknown_int() function, so we don't know their starting values. However, we do know that the loop continues as long as `i <= 100` and `j <= k`.\n\nDuring each iteration of the loop, `i` takes the value of `j`, `j` increases by one (it takes the value of `ell + 1` where `ell` is the old value of `i`), and `k` decreases by one.\n\nA possible lexicographic ranking function for this loop is `(100 - i, k - j, k)`. \n\nHere's why:\n- `100 - i` is positive and decreases because `i` increases (or remains the same) during each iteration of the loop, and `i` is always less than or equal to 100.\n- If `100 - i` remains constant (which means `i` does not increase), `k - j` decreases because `j` increases and `k` decreases.\n- If both `100 - i` and `k - j` remain constant, `k` is positive and decreases because it is decremented at each iteration of the loop.\n\nThis lexicographic ranking function proves that the loop terminates because each of its components is a non-negative integer that strictly decreases in at least one iteration of the loop, unless the loop terminates.\n\nSo, the ranking function in ACSL syntax would be:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant 100 - i;\n    loop variant k - j;\n    loop variant k;\n*/\n```",
            "First, let's identify the loop variables: i, j, k, and ell.\n\n- i and j are the loop counters, which get updated in every iteration. \n- k is also a loop counter, but it decreases in each iteration.\n- ell is a temporary variable used for swapping i and j.\n\nNow, we need to find a ranking function which is positive and decreases after each iteration of the loop. \n\n- The first part of the loop condition i <= 100 suggests that 100 - i can be a potential ranking function, as it is positive when the loop is executing and decreases as i increases.\n- The second part of the loop condition j <= k suggests that k - j + 1 can be a potential ranking function, as it is positive when the loop is executing and decreases as j increases and k decreases.\n\nTherefore, the lexicographic ranking function for the loop in the program is (100 - i, k - j + 1). Here is the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@ \n  loop variant 100 - i;\n  loop variant k - j + 1;\n*/\n```\nThis ranking function is valid as it satisfies all the conditions of a lexicographic ranking function: the expressions are positive and decrease after each iteration of the loop.",
            "First, we note that the loop condition is `i <= 100 && j <= k`. This indicates that `i`, `j`, and `k` are all live at the loop head. These are the variables that we need to consider in our ranking function.\n\nNext, we analyze the loop body. The loop body is swapping the values of `i` and `j`, incrementing the value of `j` by one, and decrementing the value of `k` by one.\n\nIf we look closer, we can see that the value of `i` is always less than or equal to `j` in every iteration. This is because `i` is assigned to `j` before `j` is incremented. Also, `j` is always less than or equal to `k` in every iteration because that's the loop condition.\n\nLet's consider the value of `k` first. `k` is decremented in every iteration, and there is no operation in the loop body that could increase the value of `k`. Thus, `k` is a good candidate for the first expression in our ranking function. It is always positive and decreases in each iteration.\n\nNext, let's consider `j`. `j` is incremented in each iteration, but it can never exceed `k` because of the loop condition. Thus, the difference `k - j` is a good candidate for the second expression in our ranking function. It is always positive and decreases in each iteration.\n\nFinally, `i` is always less than or equal to `j`, so the difference `j - i` is a good candidate for the third expression in our ranking function. It is always positive and decreases in each iteration.\n\nSo, a valid lexicographic ranking function for this loop is `(k, k - j, j - i)`. Here is the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```c\n/*@\n    loop variant k;\n    loop variant k - j;\n    loop variant j - i;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because each expression is positive and decreases in each iteration of the loop. Also, if the previous expressions remain the same, the next expression decreases. This guarantees that the loop will eventually terminate."

We need to find loop invariants that support this variant.\n\nBefore the loop execution, we know that i, j, and k can take any integer value, so we can't make any assumptions about them. Therefore, there are no loop invariants before the loop execution.\n\nIn every iteration of the loop, we see that:\n- i is replaced by j and j is replaced by i + 1. This means that in every iteration i <= j and j <= i + 1.\n- k is decremented. This means that k is always decreasing.\n- Since the loop continues as long as i <= 100 && j <= k, we know that i <= 100 and j <= k in every iteration.\n- Also, because i <= j and j <= k, we can say that i <= k.\n\nAfter the loop termination, the condition i <= 100 && j <= k is no longer true. This means that i > 100 or j > k. \n\nBased on the above analysis, we can output the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant i <= 100;\n    loop invariant j <= k;\n    loop invariant i <= j;\n    loop invariant j <= i + 1;\n    loop invariant i <= k;\n    loop invariant \\at(k, LoopEntry) > k;\n*/\n```\nThese invariants hold for every iteration of the loop and they imply that the loop variant (100 - i, k - j, k) decreases with every iteration, which proves the termination of the loop."

The first constraint is that `i` must be less than or equal to `100` and `j` must be less than or equal to `k`.\n\nStep 2: Analyzing the loop body, `i` is updated to `j`, `j` is updated to `ell + 1` and `k` is decremented. We can see that `k` is the only variable that is definitely decreasing with every iteration of the loop. Therefore, `k` can be the first expression of the multi-phase ranking function.\n\nStep 3: Once `k` becomes non-positive, the loop does not necessarily terminate as it is also dependent on `j <= k` becoming false. We need a second expression that decreases once `k` becomes non-positive. As `i` is updated to `j` and `j` is updated to `ell + 1`, `i-j` decreases in each loop iteration after `k` becomes non-positive.\n\nTherefore, the multi-phase ranking function for the loop is `k` and `i-j` and in ACSL syntax, it can be written as:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant k;\n    loop variant i-j;\n*/\n```",
            "At the start of the loop, the live variables are `i`, `j`, and `k`.

Here, `k - j` is a suitable choice because `j` increases and `k` decreases with each iteration, so `k - j` definitely decreases.\n\nThe second part of the ranking function should be an expression that starts decreasing once the first expression becomes non-positive. Here, `101 - i` is a suitable choice because it only starts decreasing when `i` becomes greater than `k` (which means `k - j` has become non-positive), and then it decreases with each iteration as `i` increases.\n\nSo, the multi-phase ranking function is `(k - j, 101 - i)`. This is a valid ranking function because:\n- It is initially positive (assuming `k > j` and `i <= 100` at the start of the loop).\n- It decreases with each iteration of the loop (`k - j` decreases first, then `101 - i` starts decreasing).\n- When it becomes non-positive (both `k - j` and `101 - i` are non-positive), the loop condition `i <= 100 && j <= k` is no longer satisfied and the loop terminates.\n\nThis is expressed in ACSL syntax as:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant k - j;\n    loop variant 101 - i;\n*/\n```",

Looking at the loop body, we see that variable 'k' is decremented in each loop iteration, and since it is not updated anywhere else in the loop, 'k' is a safe choice for the first expression.\n\nNow, once 'k' becomes non-positive, we need to find a second expression that decreases with successive iterations of the loop. We can see that 'j' is incremented in each loop iteration. But, we also swap the values of 'i' and 'j' in each iteration, which means 'j' might not always be strictly decreasing. However, the loop condition ensures that 'j' will always be less than or equal to 'k'. So, once 'k' becomes non-positive, 'j' will start decreasing until it becomes non-positive and the loop will terminate.\n\nTherefore, the ranking function for this loop is:\n\n```c\n/*@\n    loop variant k;\n    loop variant j;\n*/\n```\n\nThis is a valid ranking function because 'k' and 'j' satisfy the conditions of being a multi-phase ranking function.

Also, k is decremented by 1.\n\nThe loop condition is `i <= 100 && j <= k`. Thus, the loop continues to execute as long as both conditions hold true.\n\nFor the first part of our multi-phase ranking function, we can choose `101 - i`. This expression is initially positive (assuming `unknown_int()` does not return a value greater than 100 for i). With each iteration, i is increased, hence `101 - i` decreases.\n\nOnce `101 - i` becomes non-positive, it means that i has reached or surpassed 101. At this point, the second part of the loop condition becomes the determining factor for the continuation of the loop: `j <= k`.\n\nThus, for our second expression, we can choose `k - j + 1`. This expression is initially positive (assuming `unknown_int()` does not return a value greater than k for j). With each iteration, j is increased and k is decreased, hence `k - j + 1` decreases.\n\nThe ranking function for the loop in the given program is then:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant 101 - i;\n    loop variant k - j + 1;\n*/\n```\n\nThis is a valid ranking function as it satisfies the criteria of a multi-phase ranking function.

Once it is non-positive, the second expression `k - j + 1` starts decreasing with each iteration until it too becomes non-positive, at which point the loop terminates.",
            "The loop is controlled by two conditions, `i <= 100` and `j <= k`. So, the loop will terminate when either `i > 100` or `j > k`. \n\nThe variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are updated in every iteration. `i` is assigned the value of `j`, `j` is incremented, and `k` is decremented. \n\nLet's start with `i <= 100`. `i` is updated to `j` in every iteration, and `j` is incremented by 1 in every iteration.
