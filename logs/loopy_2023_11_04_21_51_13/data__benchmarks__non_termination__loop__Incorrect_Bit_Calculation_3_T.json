            "The loop in the given program continues as long as the expression `(wc = ( wc >> 6 ) & mask)` is true. \n\nIn each iteration, `wc` is right-shifted by 6 and then bitwise ANDed with `mask` which is `( 1 << 26 ) - 1`. This operation effectively reduces the number of set bits in `wc`, since the right shift operation discards the least significant bits.\n\n`wc` is an integer that is non-deterministically assigned at the start of the program. Since it is unknown whether `wc` is positive, negative, or zero, we can't make any assumptions about its initial value. \n\nHowever, the operation `( wc >> 6 ) & mask` guarantees that `wc` is non-negative after the first iteration of the loop, and that it decreases with each subsequent iteration, because the right shift operation effectively divides `wc` by 2^6.\n\nThus, a valid ranking function for this program is `wc`.\n\nHere is how you can write it in ACSL syntax:\n\n```c\n/*@\n    loop variant wc;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because it satisfies the criteria mentioned above. In the first iteration, `wc` is non-negative and decreases with each subsequent iteration. When `wc` becomes zero, the loop terminates. Therefore, this ranking function proves that the loop always terminates.",
            "First, let's understand the loop:\n\nThe loop condition is `(wc = ( wc >> 6 ) & mask)`. This means, in each iteration, `wc` is right-shifted by 6 and bitwise-and-ed with `mask`, and the result is assigned back to `wc`. The loop continues as long as the result is non-zero.\n\nSince `mask` is `( 1 << 26 ) - 1`, it means `mask` is a 26-bit number with all bits set to 1. When `wc` is bitwise-and-ed with `mask`, it effectively keeps only the lower 26 bits of `wc`.\n\nRight-shifting `wc` by 6 bits essentially means dividing `wc` by `64` (or `2^6`). Therefore, `wc` is divided by `64` in each iteration, and only the lower 26 bits are kept.\n\nSince `wc` is divided by `64` in each iteration, it is guaranteed to decrease with each iteration, until it reaches 0.\n\nTherefore, the ranking function is `wc`.\n\nNow, let's write down the ranking function in ACSL syntax. Since there's only one ranking function, there's no need to divide it into phases.\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant wc;\n*/\n```",
            "The loop in the given program is a while loop and it iterates as long as the condition `(wc = ( wc >> 6 ) & mask)` is true.\n\nThe value of `wc` is non-deterministically updated in the loop condition itself. In each iteration of the loop, `wc` is right-shifted by 6 and bitwise-and operation is performed with `mask` (which is `( 1 << 26 ) - 1`).\n\nHere, the variable `wc` is updated in a way that its value decreases in each iteration. The value of `wc` after the right shift operation will be less than or equal to the original value of `wc`.\n\nTherefore, the ranking function can be simply the variable `wc`.\n\nThe ranking function in ACSL syntax will be:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant wc;\n*/\n```\n\nThis is a valid ranking function because `wc` decreases with each iteration of the loop until it becomes zero, at which point the loop terminates.",
            "Let's begin by noting the starting values or constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head.\n\nWe have two variables: `wc` and `mask`. The value of `mask` is constant and equals `(1 << 26) - 1` which is a large positive integer. The value of `wc` is non-deterministic and we do not have any constraints on it.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body. The loop does not have any body. The only thing it does is to update the value of `wc` in the loop condition. In each iteration, the value of `wc` is right shifted by 6 bits and then bitwise AND operation with `mask` is performed. This operation ensures that the value of `wc` decreases in each iteration. \n\nWe can choose `wc` as the first expression in our ranking function. The value of `wc` will decrease with each iteration of the loop until it becomes non-positive, at which point the loop terminates.\n\nSince there are no other variables that are updated in the loop, our ranking function only has one phase.\n\nHere is the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant wc;\n*/\n```",

This operation effectively removes the lower 6 bits of `wc` in each iteration, which means the value of `wc` is decreasing.\n\nTherefore, `wc` can be used as a ranking function for this loop. \n\nThe loop invariant is that `wc` is non-negative, because the bitwise operation does not change the sign of an integer. \n\nThe termination condition of the loop is when `wc` becomes zero. \n\nSo, the ranking function is valid because it decreases with every iteration of the loop until it becomes zero, at which point the loop terminates. \n\nTherefore, the ranking function for this loop is `wc`.
