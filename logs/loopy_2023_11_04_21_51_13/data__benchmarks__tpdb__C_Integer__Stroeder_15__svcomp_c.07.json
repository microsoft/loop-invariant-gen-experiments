The value of the ranking function decreases with every iteration of the loop: In each iteration, j is increased by 1 (j = tmp + 1) and k is decreased by 1 (k = k - 1).

If the first expression remains the same, we need to find a second expression that is positive and decreases:\n\n- The only situation in which `k - j` remains constant is if `i` becomes greater than 100.

This is because `i` is updated to the value of `j` and `j` is updated to `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the old value of `i`.\n- The value of `i` at the start of any iteration is less than or equal to the value of `i` at the end of that iteration. This is because `i` is only updated to the value of `j`, which is always greater than or equal to `i`.\n- The value of `k` at the start of any iteration is greater than or equal to the value of `k` at the end of that iteration.

This means that the value of `k - i` decreases in every iteration, and if it remains the same, `100 - i` decreases.\n\nNext, let's identify loop invariants:\n\n1. `i` is non-negative and less than or equal to `k` and `100`. This is true because `i` is initially non-negative and always assigned the value of `j`, which is less than or equal to `k` by the loop condition. It is also less than or equal to `100` by the loop condition. This invariant supports the ranking function by ensuring that `k - i` and `100 - i` are non-negative.\n2. `j` is non-negative and less than or equal to `k` and `100`. This is true because `j` is initially non-negative and always assigned the value of `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is less than or equal to `k` and `100` by the loop condition and the first invariant. This invariant supports the ranking function by ensuring that `k - i` and `100 - i` decrease when `j` is assigned to `i`.\n3. `k` is non-negative and decreases with every iteration. This is true because `k` is initially non-negative and decremented by 1 in every iteration. This invariant supports the ranking function by ensuring that `k - i` decreases with every iteration.\n4. `c` is non-negative and increases with every iteration. This is true because `c` is initially 0 and incremented by 1 in every iteration. This invariant does not directly support the ranking function but is necessary for the correctness of the program.\n\nHere are the loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i >= 0;\n    loop invariant i <= k;\n    loop invariant i <= 100;\n    loop invariant j >= 0;\n    loop invariant j <= k;\n    loop invariant j <= 100;\n    loop invariant k >= 0;\n    loop invariant c >= 0;\n*/\n```\nThese invariants imply that the ranking function `(k - i, 100 - i)` decreases with every iteration of the loop, which proves the termination of the loop.",
