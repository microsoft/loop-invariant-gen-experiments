The initial values of these variables are not known because they are assigned values from the function `unknown_int()`. \n\nIn each loop iteration:\n- `i` is assigned the value of `j`.\n- `j` is incremented by 1 (since `j = ell + 1` and `ell` was previously assigned the value of `i`).\n- `k` is decremented by 1.\n\nThe loop continues executing as long as `i <= 100` and `j <= k`.\n\nA suitable ranking function in this case would be `k - j`. This is because `j` increases by 1 and `k` decreases by 1 in each loop iteration, so `k - j` would decrease by 2 in every iteration. This makes it a valid ranking function as it is positive and decreases with each loop iteration.\n\nThus, the ranking function can be written as:\n```c\n/*@\n    loop variant k - j;\n*/\n```",

So, the variables i, j and k are all involved in determining whether the loop continues.\n\nOne potential ranking function could be the difference between k and i. This value is positive when the loop continues (since j <= k and i = j in each iteration, it follows that i <= k) and decreases with each loop iteration (since k decreases by one and i increases by one in each iteration). \n\nSo, the ranking function in ACSL syntax would be:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant k - i;\n*/\n```\nThis ranking function is valid because it is positive and decreases with each iteration of the loop, demonstrating that the loop must eventually terminate.",

Here's why:\n\n- `100 - i` is always positive as long as the loop continues (because `i <= 100` is a loop condition). This value decreases with each iteration, because i increases (i gets the value of j, and j is `ell + 1` which is `i + 1` before the assignment).\n- If `100 - i` remains the same, then `k - j` must decrease. `k - j` is always positive as long as the loop continues (`j <= k` is a loop condition). This value decreases with each iteration because k is decremented and j is incremented.\n\nSo, this lexicographic ranking function validates the termination of the loop.

So, `k` could be our first expression in the ranking function.\n2. If `k` remains the same, then `j` increases in each iteration, as it is incremented by 1. However, the ranking function requires the expression to be positive and decrease. Therefore, we can consider `101-j` as our second expression in the ranking function. `101-j` is positive and decreases as long as `j` is less than or equal to 100. \n3. If `k` and `j` remain the same, then `i` changes in each iteration, as it takes the value of `j`. However, the ranking function requires the expression to be positive and decrease. Therefore, we can consider `101-i` as our third expression in the ranking function. `101-i` is positive and decreases as long as `i` is less than or equal to 100.\n\nTherefore, the lexicographic ranking function for this loop is (`k`, `101-j`, `101-i`). This is a valid ranking function as each expression is positive and decreases, and if the previous expressions remain the same, the next expression decreases. \n\nThe ranking function in ACSL syntax is as follows:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant k;\n    loop variant 101-j;\n    loop variant 101-i;\n*/\n```",

In this loop, the variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are live at the loop head, and their values are set to `unknown_int()`, which could be any integer value.\n\nNext, let's analyze the loop body. The loop condition is `i <= 100 && j <= k`. The loop continues as long as both `i` and `j` are less than or equal to `k` and `i` is less than or equal to 100. Inside the loop, `ell` is assigned the value of `i`, then `i` is assigned the value of `j`, `j` is assigned the value of `ell + 1`, and `k` is decremented by 1.\n\nFrom this, we can see that:\n\n1. `i` and `j` are swapped in each iteration, and `j` is incremented by 1.\n2. `k` is decremented by 1 in each iteration.\n\nSo, as the loop progresses, `i` and `j` are increasing, while `k` is decreasing.\n\nWe need to find a ranking function such that:\n\n1. The first expression in the ranking function is positive and decreases.\n2. If the first expression remains the same, the second expression is positive and decreases.\n3. If the first and second expressions remain the same, the third expression is positive and decreases and so on.\n\nGiven these conditions, one possible lexicographic ranking function for this loop is `(k, -i, -j)`.

Here is the lexicographic ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant k;\n    loop variant j - i;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function proves that the loop terminates because `k` decreases in each iteration and `j - i` decreases whenever `k` does not change.

Since `i`, `j`, and `k` are initialized with `unknown_int()`, we do not have any specific constraints on their starting values. We can, however, analyze the loop condition which tells us that `i <= 100` and `j <= k` for the loop to continue.\n\nNow let's analyze the loop body to find the ranking function:\n\n1. In each iteration, `ell` is assigned the value of `i`.\n2. Then, `i` is assigned the value of `j`.\n3. `j` is assigned the value of `ell + 1`, which means `j` becomes `i + 1`.\n4. Finally, `k` is decremented by 1.\n\nSince `i` and `j` are being updated in each iteration, we can focus on these variables for the ranking function.\n\nInitially, `i <= 100` and `j <= k`. After each loop iteration, `i` is assigned the value of `j`, and `j` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Thus, the value of `i` increases with each iteration. We can use `100 - i` as the first expression in the ranking function, as it will decrease with successive iterations of the loop.\n\nNext, we look for a second expression that decreases once the first expression becomes zero or negative. Since `j <= k`, when `100 - i` becomes non-positive, `j` must be greater than `i` and less than or equal to `k`. We can use `k - j` as the second expression in the ranking function, as it will decrease with successive iterations of the loop once the first expression becomes non-positive.\n\nSo, the multi-phase ranking function for the loop is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant 100 - i;\n    loop variant k - j;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because the first expression, `100 - i`, decreases with successive iterations of the loop until it becomes non-positive.

We can choose `k` as the first expression because `k` is decreasing by 1 in every iteration: `k = k - 1;`.\n\nFor the second expression, we need to find an expression that decreases once the first expression becomes zero or negative. In this case, once `k` becomes non-positive, we can look at the difference between `j` and `i`. Since `i = j;` and `j = ell + 1;`, we have `j - i = (ell + 1) - j = (i + 1) - j`.

Since the loop invariant states that `i` and `j` are less than or equal to 100, we can conclude that `j > k`.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can write the loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= i <= 100;\n    loop invariant 0 <= j <= 100;\n    loop invariant k <= \\at(k, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant i <= k + 1;\n*/\n```"

Also, since `j` increases with every iteration and `i` at the end of the iteration is equal to `j` at the start of the iteration, `(i + 1) - j` decreases with every iteration.\n\nTaking all these into account, we get the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant \\at(i, LoopEntry) <= 100;\n    loop invariant \\at(j, LoopEntry) <= \\at(k, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant i == \\at(j, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant \\at(j, LoopEntry) < j;\n    loop invariant \\at(k, LoopEntry) - 1 == k;\n*/\n```",

This satisfies the conditions of a lexicographic ranking function.\n\nWe can now start to form our loop invariants. We note that the variables `i`, `j`, `k` are live at the loop head and `ell` is not live at the loop head.\n\nThe loop invariants we can output for this loop are:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant \\at(i, LoopEntry) <= i <= 101;\n    loop invariant \\at(j, LoopEntry) <= j <= \\at(i, LoopEntry) + 1;\n    loop invariant \\at(k, LoopEntry) >= k >= \\at(j, LoopEntry) - 1;\n    loop invariant (i <= 100 && j <= k) ==> (\\at(k, LoopEntry) - k + (\\at(i, LoopEntry) + 1 - j) >= 0);\n    loop invariant (i > 100 || j > k) ==> (\\at(k, LoopEntry) - k + (\\at(i, LoopEntry) + 1 - j) == 0);\n*/\n```\nThe first three invariants bound the maximum and minimum values that `i`, `j`, and `k` can take.
