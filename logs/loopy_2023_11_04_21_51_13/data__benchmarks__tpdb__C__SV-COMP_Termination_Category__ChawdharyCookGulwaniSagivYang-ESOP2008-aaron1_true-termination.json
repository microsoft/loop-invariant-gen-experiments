This implies that `an >= i` and `bn >= j` imply `an - i` decreases, and `an <= i` and `bn >= j` imply `bn - j` decreases.\n\nLet's add these invariants:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant an >= i ==> \\at(an - i, LoopEntry) >= an - i;\n    loop invariant bn >= j ==> \\at(bn - j, LoopEntry) >= bn - j;\n*/\n```\n\n5. Finally, we know that the loop terminates when `an < i || bn < j || (an == i && bn == j)`. This implies that `an - i < 0 || bn - j < 0 || (an - i == 0 && bn - j == 0)`. This is a loop invariant that holds after the loop terminates.\n\nLet's add this invariant:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant an < i || bn < j || (an == i && bn == j);\n*/\n```\n\nSo, the final set of loop invariants is:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant an >= i;\n    loop invariant bn >= j;\n    loop invariant an + bn >= i + j;\n    loop invariant an >= i ==> \\at(an - i, LoopEntry) >= an - i;\n    loop invariant bn >= j ==> \\at(bn - j, LoopEntry) >= bn - j;\n    loop invariant an < i || bn < j || (an == i && bn == j);\n*/\n```"
