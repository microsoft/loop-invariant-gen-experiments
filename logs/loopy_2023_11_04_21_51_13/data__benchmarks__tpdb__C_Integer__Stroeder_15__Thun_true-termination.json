We want `v` to be positive and decreasing in each loop iteration.\nConsider the ranking function `v = x + y`.\n\n4. Check the properties of the ranking function:\n- Positive value: `x >= 0` is the loop condition, so `x` is positive while the loop is executing. Since `x = x + y` in the loop body, initially `y` must be non-negative, so `v = x + y` is also positive.\n- Decreasing: In each loop iteration, `x` is updated as `x = x + y`, and `y` is updated as `y = (-2)*y - 1`. So, in the next iteration, `v' = x' + y' = (x + y) + (-2)*y - 1 = v - 2*y - 1`. Since `y` is non-negative, `v' < v`.\n\nNow, we have a valid ranking function: `v = x + y`.

Analyze the loop body and find a ranking function involving the variables in the loop body:\n\nIn each iteration of the loop, `x` is updated to `x + y`, and `y` is updated to `(-2)*y - 1`. We need to find a ranking function such that its value decreases with each iteration and is positive while the loop is executing.\n\nLet's consider the ranking function `x`. Since `x` is non-negative at the beginning of the loop, the ranking function is positive while the loop is executing. However, as `y` can be positive or negative, `x` may not necessarily decrease with each iteration.\n\nNow, let's consider the ranking function `x + y`. While the loop is executing, the value of `x + y` is assigned to `x`. The value of `y` changes in each iteration, but the sum `x + y` is always assigned to `x`. Therefore, the ranking function `x + y` is positive while the loop is executing. Moreover, as `y` is updated to `(-2)*y - 1`, the value of `y` is decreasing in each iteration, which ensures that the value of `x + y` also decreases with each iteration.\n\nBased on this analysis, the ranking function for this loop is `x + y`. The ranking function is valid because it is positive while the loop is executing, and its value decreases with each iteration of the loop.\n\nHere is the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x + y;\n*/\n```",

However, due to the unknown initial values of x and y, we cannot directly find an absolute expression for the ranking function.\n\nBut we can make an observation. In every iteration, y is multiplied by -2 and decremented by 1. This means that the absolute value of y will strictly increase in every iteration.\n\nWe can use this property to create a ranking function that is decreasing and positive while the loop is executing.\n\nTherefore, we can use the ranking function `x + abs(y)`:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x + (y >= 0 ? y : -y);\n*/\n```"

We can choose x itself as the first expression. Since x is non-negative in the loop condition (x >= 0), x is positive. In each iteration, x is updated to x + y. Since the value of y can be positive or negative, we cannot guarantee that x always decreases, but we can still use x as the first expression in the lexicographic ranking function.\n\nFor the second expression, let's choose the absolute value of y, which we can represent as (y >= 0 ? y : -y).

Since `x` is part of our ranking function, we know that it should decrease with every iteration. However, `x` is being incremented in every iteration which contradicts our requirement. But, from the second statement, we can see that `y` is being multiplied by `-2` and decremented by `1` in every iteration. Hence, `y` is becoming more negative with each iteration. This means that `x` is being incremented by an increasingly larger negative number in every iteration, which implies that `x` is decreasing with every iteration.\n\nFrom the second statement, we can also observe that `y` is changing its sign in every iteration. Since the absolute value of `y` is part of our ranking function, we need to ensure that it decreases when `y` changes its sign. From the second statement, we can see that `y` is not only changing its sign but also its absolute value is increasing with every iteration. Hence, the absolute value of `y` is decreasing with every iteration.\n\nSo we can conclude that the ranking function `(x, (y >= 0 ? -y : y))` decreases with every iteration of the loop.\n\nThe loop invariants that support the validity of the ranking function and prove the termination of the loop are:\n```\n/*@ \n\tloop invariant x >= 0;\n\tloop invariant y == \\at(y, LoopEntry) * (-2)^(\\at(x, LoopEntry) - x) - 2*((\\at(x, LoopEntry) - x) + 1);\n*/\n```\nThe first invariant `x >= 0` is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.

This is because `x` decreases in every iteration of the loop since `x` is updated to `x + y` and `y` is always getting more negative.\n\nWhen `x` becomes non-positive, `y` starts to decrease. We can see this because `y` is updated to `(-2)*y - 1`, which is always more negative than the previous value of `y`. \n\nTherefore, we can use `y` as the second part of our multi-phase ranking function.\n\nSo the multi-phase ranking function for this loop is `(x, y)`.\n\nWe can express this in ACSL syntax as follows:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n    loop variant y;\n*/\n```\n\nThis is a valid ranking function because the first expression, `x`, decreases with each iteration of the loop until it becomes non-positive, at which point the second expression, `y`, starts to decrease, ensuring that the loop will eventually terminate.",

Let's consider the loop. \n\nIn the loop, we see that x is updated as `x = x + y`, and y is updated as `y = (-2)*y - 1`. \n\nConsidering the constraint of the loop `while (x >= 0)`, we can see that x decreases in each iteration of the loop, once x becomes non-positive, the loop terminates. \n\nFor the first expression, let's choose x, as it immediately decreases with every iteration of the loop. \n\nFor the second expression, we can see that once x becomes non-positive, y decreases with every iteration of the loop as y is updated as `y = (-2)*y - 1`, which makes y to decrease in each iteration. \n\nTherefore, the multi-phase ranking function is (x, y). \n\nThe multi-phase ranking function in ACSL syntax is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n    loop variant y;\n*/\n```\n\nThis is a valid ranking function because x decreases with each iteration of the loop until it becomes non-positive, and then y decreases with each iteration of the loop, ensuring that the loop will eventually terminate.",

So, `x` can be the first expression in the ranking function.\n\nOnce `x` becomes non-positive, the value of `y` starts decreasing with every loop iteration. Therefore, `y` can be the second expression in the ranking function.\n\nHowever, the value of `y` may not always decrease in each iteration, as it depends on the value of `y` before the iteration. So, it's not a good choice for the ranking function.\n\nInstead, we can use the absolute value of `y` as the second expression in the ranking function. This is because the absolute value of `y` is guaranteed to decrease in each iteration once `x` becomes non-positive.\n\nSo, the multi-phase ranking function for this loop is `(x, |y|)`, where `|y|` is the absolute value of `y`.\n\nIn ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n    loop variant (y >= 0 ? y : -y);\n*/\n```"

This indicates that with every iteration of the loop, the value of x is increased by the current value of y, and the value of y is updated to its negative and then subtracted by 1.\n\nGiven these observations, we can derive the following loop invariants:\n\n```c\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant \\at(x, LoopEntry) >= x;\n    loop invariant \\at(y, LoopEntry) <= y <= -\\at(y, LoopEntry) - 1;\n*/\n```",
                    "First, let's understand the loop. In each iteration, `x` is increased by `y`, and `y` is multiplied by -2 and decreased by 1. The loop continues as long as `x` is non-negative.\n\nNow, let's analyze the provided variant `(x, (y >= 0 ? y : -y))`. This is a lexicographic ranking function, where `x` decreases first, and if `x` remains the same, `(y >= 0 ? y : -y)` decreases. However, `x` is not decreasing, it is actually increasing or decreasing depending on the value of `y`. But we can see that the absolute value of `y` is always increasing, which means that if `x` stays the same, `(y >= 0 ? y : -y)` will decrease.\n\nGiven this, our loop invariants could be:\n\n(i) Before the loop execution:\n- `x` is an arbitrary integer.\n- `y` is an arbitrary integer.\n\n(ii) In every iteration of the loop:\n- `y` is always multiplied by -2 and then decreased by 1, so its absolute value is always increasing. \n\n(iii) After the loop termination:\n- The loop terminates when `x` is negative.\n\nSo, the loop invariants are:\n\n```c\n/*@ \n    loop invariant \\at(x, LoopEntry) == x;\n    loop invariant y == \\at(y, LoopEntry)*(-2) - 1;\n    loop invariant x < 0 ==> \\at(x, LoopEntry) == x;\n*/\n```\n\nThese invariants imply that the ranking function `(x, (y >= 0 ? y : -y))` decreases with every iteration, and thus prove the termination of the loop.",
                    "Firstly, note the loop condition \"x >= 0\" and the loop body, which contains the operations \"x = x + y;\" and \"y = (-2)*y - 1;\". This suggests that the value of 'x' is decreasing in each iteration and 'y' is always decreasing.\n\nThe given loop variant is a lexicographic ranking function. The first component 'x' decreases whenever it is non-negative. The second component 'y >= 0 ? y : -y' decreases whenever 'x' is non-negative and remains the same. \n\nBefore the loop, we do not know anything about the values of 'x' and 'y'. Therefore, the loop invariant that is true before the loop would be \n\"x == \\at(x, LoopEntry) && y == \\at(y, LoopEntry)\".\n\nIn every iteration of the loop, the loop invariants are as follows:\n- \"x <= \\at(x, LoopEntry)\" because 'x' is decreasing in each iteration.\n- \"y == -2*\\at(y, LoopEntry) - 1\" because 'y' is updated as \"-2*y - 1\" in each iteration.\n\nAfter the loop, we know that the loop condition \"x >= 0\" is false. Therefore, the loop invariant that is true after the loop is \"x < 0\".\n\nThe loop invariants are as follows:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x == \\at(x, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant y == \\at(y, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant x <= \\at(x, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant y == -2*\\at(y, LoopEntry) - 1;\n    loop invariant x < 0;\n*/\n```\n\nThese invariants support the given ranking function and can be used to prove the termination of the loop.",
                    "- The initial values of `x` and `y` are non-deterministic.\n- The loop condition is `x >= 0`.\n- The loop variant is `(x, (y >= 0 ? y : -y))`.\n\nWe can see that `x` is decreasing in every iteration since `y` is always negative in the loop and `x` is incremented by `y`. \nFor the second component of the loop variant, we can see that `y` is doubled and decremented in each iteration. Therefore, the absolute value of `y` is increasing in every iteration.\n\nTherefore, we can write the loop invariants as follows:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= \\at(x, LoopEntry) + \\at(y, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant \\at(y, LoopEntry) <= 0 ==> y <= 2*\\at(y, LoopEntry) - 1;\n    loop invariant \\at(y, LoopEntry) > 0 ==> y >= 2*\\at(y, LoopEntry) - 1;\n*/\n```\n\nThe first loop invariant states that `x` is always less than or equal to its initial value plus the initial value of `y`. This is because `x` is incremented by `y` in every iteration, and `y` is always negative in the loop.\n\nThe second and third loop invariants state that the absolute value of `y` is always greater than or equal to double its initial value minus one. This is because `y` is doubled and decremented in every iteration. The second invariant is for the case when the initial value of `y` is negative, and the third invariant is for the case when the initial value of `y` is positive."
