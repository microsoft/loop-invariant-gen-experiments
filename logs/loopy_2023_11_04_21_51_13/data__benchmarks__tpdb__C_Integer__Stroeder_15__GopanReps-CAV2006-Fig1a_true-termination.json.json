When `x > 50`, `y` will start decreasing by 1 in each iteration. We can use the difference between the upper bound of `x` (50) and the current value of `x` as our ranking function. \n\nThe ranking function is: `(50 - x)`\n\nNow, let's check if it is a valid ranking function:\n\n1.

Determine a ranking function that decreases with every iteration of the loop and is positive while the loop is executing:\n   We can use the expression `51 - x` as the ranking function. This is because as `x` increases, the value of `51 - x` decreases. When `x > 50`, `y` starts to decrease, and the loop will eventually terminate when `y` becomes negative.\n\nOutput the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant 51 - x;\n*/\n```",

Inside the loop, `y` is incremented when `x <= 50` and decremented when `x > 50`.\n4. `x` is always incremented by 1.\n5. Therefore, `x` is monotonically increasing which implies that `x` always decreases from the upper bound (infinity in this case).\n6. `y` will increase as long as `x <= 50` and decrease when `x > 50`. This means `y` will always decrease from its maximum value which is reached when `x = 50`.\n\nBased on these observations, the lexicographic ranking function for this loop is `(INT_MAX - x, 51 - y)`.\n\nThis ranking function is valid because:\n- `INT_MAX - x` is always positive when the loop is executing. It decreases at every iteration because `x` is increased by 1 in each iteration.\n- When `x <= 50`, `y` is incremented, and `51 - y` decreases. When `x > 50`, `y` is decremented, and `51 - y` also decreases. So `51 - y` is positive while the loop is executing and decreases at every iteration.\n\nSo, the ranking function is:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant INT_MAX - x;\n    loop variant 51 - y;\n*/\n```",
            "First, let's identify the variables that are live at the loop head. These are `x` and `y`.\n\nNext, let's identify the changes to these variables inside the loop. We can see that `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, while `y` is incremented by 1 if `x` is less than or equal to 50, and decremented by 1 if `x` is greater than 50.\n\nTherefore, we can identify two expressions that change during each loop iteration: `x` and `y`. \n\nThe first expression, `x`, always increases. However, a valid ranking function must decrease. To make it decrease, we can consider `51 - x` as the first expression. This starts from 51 when `x` is 0, and decreases to 0 when `x` is 51.\n\nThe second expression, `y`, increases when `x <= 50` and decreases when `x > 50`. Hence, we can consider `-y` as the second expression. It is negative (which is less than any positive number), and it decreases whenever `x > 50`.\n\nLet's write these two expressions as the lexicographic ranking function for the loop. \n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant 51 - x;\n    loop variant -y;\n*/\n```\n\nThis is a valid ranking function because:\n- `51 - x` is positive and decreases as long as `x <= 50` (during the first part of the loop). \n- When `x > 50`, `51 - x` remains constant (and is 0), and `-y` starts decreasing (as `y` starts to increase). Hence, the pair `(51 - x, -y)` is lexicographically decreasing, and is always positive as long as the loop continues to run. \n\nThis guarantees that the loop will eventually terminate.",
            "The loop condition is `y >= 0`, so the loop continues to run as long as `y` is greater than or equal to 0. \n\nLooking at the loop body, we can see that `y` is increased by 1 if `x` is less than or equal to 50, and decreased by 1 otherwise. `x` is increased by 1 in every iteration.\n\nSo, the first expression in the lexicographic ranking function can be `51 - x` when `x <= 50`. This expression decreases as `x` increases and is positive as long as `x <= 50`.\n\nWhen `x > 50`, `y` starts to decrease. So, the second expression in the lexicographic ranking function can be `y` when `x > 50`. This expression decreases as `y` decreases and is positive as long as `y >= 0`.\n\nHence, the lexicographic ranking function is `(51 - x, y)`.\n\nThis is a valid ranking function because for every iteration of the loop, at least one of the expressions in the lexicographic ranking function decreases, and all expressions are positive while the loop is executing.\n\nHere is the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant (x <= 50) ?

Since `x` always increases, it cannot be part of a lexicographic ranking function. However, `y` does decrease after `x` reaches 51, so it can be a part of our ranking function.\n\nBut we need to ensure that the expressions in our ranking function are always positive. Hence, we need to find a way to convert the `y` expression such that it is positive and decreases.\n\nOne way to do that is by taking the upper bound of `y` (which is reached when `x = 50`) and subtracting `y` from it. This gives us the expression `50 - y`.\n\nSo, the lexicographic ranking function for the loop in this program is `(50 - y)`. \n\nThis is a valid ranking function because:\n\n- It is positive: `50 - y` is positive as long as `y` is less than or equal to 50, which is guaranteed by the loop's condition (`y >= 0`), and the fact that `y` does not increase once `x > 50`.\n- It decreases with each iteration: Once `x > 50`, `y` decreases with each iteration, which makes `50 - y` increase, making it a valid lexicographic ranking function.\n\nHere is the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant 50 - y;\n*/\n```",

Therefore, `y` can be our first ranking function. \n\nNow, let's find the second expression for our ranking function:\n\n- `x` is always increasing, and the amount by which `y` decreases is proportional to the value of `x - 50`. Hence, `50 - x` can be our second ranking function, as it is positive when `x <= 50` and decreases as `x` increases.\n\nTherefore, the lexicographic ranking function for the loop in the given program is `(y, 50 - x)`.\n\nThe ranking function is valid because `y` is positive and decreases when `x > 50`, and `50 - x` is positive when `x <= 50` and decreases as `x` increases.

A ranking function can be used to prove that a loop terminates.\nA multi-phase ranking function is a sequence of ranking functions that can be used to prove termination of a loop.\nIn a multi-phase ranking function, the first expression decreases with successive iterations of the loop, and when it becomes non-positive, the second expression decreases and so on.\nFor example, if (e1, e2, e3) is a multi-phase ranking function, we begin with e1 being positive. Once e1 becomes non-positive, we move on to e2, which decreases with every loop iteration. Once e2 becomes non-positive, we move on to e3 which decreases till it becomes non-positive and the loop terminates.\nFind the multi-phase ranking function for the loop in the following program and explain why it is a valid ranking function.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make note of the starting values or constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head.\n- Analyze the loop body and find a ranking function such that:\n    - The first expression decreases in the first iteration of the loop and continues to decrease\n    - The second expression decreases once the first expression becomes zero or negative\n    - so on... till the last expression decreases till the loop terminates.\n- Output the ranking function in one code block, in ACSL syntax, in the order they decrease, in different lines. For example,\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant v1;\n    loop variant v2;\n*/\n```\n\nRules:\n- **Do not use constants or functions not defined in the program. Use the ternary operator to describe the absolute value of an expression.**"
