Both these expressions are positive and decrease in each iteration of the loop, as required.\n\nThe lexicographic ranking function for the loop is `(100 - y, 100 + z)`. This ranking function is valid because both expressions are positive and decrease in each iteration of the loop. The first expression decreases as long as `y` is less than `100` and the second expression decreases as long as `z` is less than `100`. Thus, it ensures termination of the loop.\n\nIn ACSL syntax, the ranking function can be represented as:\n\n```C\n/*@\n    loop variant 100 - y;\n    loop variant 100 + z;\n*/\n```",
            "Firstly, we can see that the variables that are live at the loop head are `x`, `y` and `z`. All of these variables are used in the loop body, hence, their values are relevant to the loop execution.\n\nThen, we can see that in the loop body, `y` is increased by `x` and `z` is decreased by `x` in each iteration. Since `x` can be either negative or positive, `y` can either increase or decrease, and `z` can either increase or decrease too.\n\nThe loop continues as long as both `y` and `z` are less than 100. \n\nHence, we can say that the loop will terminate if `y` or `z` reach 100 or more.\n\nNow, let's find a ranking function. We can use `100-y` and `100-z` as the ranking functions. \n\nHere, `100-y` and `100-z` are positive as long as `y` and `z` are less than 100. \n\nIn the loop, if `x` is positive, `100-y` decreases (since `y` increases), and `100-z` increases (since `z` decreases). \n\nIf `x` is negative, `100-y` increases (since `y` decreases), and `100-z` decreases (since `z` increases). \n\nSo, the ranking functions `100-y` and `100-z` are valid as they are positive and one of them decreases in every loop iteration.\n\nThe lexicographic ranking function in ACSL syntax is:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant 100-y;\n    loop variant 100-z;\n*/\n```",
            "The program starts by setting `y` and `z` to unknown integers and `x` to either `1` or `-1`. Then, `x` is incremented or decremented 10 times depending on whether it's positive or negative. This means `x` will always end up as `11` or `-11`. \n\nThe loop then executes as long as both `y` and `z` are less than `100`. In each iteration, `y` is incremented by `x` and `z` is decremented by `x`. \n\nLet's start by determining the starting values or constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head. From the loop condition, we know that `y` and `z` must be less than `100` at the start of the loop. Also, the value of `x` is known to be either `11` or `-11`.\n\nThe loop body increments `y` by `x` and decrements `z` by `x`. If `x` is positive, `y` increases and `z` decreases. If `x` is negative, `y` decreases and `z` increases. In either case, the sum `y + z` remains constant. This means the loop can only terminate if either `y` or `z` reaches `100`.\n\nA possible ranking function would be `(100 - y, 100 - z)`. This is because `y` and `z` are both increasing towards `100`. If `y` does not increase, `z` must increase and vice versa. So the tuple `(100 - y, 100 - z)` is decreasing in lexicographic order.\n\nIn ACSL syntax, the ranking function could be written as:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant 100 - y;\n    loop variant 100 - z;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because it is positive and decreases at each iteration of the loop. `100 - y` decreases whenever `y` increases, and `100 - z` decreases whenever `z` increases. Furthermore, `100 - y` and `100 - z` are both positive as long as `y` and `z` are less than `100`, which is the loop condition. Therefore, this ranking function guarantees the termination of the loop.",
            "At the start of the loop, the variables that are live at the loop head are `x`, `y`, and `z`.\n\nThe loop condition checks if `y` and `z` are less than 100. The loop modifies `y` and `z` in each iteration.\n\nThe value of `x` is used to increment `y` and decrement `z`. The value of `x` is either incremented or decremented in the body of the loop and its absolute value is always greater than 1.\n\nGiven these points, we can create a lexicographic ranking function as follows:\n\n- We use `100-y` as the first expression in the ranking function. This value is always positive because `y` is less than 100 for the loop to execute. It decreases with every loop iteration because `y` is incremented by `x` in each iteration.\n\n- If `100-y` remains constant, we use `100+z` as the second expression in the ranking function. This value is always positive because `z` is less than 100 for the loop to execute. It decreases with every loop iteration because `z` is decremented by `x` in each iteration.\n\nThus, the lexicographic ranking function is `(100-y, 100+z)`.\n\nIn ACSL syntax, this is:\n\n```c\n/*@\n    loop variant 100-y;\n    loop variant 100+z;\n*/\n```\n\nThis is a valid ranking function because it satisfies the properties of a lexicographic ranking function:\n\n- Each expression is positive while the loop is executing.\n- The first expression decreases with every loop iteration, or if it remains the same, the second expression decreases. This guarantees that the loop eventually terminates.",
            "The loop in this program is:\n```\nwhile (y<100 && z<100) {\n    y = y+x;\n    z = z-x;\n}\n```\nBefore the loop `x` can be either `6` or `-10` depending on the value of `unknown_int()`.\n\nThe variables `y` and `z` are updated inside the loop. Both `y` and `z` are incremented or decremented by `x` in each iteration of the loop. The loop continues as long as both `y` and `z` are less than `100`.\n\nLet's look at the ranking function:\n\n1. For `x=6`, `y` increases by `6` in every iteration and `z` decreases by `6`. The loop continues as long as `y` and `z` are less than `100`. So the ranking function could be `(100-y, 100-z)`. Both expressions are positive and decrease in every iteration. \n\n2. For `x=-10`, `y` decreases by `10` in every iteration and `z` increases by `10`. The loop continues as long as `y` and `z` are less than `100`. So the ranking function could be `(y+100, z+100)`. Both expressions are positive and decrease in every iteration. \n\nThe final ranking function will be a combination of these two cases:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant (x>0 ? 100-y : y+100);\n    loop variant (x>0 ? 100-z : z+100);\n*/\n```\nThis ranking function guarantees the termination of the loop. The first expression `(x>0 ? 100-y : y+100)` decreases when `y` increases (for `x=6`) or `y` decreases (for `x=-10`). The second expression `(x>0 ? 100-z : z+100)` decreases when `z` decreases (for `x=6`) or `z` increases (for `x=-10`). Both expressions are always positive while the loop is executing."
