This implies that `v1` is a natural number in each iteration.\n\nThe loop body decreases `v1` by 1 when `v2` is less than `m`. If `v2` equals `m`, then `v1` remains unchanged and `v2` is reset to 0.\n\nHence, the possible ranking function is `v1*m + m - v2`.\n\nThis function is positive because `v1` and `m` are positive and `v2` is non-negative but less than `m`.\n\nOn each iteration, `v1` decreases by 1 (if `v2 < m`) or stays the same (if `v2 == m`).

If `v2 >= m`, `v2` is set to 0 and `v1` remains the same.\n\nTherefore, we can see that `v1` is always non-increasing (it either decreases or remains the same) and it is positive at the loop head. Thus, `v1` could be our first ranking function.\n\nFor the second ranking function, we can use `m - v2`. When `v1` remains the same (i.e., when `v2 >= m`), `v2` is reset to 0, which means `m - v2` increases (since `m > v2`). In the other case, when `v2 < m` and `v1` decreases, `v2` increases, which means `m - v2` decreases. However, in both cases, `m - v2` is positive at the loop head.\n\nHence, `(v1, m - v2)` is our lexicographic ranking function.\n\nHere is the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```C\n/*@\n    loop variant v1;\n    loop variant m - v2;\n*/\n```",

The variable v1 itself is a good choice, as it starts positive and strictly decreases.\n\nFor the second expression of the ranking function, we need to find an expression involving v2 that is positive when the first expression is constant, and decreases. Here, m - v2 is a good choice. When v1 is constant, v2 increases until it reaches m, so m - v2 starts positive and decreases.

This ensures that the inner loop also does not run forever.\n- When v2 reaches m, it resets to 0, making m - v2 positive again. This ensures that the loop continues to progress.\n- Therefore, the loop terminates.",
            "At the loop head, the live variables are `v1` and `v2`. The loop's termination condition is `v1 > 0`. The loop invariant is that `v1` is always non-negative and `v2` is always non-negative and less than or equal to `m`. \n\nThe loop body has two branches. In the first branch, `v2` increases and `v1` decreases, while in the second branch, `v2` resets to zero while `v1` remains the same. \n\nWe can see that `v1` decreases in the first branch, which occurs when `v2 < m`, and remains the same in the second branch, which occurs when `v2 == m`. This means that `v1` will eventually reach zero and the loop will terminate, because `v2` cannot keep increasing indefinitely and will eventually reach `m`, causing `v1` to decrease. \n\nTherefore, a lexicographic ranking function for this loop can be `(v1, m - v2)`. \n\nThe first component `v1` is always non-negative and decreases in the first branch of the loop body, which ensures that the loop will eventually terminate. \n\nThe second component `m - v2` is also always non-negative, since `v2` is always less than or equal to `m`. It decreases in the first branch of the loop body when `v2` increases, and increases in the second branch when `v2` resets to zero.

Inside the loop, `v1` is decreased by 1 only when `v2` is less than `m`, else `v2` is reset to 0. This means that `v1` decreases by 1 every `m` iterations of the loop. \n\nSo, one possible ranking function is `v1` itself. \n\nHowever, this is not enough to prove termination because `v1` is not always decreasing. When `v2` reaches `m`, `v2` is reset to 0 and `v1` is not decreased. \n\nTo handle this case, a second ranking function is needed. When `v1` is not decreasing, `v2` is decreasing from `m` to 0. So, `m - v2` can be a second ranking function.\n\nThis gives us a multi-phase ranking function: `(v1, m - v2)`. \n\nThe first expression `v1` decreases every `m` iterations of the loop and becomes non-positive when the loop terminates.\n\nThe second expression `m - v2` decreases in the iterations where the first expression does not decrease, and becomes 0 when `v2` is reset to 0. \n\nThis guarantees that in every iteration of the loop, at least one of the expressions in the multi-phase ranking function decreases, proving that the loop terminates. \n\nThe ranking function in ACSL syntax is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant v1;\n    loop variant m - v2;\n*/\n```",

Therefore, the variable `v1` is a natural candidate for the first ranking function as it immediately decreases with every iteration of the loop when `v2 < m`.\n\nWhen `v2` equals `m`, `v2` is reset to `0`, and `v1` does not decrease. This happens every `m` iterations. So, we can use `m - v2` as the second ranking function, which decreases once `v1` becomes non-positive.\n\nThe ranking function for the given program is therefore `(v1, m - v2)`. This is a valid ranking function because `v1` decreases in the first phase of the loop, and `m - v2` decreases in the second phase. \n\nThe ACSL syntax for this ranking function would be:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant v1;\n    loop variant m - v2;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function helps us prove that the loop terminates. When `v1` and `m - v2` both become non-positive, the loop condition `v1 > 0` is no longer satisfied, and the loop exits.",
            "The initial values of the variables are `v1 = n` and `v2 = 0`. \nThe loop condition is `v1 > 0`. \nInside the loop, there are two branches: \n- In the first branch, `v2` increments and `v1` decrements. \n- In the second branch, `v2` resets to `0`.\n\nWe can see that `v1` is always decreasing in the loop until it becomes `0`, and `v2` increases until it reaches `m` and then resets to `0`. \n\nTherefore, we can choose `v1` as the first expression of the ranking function and `m - v2` as the second expression. `v1` decreases with every iteration of the loop until it becomes `0`, and `m - v2` decreases every time `v2` increases and resets to `0`. \n\nFinally, when `v1` becomes `0`, the loop terminates.\n\nSo, the multi-phase ranking function is:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant v1;\n    loop variant m - v2;\n*/\n```",

When `v2 == m`, `v1` doesn't decrease, but `v2` is reset to 0.\n\nThis suggests that `v1` and `v2` could be the first and second expressions in our multi-phase ranking function. \n\n`v1` decreases in the first part of the loop until it becomes 0. After that, `v2` decreases till the loop terminates.\n\nThus, the ranking function will be `v1` and `m - v2`.\n\nThe ACSL syntax for the multi-phase ranking function is:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant v1;\n    loop variant m - v2;\n*/\n```\nThis is a valid ranking function because `v1` is always non-negative and decreases with each iteration of the loop until it becomes 0. When `v1` becomes 0, `v2` starts decreasing with each iteration of the loop until the loop terminates. This guarantees that the loop will eventually terminate.",

When `v2` reaches `m`, `v1` stops decreasing and `v2` is reset to 0. This causes `v1` to start decreasing again in the next iterations.\n\nTherefore, the multi-phase ranking function for this loop can be (v1, m-v2). `v1` decreases till it becomes non-positive. Then `m-v2` decreases till it becomes non-positive and the loop terminates.\n\nThus, in ACSL syntax, the multi-phase ranking function is:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant v1;\n    loop variant m - v2;\n*/\n```\nThis is a valid ranking function because `v1` and `m-v2` are always non-negative at the loop head, `v1` is strictly decreasing when `v2 < m`, and `m-v2` is strictly decreasing once `v1` becomes non-positive.
