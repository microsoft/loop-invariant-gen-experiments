            "In this program, three variables are live at the loop head: `x`, `y`, and `d`. The loop continues as long as `x > 0`, `y > 0`, and `d > 0`. Inside the loop, the values of `x`, `y`, and `d` can change in two ways:\n\n- If `unknown_int() != 0`, `x` is decreased by 1 and `d` gets an unknown value.\n- If `unknown_int() == 0`, `y` and `d` are decreased by 1 and `x` gets an unknown value.\n\nIt is hard to find a ranking function involving `x` and `d` due to the unknown values they can get. However, `y` is only decreased by 1 in every iteration where `unknown_int() == 0`. Therefore, `y` can be used as a ranking function because it monotonically decreases with each iteration and is always positive when the loop continues.\n\nThe ranking function for this loop is `y`. \n\nHere is how you can write it using ACSL syntax:\n\n```c\n/*@\n    loop variant y;\n*/\n```\n\nThis is a valid ranking function because `y` is always greater than 0 for the loop to continue, and it decreases in every iteration where `unknown_int() == 0`. Even though `y` does not decrease in iterations where `unknown_int() != 0`, it doesn't increase either, so it still satisfies the conditions of a ranking function.",
            "The variables live at the loop head are `x`, `y`, and `d`. \n\nLooking at the loop body, we can see that `x`, `y`, and `d` are all decreasing in value through each iteration. \n\nSo, our ranking function should involve these three variables.\n\nA possible ranking function would be `x + y + d`. This is because each iteration of the loop either `x`, `y`, or `d` decreases by at least 1, so the value of the ranking function would decrease with each iteration. \n\nAt the same time, the loop continues only when `x`, `y`, and `d` are all greater than 0, which means `x + y + d` must be positive for the loop to continue.\n\nHence, the ranking function is valid.\n\nHere is the ACSL syntax for the ranking function:\n\n```c\n/*@\n    loop variant x + y + d;\n*/\n```",
            "The variables `x`, `y`, and `d` are live at the loop head. The loop continues as long as all three variables are greater than zero. \n\nIn each iteration of the loop, at least one of the variables `x`, `y`, or `d` is decremented by 1. \n\nTherefore, a possible ranking function is the sum of `x`, `y`, and `d`. This function decreases with every loop iteration and is positive while the loop is executing. \n\nThis can be written in ACSL syntax as:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x + y + d;\n*/\n```",
            "The variables `x`, `y`, and `d` are live at the loop head. The loop condition requires `x > 0`, `y > 0` and `d > 0`. \n\nIn the loop body, `x`, `y`, and `d` can be decreased, but never increased. Therefore, any combination of `x`, `y`, and `d` can be used as a ranking function, as long as the combination decreases with every iteration and remains positive while the loop continues.\n\nThe ranking function `x + y + d` satisfies these conditions. In each iteration of the loop, either `x` decreases by 1, `y` decreases by 1, or `d` decreases by 1. Therefore, the ranking function `x + y + d` decreases by at least 1 in each iteration.\n\nThe ranking function remains positive as long as the loop continues, because `x > 0`, `y > 0`, and `d > 0` are loop conditions.\n\nSo, the ranking function for the loop in the given program is `x + y + d`. In ACSL syntax, the ranking function is represented as follows:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x + y + d;\n*/\n```\n\nThis is a valid ranking function because it decreases with every iteration of the loop and remains positive as long as the loop continues.",

In the other branch, y and d decrease by 1, but x can be any value.\n\nHence, we can say that the variables x, y, and d are live at the loop head.\n\nThe key idea to construct a ranking function is to find an expression that decreases in every loop iteration and remains positive as long as the loop continues to execute. In this case, we can create a ranking function that is the sum of the variables x, y, and d. The value of this expression will decrease with every loop iteration because either x or y and d decrease in every iteration. Also, the value of this expression will be positive as long as the loop continues to execute because the loop condition requires all of x, y, and d to be positive.\n\nSo, the ranking function for this loop is `x + y + d`.\n\nIn ACSL syntax, the loop variant for this program is:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x + y + d;\n*/\n```\nThis is a valid ranking function because it decreases with every loop iteration and remains positive as long as the loop continues to execute."

We cannot assume anything about the value returned by `unknown_int()`, but since `x` must be positive when entering the loop, it will always be non-negative.\n\n2. `y >= 0`: Similarly, since the loop condition requires `y>0`, `y` can never be negative. In the loop body, `y` is only decremented by 1, so it will always be non-negative.\n\n3. `d >= 0`: The loop condition requires `d>0`, so `d` can never be negative. In the loop body, `d` is either decremented by 1 or assigned a new value from `unknown_int()`. As with `x`, since `d` must be positive when entering the loop, it will always be non-negative.\n\n4. `\\at(y, LoopEntry) >= y`: This loop invariant states that the value of `y` at the beginning of the loop is greater than or equal to its current value.

We are not sure if `d` is decreased or not, so we cannot include `d` in our ranking function for this branch.\n\nIn the second branch, `x` is non-deterministically updated, while `y` and `d` are both decreased by one.

Therefore, y is not a good candidate for the second phase of the ranking function.\n\nThe variable d decreases by 1 in the second branch of the if statement and is non-deterministically updated in the first branch. Therefore, it is also not a good candidate for the second phase of the ranking function.\n\nHowever, if we consider the combination of the variables y and d, we can see that this combination is guaranteed to decrease with each iteration of the loop. This is because, in the first branch, x decreases and y and d remain the same. In the second branch, both y and d decrease. Therefore, the sum of y and d is a good candidate for the second phase of the ranking function.\n\nSo, the multi-phase ranking function for this loop is x for the first phase and y + d for the second phase.\n\nThe ACSL syntax for this multi-phase ranking function would be:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n    loop variant y + d;\n*/\n```\nThis is a valid multi-phase ranking function because:\n\n1. x is always positive at the start of the loop and decreases in the first branch of the if statement inside the loop.

The values of these variables are not known at the beginning of the loop since they are assigned the values of `unknown_int()`, which can be any integer. \n\nThe loop continues to iterate while `x`, `y`, and `d` are all greater than 0. Inside the loop, there is a conditional statement that determines how `x`, `y`, and `d` are updated. If `unknown_int() != 0`, `x` is decremented by 1 and `d` is assigned a new unknown integer. Otherwise, `x` is assigned a new unknown integer, `y` is decremented by 1, and `d` is decremented by 1. \n\nSince `x`, `y`, and `d` are being decremented inside the loop, it can be assumed that they will eventually become non-positive, causing the loop to terminate. \n\nLet's now find the ranking function.\n\nThe first expression in the ranking function should be a variable that is definitely decreasing with every iteration of the loop. In this case, `x` is not always decreasing because it can be assigned a new unknown integer. `d` is also not always decreasing because it too can be assigned a new unknown integer. However, `y` is always decreasing because it is decremented by 1 whenever `unknown_int() == 0`. Therefore, `y` can be the first expression in the ranking function.\n\nThe second expression should be a variable that starts decreasing once the first expression becomes non-positive. This variable can be `d` because it is decremented by 1 whenever `unknown_int() == 0` and `y` has become non-positive.\n\nTherefore, the multi-phase ranking function for this loop can be `(y, d)`. This is a valid ranking function because `y` decreases with each iteration of the loop until it becomes non-positive, at which point `d` starts decreasing until it becomes non-positive, causing the loop to terminate.\n\nThe ranking function in ACSL syntax can be represented as:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant y;\n    loop variant d;\n*/\n```",

For the second expression, we can use `y` because `y` decreases once `d` becomes zero or negative.\n\nHere is the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant d;\n    loop variant y;\n*/\n```\n\nThis is a valid ranking function because `d` decreases in every iteration of the loop, and `y` decreases once `d` becomes zero or negative, which ensures that the loop terminates."

If unknown_int() is zero, y and d decrease.\n- After the loop termination, y, d are non-positive.\n\nSo, the loop invariants are:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0 && y >= 0 && d >= 0;\n    loop invariant (unknown_int() != 0 ==> (\\at(y, LoopEntry) >= y && \\at(d, LoopEntry) >= d)) && (unknown_int() == 0 ==> (\\at(y, LoopEntry) > y && \\at(d, LoopEntry) > d));\n    loop invariant x <= 0 || y <= 0 || d <= 0;\n*/\n```",
