            "1. The starting value of `x` is unknown, but we can assume that it is an integer because it is the return value of the `unknown_int()` function.\n2. The loop condition is `x <= 100`, so the loop will continue executing as long as `x` is less than or equal to 100.\n3. Inside the loop body, `x` is updated in two different ways:\n    a. If `unknown_int()` returns a non-zero value, `x` is updated to `-2*x + 2`.\n    b. If `unknown_int()` returns zero, `x` is updated to `-3*x - 2`.\n4. In both cases, the new value of `x` is a linear combination of the old value of `x`. To ensure that the value of the ranking function is decreasing and positive, we can use the absolute value of the difference between the new and old values of `x`.\n\nThe ranking function can be:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant (x < 0) ? 100 - x : 100 + x;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because it meets the following requirements:\n\n1. It is an expression over the live variables at the loop head, i.e., `x`.\n2. It is decreasing with every iteration of the loop. If `x` is negative, it becomes more positive, and if `x` is positive, it becomes more negative.\n3. It is positive while the loop is executing, as the loop condition `x <= 100` ensures that the value of `x` is always between -100 and 100.",
            "First, we make note of the starting values or constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head. \n\nIn this case, `x` is the only live variable at the loop head, and its value is determined by an unknown integer. The loop will execute as long as `x` is less than or equal to 100.\n\nNext, we analyze the loop body and find a ranking function involving the variables in the loop body.\n\nInside the loop, there are two cases for the update of `x`:\n\n1. `x = -2 * x + 2`\n2. `x = -3 * x - 2`\n\nIn both cases, the value of `x` is updated based on its previous value. We want to find a ranking function that is decreasing with every iteration of the loop and is positive while the loop is executing.\n\nLet's consider the ranking function `v = 100 - x`. Now we analyze whether this ranking function is valid.\n\n1. Loop invariant: `x <= 100`\n2. Loop variant: `v = 100 - x`\n\nNow let's check if `v` is decreasing with every iteration of the loop:\n\n1. If `x = -2 * x + 2`, then the new value of `v` is `100 - (-2 * x + 2) = 2 * x + 98`. Since the loop invariant holds, `x <= 100`, we have `2 * x + 98 <= 2 * 100 + 98 = 298`, which means that `v` is positive. Also, since `x` is decreasing by the update rule, `v` is increasing.\n\n2. If `x = -3 * x - 2`, then the new value of `v` is `100 - (-3 * x - 2) = 3 * x + 102`. Since the loop invariant holds, `x <= 100`, we have `3 * x + 102 <= 3 * 100 + 102 = 402`, which means that `v` is positive. Also, since `x` is decreasing by the update rule, `v` is increasing.\n\nThus, the ranking function `v = 100 - x` is valid. Now, we output the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant 100 - x;\n*/\n```",
            "First, let's note the starting values or constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head. The loop variable is `x`, and its value is unknown at the beginning. However, the loop condition is `x <= 100`.\n\nNow let's analyze the loop body. There are two branches inside the loop:\n\n1. If `unknown_int()` is true, then `x` is updated to `-2 * x + 2`.\n2. If `unknown_int()` is false, then `x` is updated to `-3 * x - 2`.\n\nIn both cases, the absolute value of `x` is increasing. Therefore, we can use the expression `100 - |x|` as the ranking function, where `|x|` represents the absolute value of `x`. This expression is positive because `x <= 100` and decreases with every iteration of the loop, as the absolute value of `x` increases.\n\nHere's the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```c\n/*@\n    loop variant 100 - (x >= 0 ? x : -x);\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because it's always positive while the loop is executing and decreases with every iteration of the loop.",
            "First, we note the starting values or constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head.

In this case, we have two possible updates to `x`:\n\n1. `x = -2*x + 2;`\n2. `x = -3*x - 2;`\n\nNow, let's consider the ranking function `101 - x`. We will show that it is a valid ranking function.\n\n1. When the loop starts, `x` is an unknown integer, so the ranking function is `101 - x`. Since the loop condition is `x <= 100`, we have that `x` is between `-âˆž` and `100`. Thus, the ranking function is always positive: `0 < 101 - x <= 101`.\n\n2. In every iteration of the loop, the value of `x` is either multiplied by `-2` and increased by `2`, or multiplied by `-3` and decreased by `2`. In both cases, the value of `x` is always increasing, so the ranking function is decreasing: `101 - x_new < 101 - x_old`.\n\nTherefore, the ranking function `101 - x` is valid as it is decreasing with every iteration of the loop, and evaluates to a positive value while the loop is executing.\n\nThe loop variant in ACSL syntax is:\n\n```c\n/*@\n    loop variant 101 - x;\n*/\n```",
            "1. Make note of the starting values or constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head:\n   - The variable `x` is live at the loop head and its starting value is `unknown_int()`. Since we don't know the constraints for `unknown_int()`, we can assume `x` can be any integer value.\n\n2. Analyze the loop body and find a ranking function involving the variables in the loop body:\n   - In the loop body, `x` is updated in two different ways based on the value of `unknown_int()`. If `unknown_int()` is true, then `x` is updated to `-2 * x + 2`. If `unknown_int()` is false, then `x` is updated to `-3 * x - 2`.\n   - In both cases, the value of `x` is decreasing, which means the loop will eventually terminate when `x > 100`.\n\n3. Output the ranking function in one code block, in ACSL syntax:\n\nConsidering the loop termination condition `x > 100`, we can output the ranking function as:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant 100 - x;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because it decreases with every iteration of the loop as the value of `x` increases. The value of the ranking function is positive while the loop is executing since `x` is less than or equal to 100 in the loop."

            "We first note the starting values or constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head. Here, `x` is an unknown integer.\n\nAnalyzing the loop body, we can see that `x` is always updated to a negative value on every iteration, regardless of the branch taken. Thus, `x` is decreasing at every loop iteration.\n\nSince `x` is non-deterministic, we cannot determine the exact value it will take after the next iteration. However, we know that it will always be less than or equal to its current value, and eventually, it will be less than or equal to 100, causing the loop to terminate.\n\nTherefore, a valid ranking function for this loop is `101 - x` for the first phase. This value starts positive and decreases with every iteration of the loop until it becomes non-positive, at which point the loop terminates. \n\nThere is no need for a second phase in the ranking function because once `101 - x` becomes non-positive, the loop terminates.\n\nSo, the ranking function in ACSL syntax will be:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant 101 - x;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid as it guarantees that the loop will terminate. The expression `101 - x` starts positive and decreases with every loop iteration until it becomes non-positive, at which point the loop terminates.",
            "First, let's note the variables that are live at the loop head. In this case, it's only `x`.\n\nNext, let's analyze the loop. `x` is updated in each iteration of the loop, either being multiplied by -2 and incremented by 2, or being multiplied by -3 and decremented by 2. This means that the value of `x` will always increase by at least 2 in each iteration of the loop, regardless of its initial value.\n\nSo, a simple ranking function for this loop would be `100 - x`. This value starts as a non-negative value (since `x` is at most 100) and decreases in each loop iteration. When `x` exceeds 100, the loop terminates, and `100 - x` becomes negative.\n\nTherefore, the ranking function for this loop is `100 - x`. \n\nIn ACSL syntax, it would be written as:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant 100 - x;\n*/\n```\nThis is a valid ranking function because it starts as a non-negative value and strictly decreases in each iteration of the loop until the loop terminates.",
            "1. The variable live at the loop head is `x`.\n2. `x` is non-deterministic at the start of the loop.\n3. In the loop body, `x` is updated to `-2*x + 2` or `-3*x - 2` non-deterministically.\n4. Both `-2*x + 2` and `-3*x - 2` are decreasing functions when `x > 0`.\n5. The loop condition `x <= 100` ensures that the loop will not terminate as long as `x` is less than or equal to 100.\n\nBased on these observations, we can select `100 - x` as the first expression of our ranking function. When `x > 0`, `100 - x` is positive and it decreases with every loop iteration. Once `x` becomes greater than 100, `100 - x` becomes non-positive.\n\nWe can select `x` as the second expression of our ranking function. Once `x` becomes greater than 100, `x` starts to decrease with every loop iteration, and the loop terminates once `x` becomes non-positive.\n\nSo, the ranking function is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant 100 - x;\n    loop variant x;\n*/\n```\n\nThis is a valid ranking function because:\n- The first expression `100 - x` is positive and decreases with every loop iteration as long as `x > 0`.\n- Once `x` becomes greater than 100, `100 - x` becomes non-positive and `x` starts to decrease with every loop iteration.\n- The loop terminates once `x` becomes non-positive.",
            "The program has a non-deterministic loop that updates the variable `x` either by `x = -2*x + 2` or `x = -3*x - 2`. In both cases, the value of `x` is being multiplied by a negative number and then subtracted by a positive number, which means `x` is decreasing after each iteration. Thus, `x` can be used as the ranking function.\n\nHere is the multi-phase ranking function for the given program:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n*/\n```\nThis is a valid ranking function because `x` is decreasing in every iteration of the loop until it is less than or equal to 100, at which point the loop terminates.",
            "The given program has an unknown initial value for x, and in the loop, the value of x is updated based on the return value of `unknown_int()`. In each iteration, x is multiplied by either -2 or -3 and then added by 2 or subtracted by 2 respectively. \n\nIf `unknown_int()` returns a non-zero value, x is updated by `x = -2*x + 2`. If `unknown_int()` returns zero, x is updated by `x = -3*x - 2`. Regardless of the return value of `unknown_int()`, x is decreasing in every iteration of the loop.\n\nLet's take (101 - x) as our first ranking function. At the beginning of the loop, x is less than or equal to 100, so 101 - x is a positive number. With each iteration of the loop, x increases, so (101 - x) decreases.\n\nHowever, once (101 - x) becomes non-positive (which means x > 100), we need to find another ranking function that continues to decrease. \n\nWe can see that the smallest increase of x in each iteration is 2 (when x is multiplied by -2 and then added by 2), so let's take (2x - 202) as our second ranking function. \n\nThis ranking function decreases in each iteration of the loop (since x is increased by at least 2 in each iteration) and becomes non-positive when x > 101.\n\nTherefore, the multi-phase ranking function is:\n\n```c\n/*@\n    loop variant 101 - x;\n    loop variant 2*x - 202;\n*/\n```\n\nThis is a valid ranking function because it guarantees that the loop terminates.
