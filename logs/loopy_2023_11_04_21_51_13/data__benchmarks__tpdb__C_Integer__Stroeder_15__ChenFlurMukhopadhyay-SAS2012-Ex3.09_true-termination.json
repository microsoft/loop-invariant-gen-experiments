Since `x` must be greater than 0 and less than `y` for the loop to continue, and `x > 2*oldx` in each iteration, we can consider the following expression as a ranking function:\n\n```\n(y - x)\n```\n\nThis expression is valid because it decreases with each iteration (as `x` becomes closer to `y`), and it is positive while the loop is executing (since `x < y`).

The value of `y - x` is positive as long as the loop is executing, since `x < y` is one of the loop conditions.\n2.

However, we can observe that x must be strictly greater than 2*oldx for the loop to continue. This fact allows us to construct a ranking function that is decreasing with each iteration.\n\nThe ranking function for this loop can be expressed as:\n```\ny - x\n```\n\nThis is a valid ranking function for the following reasons:\n\n1. It decreases with each iteration: Since x is strictly greater than 2*oldx and y is set to z (which remains constant) in each iteration, the difference between y and x (i.e., y - x) will decrease with each iteration.\n\n2.

The loop body updates `oldx` to `x`, `x` to an unknown integer, and `y` to `z`. \n\n4. The lexicographic ranking function should involve `x`, `y`, `z`, and `oldx` in some way such that the first expression decreases with every iteration of the loop, and evaluates to a positive value while the loop is executing. \n\n5. Since `x` is strictly less than `y`, `y - x` is a valid ranking function. \n\n6. If `x` remains constant, `y` decreases as `y` is updated to `z`.

In each iteration, `oldx` is updated to the value of `x`, and `x` is assigned a new non-deterministic value. The loop continues while `x` is greater than 0, less than `y`, and more than double the value of `oldx`. Since `x` must be more than double the value of `oldx`, we can choose `x - 2*oldx` as the first expression of the ranking function.\n\nStep 3: Find a ranking function such that the second expression decreases once the first expression becomes zero or negative.\nWhen `x - 2*oldx` becomes non-positive, it means `x <= 2*oldx`. At this point, the loop continues as long as `x > 0` and `x < y`. Since `x` is non-deterministically updated, we can't guarantee that it will decrease in every iteration. However, `y` is updated to the value of `z`, which remains constant throughout the loop. So, we can choose `y - x` as the second expression of the ranking function.\n\nNow, we have the multi-phase ranking function `(x - 2*oldx, y - x)`.\n\nFinally, we can output the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```c\n/*@\n    loop variant x - 2*oldx;\n    loop variant y - x;\n*/\n```",

The first expression should immediately decrease with every iteration of the loop. In this case, we can choose `x - 2*oldx` as the first expression, because the loop condition guarantees that `x > 2*oldx`. This expression will decrease with each iteration until it becomes non-positive.\n\n2. The second expression should decrease once the first expression becomes zero or negative. We can choose `y - x` as the second expression. When `x - 2*oldx` becomes non-positive, it means that `x <= 2*oldx`. Since `x < y` from the loop condition, this ensures that `y - x` is positive. As the loop progresses, `y` is updated to `z`, which does not change within the loop, and `x` is updated to a new unknown value. Therefore, `y - x` will decrease with each iteration until it becomes non-positive and the loop terminates.\n\nThe multi-phase ranking function is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x - 2*oldx;\n    loop variant y - x;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because it satisfies the conditions for a multi-phase ranking function: the first expression decreases with each iteration until it becomes non-positive, and the second expression decreases once the first expression becomes non-positive, eventually leading to loop termination.",

The first expression should decrease with successive iterations of the loop. We can see that `x` decreases when it is updated with `unknown_int()` and the loop condition `x > 2*oldx` ensures that the new value of `x` is larger than the double of the old value of `x`. So, we can choose `y - x` as the first expression.\n\n2. Once the first expression becomes non-positive (`y - x <= 0`), the second expression should decrease with successive iterations of the loop. In this case, we can choose `x` as the second expression, since when the first expression becomes non-positive, the loop condition `x < y` is no longer satisfied, and `x` starts to decrease.\n\nTherefore, the multi-phase ranking function for the loop is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant y - x;\n    loop variant x;\n*/\n```\n\nThis is a valid ranking function because:\n- The first expression, `y - x`, decreases with every iteration of the loop when the loop condition is satisfied.\n- Once the first expression becomes non-positive, the second expression, `x`, starts to decrease with every iteration of the loop.\n- The loop terminates when both expressions become non-positive, and the loop conditions `x > 0`, `x < y`, and `x > 2*oldx` are no longer satisfied.",

The first expression should decrease with every iteration of the loop. We can choose `x` as the first expression since it is part of the loop condition, and it is updated with an unknown value in the loop body. We know that `x` will decrease because `x > 2*oldx` is part of the loop condition.\n\n2. For the second expression, we need to find an expression that decreases once the first expression becomes non-positive. In this case, we can choose `y - x` as the second expression. This is because once `x` becomes non-positive or reaches a value where `x <= 2*oldx`, the loop will continue to execute only if `x < y`. During these iterations, `y` is being updated to `z` which remains constant. As a result, the value of `y - x` will decrease with each iteration until the loop terminates.\n\nSo, the multi-phase ranking function for this loop is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n    loop variant y - x;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because the expressions decrease with every iteration of the loop, ensuring termination.

So, in the next iteration, the new value of x will be less than the old value of x.\n\nThe second ranking function can be the difference between `y` and `x` since once `x` becomes non-positive, `x < y` will no longer hold true, which means the loop will terminate.\n\nSo, the multi-phase ranking function for the given loop is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n    loop variant y - x;\n*/\n```\n\nThis is a valid ranking function because:\n\n1. `x` decreases with every iteration of the loop, as required by the loop condition `x > 2 * oldx`.\n2.
