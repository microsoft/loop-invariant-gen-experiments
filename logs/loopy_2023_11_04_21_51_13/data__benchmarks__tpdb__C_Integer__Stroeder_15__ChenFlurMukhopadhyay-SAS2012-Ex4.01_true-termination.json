The value of `x` is updated to `2*x + y`, `y` is updated to `z`, and `z` is incremented by 1. \n\nWe can see that `x` is always increasing or staying the same during the loop execution, and we know that `x` is always less than or equal to `n` as per the loop condition. This suggests that `n - x` could be a potential expression for our ranking function.

So, `-y` is positive and decreases in each iteration. \n\nThe third expression could be `-z` because `z` increases in each iteration.

Here's why:\n\n- `n - x` is positive and decreases as `x` increases with each iteration. When `x` exceeds `n`, the loop terminates.\n- If `n - x` remains the same (which it can't in this loop), `-y` would be positive and decreases as `y` is replaced with `z` in each iteration. However, given the loop condition and updates, `n - x` can't remain constant, so this part of the ranking function doesn't contribute to proving termination.\n- If `n - x` and `-y` both remain constant (which they can't), `-z` would be positive and decreases as `z` is incremented.

In this case, those are `x`, `y`, and `z`. \n\nNow let's look at how these variables change within the loop body:\n1. `x` is updated to `2*x + y`\n2. `y` is updated to `z`\n3. `z` is updated to `z + 1`\n\nWe need to find expressions that decrease with successive iterations of the loop.\n\nFor the first expression, we can choose `n - x` as it decreases with every iteration of the loop since `x` is updated to `2*x + y` and the loop condition `x <= n` ensures that `n - x` is initially positive. \n\nOnce `n - x` becomes non-positive, we need to find a second expression that decreases with successive iterations of the loop. In this case, we can use `-y` as the second expression since it decreases with every iteration after the first expression becomes non-positive. This is because, in the loop, `y` is updated to `z`, and `z` is always increasing (`z = z + 1`).

The loop condition is (x + y >= 0 && x <= n), which means the loop continues as long as x + y is non-negative and x is less than or equal to n.\n2. Inside the loop, x is updated to (2 * x + y), y is updated to z, and z is incremented by 1.\n\nConsidering these updates, we can find a multi-phase ranking function as follows:\n\n1. The first expression in the ranking function can be (n - x), as x is incremented in the loop, and the loop terminates when x becomes greater than n. So, (n - x) decreases with successive iterations of the loop.\n2. The second expression can be (x + y), as the loop condition requires x + y to be non-negative, and it will decrease with successive iterations of the loop.
