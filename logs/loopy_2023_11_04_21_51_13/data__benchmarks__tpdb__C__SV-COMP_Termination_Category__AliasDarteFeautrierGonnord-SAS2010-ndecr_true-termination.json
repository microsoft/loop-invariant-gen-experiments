This is because `i` is always positive during the execution of the loop (as the loop continues only while `i > 1`). Also, `i` is decreasing with every iteration of the loop (as `i` is decremented by 1 in each iteration).\n\nTherefore, the ranking function for the loop in the given program is `i`.\n\nIn ACSL syntax, the ranking function is specified as follows:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant i;\n*/\n```",

The loop variant `i` starts from `n - 1` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 1. \n\nThis ranking function is valid because:\n- It is initialized to a non-negative value (`n - 1`).\n- It is decreased in every iteration of the loop (`i--`).\n- The loop continues as long as the ranking function `i` is greater than 1 (`while (i > 1)`).\n\nSo, the ranking function for this loop is `i`.\n\nIn ACSL syntax, the loop variant can be defined as follows:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant i;\n*/\n```",
