As long as `y` and `z` remain less than `100`, the loop will continue to execute. The ranking function guarantees that the loop will eventually terminate because its value decreases with each iteration and it is always positive during the execution of the loop.",

In every iteration of the loop, `y` is incremented by `x` and `z` is decremented by `x`.\n\nLet's consider the absolute value of `x` to be `a`. Then, `a` is either 1 or 9 because of the `if` statements before the loop. \n\nIn each loop iteration, the sum of `y` and `z` decreases by `2*a`. Hence, the sum `y + z` can be used as a loop variant. \n\nThe loop variant must be positive for the loop to continue executing and it must decrease with every loop iteration. Given that `y` and `z` are both less than 100, `y + z` is positive. And, since `y + z` decreases by `2*a` with every iteration, it is a valid ranking function.\n\nSo, the ranking function is `y + z`, which can be expressed in ACSL as:\n\n```c\n/*@\n    loop variant y + z;\n*/\n```\nThis ranking function ensures that the loop must terminate because its value is always decreasing and positive during the loop execution.",

The loop continues as long as both `y` and `z` are less than 100. \n\nThe ranking function here can be `100 - y` when `x > 0` and `100 + z` when `x < 0`.

At the start of each loop iteration, the value of this function is positive because y and z are both less than 100. As the loop executes, y increases and z decreases, which means the value of `100 - y - z` decreases with each iteration. This makes it a valid ranking function.\n\nThe ACSL syntax is as follows:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant 100 - y - z;\n*/\n```",

This means that the loop will stop if either `y` reaches 100 or `z` reaches -100.\n\nNotice that the value of `x` is determined by the repeated if-else statements before the loop, where `x` is incremented if it is positive and decremented if it is negative. This means that `x` will always be either 10 or -10, depending on the result of `unknown_int()`. \n\nAs such, we can determine that the loop will always terminate because either `y` will reach or exceed 100 or `z` will reach or fall below -100.\n\nThe ranking function for this loop would be the distance `y` and `z` have to travel before the loop terminates. As such, the ranking function could be `100 - y` when `x` is positive and `z + 100` when `x` is negative.\n\nIn ACSL syntax, this would be:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant (x > 0 ? 100 - y : z + 100);\n*/\n```"

In each iteration, `y` is incremented by `x` and `z` is decremented by `x`.\n\nLet's analyze this loop to find the ranking function.\n\nFirstly, observe that `x` is either `1` or `-1`. This variable is not modified inside the loop, so its value remains constant during all the iterations of the loop.\n\nThis means that `y` is incremented and `z` is decremented by `1` or `-1` in each iteration, which implies that `y` and `z` are changing in opposite directions. \n\nIf `x` is `1`, `y` is increasing and `z` is decreasing. If `x` is `-1`, `y` is decreasing and `z` is increasing. \n\nWe can state that `100 - y` and `100 - z` are positive and decrease after each iteration. \n\nThe ranking function for this loop is `(100 - y, 100 - z)`. \n\nThis is a valid lexicographic ranking function because:\n\n- `(100 - y)` is always positive and decreases after each iteration when `x` is `1`.\n- If `(100 - y)` remains the same, then `(100 - z)` is always positive and decreases after each iteration when `x` is `-1`.\n\nSo, we can output the ranking function as:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant 100 - y;\n    loop variant 100 - z;\n*/\n```\nWe can conclude that this loop terminates because the lexicographic ranking function always decreases and is always positive.",
            "Firstly, note that the loop guard is `y<100 && z<100`. This means that both `y` and `z` must be less than 100 for the loop to continue.\n\nLet's break down the loop body:\n```\ny = y+x;\nz = z-x;\n```\nSince `x` can be either positive or negative, `y` can either increase or decrease, and `z` can either decrease or increase.\n\nNow, let's think about a ranking function. We need an expression that always decreases during each iteration of the loop.\n\nConsider the two conditions `y<100` and `z<100`. These ensure that `y` and `z` are always less than 100. Therefore, the expressions `100-y` and `100-z` will always be positive when the loop is executing, and they will decrease in each iteration.\n\nSince `y` and `z` are updated in each iteration, they do not remain constant. Therefore, a lexicographic ranking function is not necessary. The ranking function can simply be `(100-y, 100-z)`.\n\nSo, the lexicographic ranking function for the loop in the program is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant 100-y;\n    loop variant 100-z;\n*/\n```\nThis is a valid ranking function because:\n- The first expression, `100-y`, is positive while the loop is executing and decreases in each iteration.\n- The second expression, `100-z`, is positive while the loop is executing and decreases in each iteration.\n\nTherefore, the loop terminates.",

For the first expression, we need to find something that decreases with each loop iteration. Since `y` is increasing, `100-y` is a good candidate for the first expression, because it decreases as `y` increases. \n\nSimilarly, since `z` is decreasing, `z+100` decreases as `z` decreases and thus can be a good candidate for the second expression.\n\nHere is the lexicographic ranking function for this loop in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant 100 - y;\n    loop variant z + 100;\n*/\n```\n\nBoth expressions are positive and decrease with each loop iteration, and therefore, the function is a valid ranking function.",

Looking at the loop body, `y` is increased by `x` and `z` is decreased by `x` on every iteration. \n\nSince `x` can be either positive or negative, `y` and `z` can either increase or decrease. However, the loop condition guarantees that `y` will not exceed 100 and `z` will not go below -100. \n\nTherefore, we can use `100 - y` and `z + 100` as our ranking functions. Both are guaranteed to decrease on every iteration of the loop and will always be positive as long as the loop continues to execute.\n\nThis gives us the following lexicographic ranking function:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant 100 - y;\n    loop variant z + 100;\n*/\n```\n\nThis is a valid ranking function because it satisfies all the required conditions.

So, this expression will decrease in every iteration and will be positive as long as `y` is less than 100, which is a condition for the loop to continue executing.\n\nThe second expression of our ranking function is `z + 100`, because `z` is decreasing and it's lower bound is -100 (since it decreases by `x` and `x` can be at most -1).

The loop condition is `y<100 && z<100`, which means the loop will terminate when either `y` reaches 100 or `z` reaches 100.

For each iteration, either `100-y` decreases or if it remains the same, `100-z` decreases. \n\nNow let's think about the loop invariants. Firstly, since `y` is increased by `x` in each iteration, and `x` can be either positive or negative, `y` will either increase or decrease by `x` in each iteration. Similarly, `z` will either increase or decrease by `x` in each iteration.\n\nNext, since the loop terminates when either `y` reaches 100 or `z` reaches 100, we can infer that `y` will always be less than 100 and `z` will always be less than 100 during the loop execution. \n\nWith these observations, we can output the loop invariants as follows:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant y <= 100;\n    loop invariant z <= 100;\n    loop invariant \\at(y, LoopEntry) + x == y;\n    loop invariant \\at(z, LoopEntry) - x == z;\n*/\n```",

The value of `x` is non-deterministic, but it is always either 2 or -2 based on the condition of `unknown_int()`.\n\nIn the loop, `y` is incremented by `x` and `z` is decremented by `x` in each iteration. The loop continues as long as both `y` and `z` are less than 100. \n\nWe can choose `100 - y` as our first expression in the ranking function. This is because `y` is incremented by `x` in each iteration, so `100 - y` would decrease with each iteration. When `y` reaches 100, `100 - y` becomes 0 and we move on to the next expression in our ranking function.\n\nWe can choose `100 - z` as our second expression. This is because `z` is decremented by `x` in each iteration, so `100 - z` would decrease with each iteration once `100 - y` is non-positive.\n\nTherefore, the multi-phase ranking function is `(100 - y, 100 - z)`. It is a valid ranking function because both expressions are positive initially and decrease with each iteration of the loop until they become non-positive.\n\nIn ACSL syntax, this can be represented as:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant 100 - y;\n    loop variant 100 - z;\n*/\n```",
            "The variable `x` is not updated inside the loop, so its value will remain constant during all the iterations. The values of `y` and `z` are updated in every iteration. In each iteration, `y` is increased by `x` and `z` is decreased by `x`. \n\nSince `x` could be positive or negative, the loop termination condition `y<100 && z<100` could be reached by either `y` becoming 100 or more, or `z` becoming 100 or more. \n\nNow let's find the ranking functions. \n\n1. If `x` is positive, `y` is increasing in every iteration. So, `100-y` is a good candidate for a ranking function since it is positive at the start of the loop and decreases with every iteration until it becomes 0, at which point the loop terminates.\n\n2. If `x` is negative, `z` is increasing in every iteration. So, `100-z` is a good candidate for a ranking function since it is positive at the start of the loop and decreases with every iteration until it becomes 0, at which point the loop terminates.\n\nTherefore, the multi-phase ranking function for this loop is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant (x > 0) ? (100-y) : 0;\n    loop variant (x < 0) ? (100-z) : 0;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because, depending on the sign of `x`, one of the expressions decreases in every iteration of the loop until it becomes non-positive, at which point the loop terminates.",
            "Firstly, let's note the initial conditions and constraints for the variables live at the loop head. Those are `x`, `y`, and `z`. As for the initial conditions, `x` is either 1 or -1 and then gets incremented or decremented 9 times depending on the sign, so `x` can be either 10 or -10. `y` and `z` are non-deterministic.\n\nThen let's analyze the loop body. `y` gets incremented by `x` and `z` gets decremented by `x` in each iteration. The loop continues until either `y` or `z` reaches 100.\n\nFor the first expression in the ranking function, we can choose `100 - y` if `x > 0` or `100 - z` if `x < 0`. This expression will decrease in each iteration of the loop if `x > 0` or `x < 0`, respectively.\n\nFor the second expression in the ranking function, we can choose `100 - z` if `x > 0` or `100 - y` if `x < 0`. This expression will start to decrease when the first expression becomes non-positive, i.e., when `y` reaches 100 if `x > 0` or when `z` reaches 100 if `x < 0`.\n\nThis ranking function guarantees that the loop will terminate because `y` and `z` are always moving towards 100 and at least one of them will reach 100 in finite iterations.\n\nHere is the multi-phase ranking function:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant (x > 0) ? 100 - y : 100 - z;\n    loop variant (x > 0) ? 100 - z : 100 - y;\n*/\n```",
            "In the given program, the variables y and z are updated non-deterministically. The variable x is either 1 or -1, and it is incremented or decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. The loop continues until both y and z are less than 100.\n\nThe first expression in the multi-phase ranking function could be (100 - y) when x > 0, and (100 - z) when x < 0. This is because y is incremented by x in each iteration, so (100 - y) decreases by x (which is 1) in each iteration when x is positive. Similarly, z is decremented by x in each iteration, so (100 - z) decreases by -x (which is also 1) in each iteration when x is negative.\n\nOnce y reaches 100, or in other words, when (100 - y) becomes non-positive, we can move on to the second expression in the multi-phase ranking function, which could be (100 - z) when x > 0, and (100 - y) when x < 0. This is because z is incremented by -x in each iteration, so (100 - z) decreases by -x (which is 1) in each iteration when x is positive. Similarly, y is decremented by x in each iteration, so (100 - y) decreases by x (which is also 1) in each iteration when x is negative.\n\nThe loop terminates when both y and z are not less than 100, or in other words, when both (100 - y) and (100 - z) become non-positive.\n\nTherefore, the multi-phase ranking function for the loop in this program, in ACSL syntax, is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant (x > 0 ? 100 - y : 100 - z);\n    loop variant (x > 0 ? 100 - z : 100 - y);\n*/\n```\n\nThis multi-phase ranking function is valid because it decreases with each iteration of the loop, and eventually becomes non-positive, at which point the loop terminates.",
            "First, we have to identify the variables that are live at the loop head. Here, the variables are `x`, `y`, and `z`.\n\nNext, we analyze the loop body. The loop condition is `y<100 && z<100`, so the loop continues as long as both `y` and `z` are less than 100.\n\nIn the loop body, `y` is incremented by `x` and `z` is decremented by `x`. Therefore, `y` is increasing and `z` is decreasing. If `x` is positive, then `y` is increasing and `z` is decreasing. If `x` is negative, then `y` is decreasing and `z` is increasing.\n\nThe loop ends when either `y` or `z` is greater than or equal to 100.\n\nSo, we can choose `100 - y` and `100 - z` as the ranking functions. These expressions decrease with every loop iteration. When `y` reaches 100, `100 - y` becomes non-positive and we move on to `100 - z`.\n\nTherefore, the multi-phase ranking function for this loop is `(100 - y, 100 - z)`. This ranking function is valid because it ensures that the loop terminates.\n\nIn ACSL syntax, the ranking functions would be written as:\n\n```c\n/*@\n    loop variant 100 - y;\n    loop variant 100 - z;\n*/\n``` \n\nThese ranking functions show that the loop will terminate because `y` and `z` are bounded by 100 and they are changing in every loop iteration."

This function decreases in each iteration of the loop because either y increases or z decreases, depending on the value of x.\n\nLet's consider the constraints on the variables before the loop starts. x is either 1 or -1 at the start of the program, and then it is incremented or decremented 9 times based on its value, which makes it 10 or -10. y and z are non-deterministic but they are less than 100 during the loop execution.\n\nNow, let's find the loop invariants that hold before the loop starts, during every iteration of the loop, and after the loop terminates. The loop invariants will support the validity of the ranking function and prove the termination of the loop.\n\nBefore the loop starts:\n- x is either 10 or -10.\n\nDuring every iteration of the loop:\n- y is less than or equal to 100.\n- z is less than or equal to 100.\n- If x is positive, y is increasing.\n- If x is negative, z is decreasing.\n\nAfter the loop terminates:\n- Either y or z is at least 100.\n\nHere are the loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x == 10 || x == -10;\n    loop invariant y <= 100;\n    loop invariant z <= 100;\n    loop invariant x > 0 ==> y >= \\at(y, LoopEntry) + x;\n    loop invariant x < 0 ==> z <= \\at(z, LoopEntry) - x;\n*/\n```\n\nThe last two invariants ensure that the ranking function decreases in every iteration of the loop, as they guarantee that either y increases (if x is positive) or z decreases (if x is negative).",
                    "The loop invariants are:\n\n```c\n/*@ \n    loop invariant y <= 100;\n    loop invariant z <= 100;\n    loop invariant \\at(x, LoopEntry) == x;\n    loop invariant x == 1 ==> y <= z;\n    loop invariant x == -1 ==> z <= y;\n    loop invariant x == 1 ==> \\at(y, LoopEntry) <= y <= \\at(y, LoopEntry) + 10;\n    loop invariant x == -1 ==> \\at(z, LoopEntry) <= z <= \\at(z, LoopEntry) + 10;\n    loop invariant y + z == \\at(y, LoopEntry) + \\at(z, LoopEntry);\n*/\n```\n\nHere are how these invariants support the loop variant and prove termination:\n\n- `y <= 100` and `z <= 100` ensure that `y` and `z` can't grow indefinitely. They will either reach 100 or surpass it, causing the loop to terminate.\n- `\\at(x, LoopEntry) == x` ensures that `x` doesn't change during the loop, which is necessary for the loop variant to be well-defined.\n- `x == 1 ==> y <= z` and `x == -1 ==> z <= y` ensure that the variable being subtracted from 100 in the loop variant is always less than or equal to the other one. This guarantees that the first component of the loop variant decreases with every iteration.\n- `x == 1 ==> \\at(y, LoopEntry) <= y <= \\at(y, LoopEntry) + 10` and `x == -1 ==> \\at(z, LoopEntry) <= z <= \\at(z, LoopEntry) + 10` ensure that `y` and `z` can't decrease indefinitely. They will either reach `\\at(y, LoopEntry) - 10` or `\\at(z, LoopEntry) - 10`, causing the loop to terminate.\n- `y + z == \\at(y, LoopEntry) + \\at(z, LoopEntry)` ensures that the sum of `y` and `z` remains constant throughout the loop. This is necessary for the second component of the loop variant to decrease with every iteration."

                    "In this given program, the variables 'x', 'y', and 'z' are live at the loop head.\n\nAt the beginning, 'x' is assigned a value of either 1 or -1 based on the result of unknown_int() function. Then, inside each if-else block, 'x' is either incremented or decremented based on its value. So, 'x' will always have a value of either 2 or -2, and it remains constant throughout the loop. \n\nThe loop condition is (y < 100 && z < 100), and the ranking function is given as ((x > 0 ? 100 - y : 100 - z), (x > 0 ? 100 - z : 100 - y)).\n\nLet's now find the loop invariants:\n\n1. Loop invariant before the loop execution: Here, the loop hasn't started yet. Hence, the invariants are the initial conditions for 'x', 'y', and 'z'.\n2. Loop invariant in every iteration of the loop: In every iteration, 'y' is incremented by 'x' and 'z' is decremented by 'x'. So, if 'x' > 0, 'y' increases and 'z' decreases. If 'x' < 0, 'y' decreases and 'z' increases.\n3. Loop invariant after the loop termination: After the loop terminates, either 'y' >= 100 or 'z' >= 100.\n\nSo, the loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant \\at(x, LoopEntry) == 2 || \\at(x, LoopEntry) == -2;\n    loop invariant x > 0 ==> y <= 100 && z >= 0;\n    loop invariant x < 0 ==> y >= 0 && z <= 100;\n    loop invariant \\at(y, LoopEntry) <= 100 && \\at(z, LoopEntry) <= 100;\n*/\n```\nThese loop invariants imply that the ranking function decreases with every iteration."
