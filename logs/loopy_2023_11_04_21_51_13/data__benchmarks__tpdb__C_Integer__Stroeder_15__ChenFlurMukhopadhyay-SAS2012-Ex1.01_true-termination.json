In each iteration, the value of `x` is updated as `x = -2*x + 10`. We need to find a multi-phase ranking function such that the first expression decreases in the first iteration of the loop and continues to decrease, and the second expression decreases once the first expression becomes zero or negative, and so on.\n\nThe first expression we can choose for the ranking function is `x`. This is because it immediately decreases with every iteration of the loop as long as `x > 0`. For example, if `x = 5`, in the first iteration, `x` becomes `-2 * 5 + 10 = -10 + 10 = 0`. Therefore, the first expression `x` decreases with successive iterations of the loop.\n\nNow, we need to find a second expression that decreases once the first expression becomes zero or negative. Since the loop terminates when `x <= 0`, we can choose the second expression as `-x`. This is because once `x` becomes non-positive, `-x` will be a positive value that decreases with successive iterations of the loop. For example, if `x = -5`, `-x` will be `5`. In the next iteration, `x` will become `-2 * (-5) + 10 = 10 + 10 = 20`, and `-x` will be `-20`.\n\nThus, the multi-phase ranking function for the given loop is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n    loop variant -x;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because the first expression `x` decreases with successive iterations of the loop while `x > 0`, and the second expression `-x` decreases once the first expression becomes non-positive, until the loop terminates.",

In each iteration, x is updated with the expression -2*x + 10.

This expression decreases with every loop iteration until it becomes non-positive.\n\nNow let's find a second expression that decreases once x becomes non-positive. Observe that when x becomes non-positive, it must have been updated from a positive value in the previous iteration. If we look at the update expression -2*x + 10, we can see that the expression 2*x - 10 will always decrease for non-positive x values. Therefore, we can choose the second expression of the ranking function to be (2*x - 10).\n\nCombining these two expressions, we get the following multi-phase ranking function:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n    loop variant 2*x - 10;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because the first expression (x) decreases with successive iterations of the loop until it becomes non-positive.
