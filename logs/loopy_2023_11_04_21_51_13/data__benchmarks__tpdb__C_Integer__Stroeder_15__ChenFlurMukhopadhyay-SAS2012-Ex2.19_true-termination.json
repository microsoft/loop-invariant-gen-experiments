If `y` were negative, the first expression would decrease, and it would not remain the same.\n4. The second expression, `x`, also decreases with each iteration since it is decremented by 1.\n\nThus, the lexicographic ranking function `(x + y, x)` is valid for this loop.",

In every iteration, y is multiplied by -2. Since x is decreased by 1 in every iteration, y is multiplied by 2 for every 2 iterations. Therefore, y is equal to its initial value multiplied by the power of 2 corresponding to the number of times it was multiplied by 2, which is half the number of iterations where x was decreased.\n4. This loop invariant is similar to the previous one but ensures that y is greater than or equal to its initial value multiplied by the power of 2 corresponding to the number of times it was multiplied by 2 in the next iteration, ensuring that y decreases when x remains the same in consecutive iterations.",

Since `x` decreases by 1 in each iteration, we can consider `x` as the first part of our ranking function.\n\nThe condition for the loop to continue is `x + y > 0`. Given that `y` is multiplied by -2 in each iteration, `y` will flip its sign and double its absolute value each time. The absolute value of `y` will increase, but when `x` becomes non-positive, the sign of `y` will determine whether the loop continues or not. Therefore, we can consider the absolute value of `y` as the second part of our ranking function.\n\nThe resulting multi-phase ranking function is therefore `x` and `y` (absolute value). So, we have:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n    loop variant y < 0 ? -y : y;\n*/\n```\n\nThis is a valid ranking function because `x` decreases in each iteration until it becomes non-positive.

            "First, let's note the variables that are live at the loop head. Those are `x` and `y`.\n\nThe loop condition is `x + y > 0`. This means that the loop continues as long as the sum of `x` and `y` is greater than zero.\n\nInside the loop, `x` is decremented by 1 and `y` is multiplied by -2.\n\nFrom this, we can see that `x` is always decreasing, but `y` is not always decreasing; it's value oscillates. However, the absolute value of `y` is increasing.\n\nBased on this, we can form two ranking functions:\n\n1. The first ranking function is `x`. It's always decreasing in every iteration of the loop until it becomes non-positive.\n2. The second ranking function is `y`'s absolute value, which starts decreasing once `x` becomes non-positive. We can express the absolute value of `y` as `(y >= 0) ? y : -y`.\n\nTherefore, the multi-phase ranking function is `(x, (y >= 0) ? y : -y)`.\n\nThis is a valid multi-phase ranking function because `x` decreases in each loop iteration until it becomes non-positive, at which point the absolute value of `y` starts decreasing. When both `x` and `y` are non-positive, the loop condition `x + y > 0` is no longer met, and the loop terminates.\n\nHere is the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n    loop variant (y >= 0) ? y : -y;\n*/\n```",

The loop continues as long as `x + y` is greater than 0.\n\nThus, the first expression of our multi-phase ranking function could be `x + y`. This expression is positive at the start (as per the loop condition) and decreases with each iteration of the loop (since `x` is decreased and `y` is multiplied by -2).\n\nHowever, once `x + y` becomes non-positive, we need to move to the second expression of our multi-phase ranking function. `y` continues to decrease (since it is multiplied by -2 in each iteration), so the second expression could be `y`.\n\nSo, the multi-phase ranking function for this loop is `(x + y, y)`, and the ACSL syntax would be:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x + y;\n    loop variant y;\n*/\n```\nThis is a valid ranking function as the first expression `x + y` decreases with each iteration until it becomes non-positive, at which point the second expression `y` begins to decrease, ensuring that the loop eventually terminates.",

Therefore, `x` could be a component of the ranking function.\n\n2. `y` is multiplied by `-2` in each iteration, so it changes its sign with every iteration and its absolute value is doubled. Hence, `y` is not definitely decreasing with every iteration of the loop, so it cannot be a component of the ranking function.\n\nFrom the analysis, it is evident that only `x` is definitely decreasing at every iteration of the loop. Therefore, the ranking function for the loop in the given program is `x`.\n\nThe ranking function is valid because `x` is definitely decreasing with every iteration and once it becomes non-positive, the loop terminates.\n\nSo, the ranking function in ACSL syntax is:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n*/\n```",

In this case, the variable `x` is being decremented by 1 in every iteration. Therefore, `x` can be chosen as the first expression in the ranking function.\n\nNext, we need to find an expression that decreases once `x` becomes zero or negative. In this case, the variable `y` is being multiplied by -2 in every iteration of the loop. This implies that `y` will start decreasing once `x` becomes zero or negative. Therefore, `y` can be chosen as the second expression in the ranking function.\n\nHowever, since `y` is being multiplied by -2 in every iteration, the absolute value of `y` is actually increasing. Therefore, we can use the ternary operator to express the absolute value of `y` as the second expression in the ranking function.\n\nHere is the multi-phase ranking function:\n\n```c\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n    loop variant y >= 0 ? y : -y;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because `x` decreases with every iteration of the loop and `y` starts decreasing once `x` becomes zero or negative.

Also, x + y > 0 holds true since it is the loop condition.\n\nAfter the loop termination, x + y <= 0 holds true, as it is the negation of the loop condition.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants are:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant \\at(x, LoopEntry) >= x;\n    loop invariant \\at(y, LoopEntry) <= y;\n    loop invariant x + y > 0;\n    loop invariant x + y <= 0;\n*/\n```\n\nThe first loop invariant implies that the value of x decreases in every iteration of the loop. The second loop invariant implies that the absolute value of y increases in every iteration of the loop. Therefore, these loop invariants support the ranking function and prove the termination of the loop.",
                    "First, note the variables that are live at the loop head. Here, they are x and y.\n\nThe loop condition is \"x + y > 0\".\n\nThe loop variant is a lexicographic ranking function (x, y >= 0 ? y : -y). \n\nWe have to output loop invariants that support the validity of the given ranking function.\n\nLet's first write loop invariants that hold before the loop starts and in every iteration of the loop:\n\n1. The value of x decreases with every iteration. This is because x is decremented by 1 in the loop body.\n2. The absolute value of y increases with every iteration. This is because y is multiplied by -2 in every iteration.\n\nTherefore, we can say that the loop variant decreases with every iteration.\n\nNow, let's write loop invariants that hold after the loop terminates:\n\n3. After the loop terminates, the value of x + y is no longer greater than 0. Therefore, x + y <= 0.\n\nWe can write the loop invariants as follows:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x <= \\at(x, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant \\abs(y) >= \\abs(\\at(y, LoopEntry));\n    loop invariant x + y > 0;\n    loop assigns x, y;\n    loop variant (x, y >= 0 ? y : -y);\n*/\n```\n\nThese loop invariants support the validity of the ranking function and prove the termination of the loop.",
                    "The loop condition is `x + y > 0`. The loop body contains the operations `x = x - 1;` and `y = -2*y;`. The ranking function is a lexicographic ranking function with the sequence `(x, y >= 0 ? y : -y)`. \n\nBefore the loop execution, there are no specific constraints on `x` and `y` other than the fact that they can be any integer. \n\nThe loop invariant that holds before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop is that `x + y > 0`. \n\nIn every iteration of the loop, `x` decreases by 1 and `y` is multiplied by -2. This means that `x` always decreases and `y` always changes in absolute value. \n\nAfter the loop termination, `x + y <= 0` holds.\n\nThe loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x + y > 0;\n    loop invariant x >= \\at(x, LoopEntry) - 1;\n    loop invariant y == -2*\\at(y, LoopEntry) || y == \\at(y, LoopEntry);\n    loop invariant x + y <= 0;\n*/\n```\nThese loop invariants support the ranking function `(x, y >= 0 ? y : -y)`. The first expression `x` always decreases, and if it remains the same, the second expression `y >= 0 ? y : -y` changes, ensuring the ranking function decreases lexicographically in every iteration of the loop."
