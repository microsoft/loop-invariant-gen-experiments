Once it becomes non-positive (i.e., `y` becomes even), we can move back to the first expression. This process continues until the loop terminates when `y <= 1`.\n\nHere is the multi-phase ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant y % 2 == 0 ? y : -1;\n    loop variant y % 2 == 1 ? y : -1;\n*/\n```",
            "First, let's make a note of the starting values or constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head:\n\n- y: an unknown integer, could be positive or negative.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body:\n\n- If y is even (y % 2 == 0), it is divided by 2 in the loop body.\n- If y is odd (y % 2 != 0), it is multiplied by 3 and incremented by 1 in the loop body.\n\nWe need to find a multi-phase ranking function such that:\n\n1. The first expression decreases with successive iterations of the loop and continues to decrease.\n2. The second expression decreases once the first expression becomes zero or negative, and so on, until the last expression decreases until the loop terminates.\n\nConsidering the loop behavior, we can use the following ranking functions:\n\n1. The first ranking function can be the absolute value of y, as it will always be non-negative and will decrease with every iteration of the loop.\n\n2. The second ranking function can be the value of y itself, as it will decrease once the first ranking function becomes zero or negative.\n\nIn ACSL syntax, the multi-phase ranking function would be:\n\n```c\n/*@\n    loop variant y >= 0 ? y : -y;\n    loop variant y;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because:\n\n- The first expression, the absolute value of y, is always non-negative and decreases with every loop iteration. When y is even, it is divided by 2, decreasing its absolute value. When y is odd, it is multiplied by 3 and incremented by 1, which also decreases its absolute value.\n- The second expression, y itself, decreases once the first expression becomes zero or negative, which indicates that the loop is getting closer to termination.\n\nThus, this multi-phase ranking function proves that the loop will eventually terminate."
