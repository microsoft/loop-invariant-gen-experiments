Therefore, the lexicographic ranking function (e1, e2) is a valid ranking function for the given loop.\n\nIn ACSL syntax, the ranking function is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant a - b;\n    loop variant -a;\n*/\n```",
            "First, let's analyze the initial values and constraints of the variables that are live at the loop head:\n\n- `a` is initialized to the negation of an unknown integer. Therefore, `a` can be any negative integer.\n- `b` is also initialized to the negation of an unknown integer. Therefore, `b` can also be any negative integer.\n\nNow let's analyze the loop body and find a ranking function:\n\n```\nwhile (a > b) {\n    b = b + a;\n    a = a + 1;\n}\n```\n\n- The loop condition is `a > b`, which means `a - b` is positive.\n- In the loop body, `b` is updated to `b + a`, and `a` is updated to `a + 1`.\n\nNow let's find a lexicographic ranking function:\n\n1. The first expression should be positive and decrease with each iteration. We can use `a - b` as the first expression since it is positive (due to the loop condition) and decreases with each iteration (since `b` increases by `a` and `a` only increases by 1).\n\n2. If the first expression remains constant, the second expression should be positive and decrease with each iteration. However, since `a - b` always decreases with each iteration, there is no need for a second expression in this case.\n\nSo the lexicographic ranking function for this loop is `(a - b)`.\n\nHere's the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant a - b;\n*/\n```",

The first expression in the ranking function should be positive and decrease with every iteration of the loop.\n   We can use `a - b` as the first expression. It is positive because of the loop condition `a > b`, and it decreases with every iteration since `b` increases by `a` in each iteration, and `a` increases by 1.\n\n2. If the first expression remains the same, the second expression should be positive and decrease with every iteration of the loop.\n   We can use `a` as the second expression. It is positive because `a > b` and it decreases with every iteration because `a` increases by 1.\n\nSo, the lexicographic ranking function is (a - b, a).
