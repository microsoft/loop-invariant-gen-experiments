The upper bound of `x` is `max`.\n\nSo, the ranking function in this case could be `max - x + 1`.\n\nThis ranking function is valid because:\n- It is always positive inside the loop. When `x = max`, the ranking function is `1`, and it is higher than `1` when `x < max`.\n- It decreases with each iteration of the loop. Because `x` increases by `1` in each iteration, the value of `max - x + 1` decreases by `1` in each iteration.\n\nSo, the ranking function in ACSL syntax is:\n\n```c\n/*@\n    loop variant max - x + 1;\n*/\n```",

This function decreases with every iteration of the loop (since x increases) and is positive while the loop is executing (since x is always less than or equal to max).\n\nLet's put the ranking function in ACSL syntax.\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant max - x + 1;\n*/\n```",

This expression is positive as long as the loop continues because `x` is always less than or equal to `max`.
