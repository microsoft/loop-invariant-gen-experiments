Since `a` and `b` are the same at the beginning of the loop (as per the if condition `if (a != b) { return 0; }`), `x` and `y` are being decremented by the same amount, which is `1 - 1 = 0`.\n\nTherefore, the loop will continue indefinitely unless either `x` or `y` is negative at the start.

It is worth noting that the program has a condition a != b, which means a and b are equal. Therefore, the decrease in each iteration for both x and y is -1.\n\nNow, let's find the lexicographic ranking function for this loop. For the first expression, we can use x + 1, which is positive and decreases with each loop iteration. For the second expression, we can use y + 1, which is positive and decreases with each loop iteration.\n\nHowever, we need to consider the loop condition.

We have `x = x + a - b - 1` and `y = y + b - a - 1`. However, we know from the program's preconditions that `a == b`. Therefore, these updates simplify to `x = x - 1` and `y = y - 1`.\n\nThus, both `x` and `y` decrease by 1 in each iteration of the loop.\n\nNow, to find a lexicographic ranking function, we need to find expressions that are positive while the loop is executing and decrease in each iteration.\n\nSince `x` and `y` both decrease in each iteration and are nonnegative during the loop execution, they can be used as the expressions in our lexicographic ranking function.\n\nTherefore, the lexicographic ranking function is `(x, y)`.

Before the loop starts, `a` is equal to `b` because of the condition check.\n2. `x` and `y` are always decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.\n3. `x` and `y` are always non-negative at the start of the loop.\n4.

After the loop termination, `x + 1` and `y + 1` are 0, which are non-negative, satisfying the properties of the ranking function. Hence, the loop terminates.",
                    "First, observe the initial conditions. The program assigns non-deterministic values to all variables. However, note that the program immediately returns if `a != b`, hence we know that at the loop head, `a == b`.\n\nNext, observe the loop condition. The loop continues as long as either `x >= 0` or `y >= 0`.\n\nFinally, observe the loop body. The loop updates `x` and `y` by subtracting `1` and adding `a - b` in each iteration. Since `a == b`, the effect is that `x` and `y` decrease by `1` in each iteration.\n\nNow, let's define the loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant a == b;\n    loop invariant x >= -1;\n    loop invariant y >= -1;\n    loop invariant x < \\at(x, LoopEntry) + 1;\n    loop invariant y < \\at(y, LoopEntry) + 1;\n*/\n```\n\nThese invariants satisfy the conditions:\n- They are true before the loop execution: `a == b` is true by the program logic, and `x >= -1`, `y >= -1` are true because `x` and `y` are initialized with non-deterministic values and can only decrease within the loop.\n- They hold in every iteration of the loop: `x` and `y` are always decreased, and `a == b` does not change.\n- They imply that the ranking function decreases with every iteration: This is directly given by `x < \\at(x, LoopEntry) + 1` and `y < \\at(y, LoopEntry) + 1`. Since `x` and `y` decrease by `1` in each iteration, the lexicographic ranking function `(x + 1, y + 1)` also decreases in each iteration. \n\nThese invariants thus support the validity of the ranking function and prove the termination of the loop."
