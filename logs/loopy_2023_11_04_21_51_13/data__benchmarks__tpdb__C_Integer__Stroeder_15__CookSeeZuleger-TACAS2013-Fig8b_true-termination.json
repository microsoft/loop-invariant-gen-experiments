            "- The loop in the code runs while `x` is not equal to `M`.\n- The loop modifies `x` in each iteration. If `x` is greater than `M`, `x` is set to 0. Otherwise, `x` is incremented by 1.\n- The initial values of `x` and `M` are unknown, but we know that `M` is positive.\n- Based on this, a possible ranking function could be `M - x`.\n\nNow, let's explain why `M - x` is a valid ranking function.\n\n- The value of `M - x` is positive as long as `x` is not equal to `M`, which is the loop condition.\n- If `x` is greater than `M`, `x` is set to 0, and `M - x` increases. If `x` is less than `M`, `x` is incremented by 1, and `M - x` decreases by 1.\n- Thus, `M - x` is decreasing with every iteration of the loop.\n\nWe can therefore conclude that `M - x` is a valid ranking function for this loop.\n\nThe ranking function in ACSL syntax is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant M - x;\n*/\n```",
            "- The loop starts with `x != M`. Therefore, `x` and `M` are the variables that are live at the loop head.\n- The loop condition is `x != M`, and the loop continues as long as this condition is true. Thus, the loop terminates when `x == M`.\n- In the loop body, `x` either gets reset to `0` when `x > M`, or gets incremented by 1 when `x <= M`. \n\nThe ranking function is `M - x` in this case. \n\n- It is valid because `M - x` is always positive as long as the loop continues (since `x != M`).\n- Also, `M - x` decreases with each iteration because `x` is getting closer to `M` in each iteration of the loop.\n\nThe ranking function in ACSL syntax would be:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant M - x;\n*/\n```",
            "The starting values for the variables that are live at the loop head are `x` and `M`, and both are set to `unknown_int()`. So, we don't know their starting values for sure, but we do know that `M > 0`.\n\nThe loop body increments `x` by 1 or sets it to 0, depending on whether `x` is less than or greater than `M`.\n\nThe loop continues as long as `x` is not equal to `M`.\n\nBased on this, we can see that the value of `M - x` can serve as a ranking function. This is because:\n\n- The value of `M - x` is positive when the loop continues (since `x` is not equal to `M` and `M > 0`).\n- The value of `M - x` decreases with every iteration of the loop. If `x > M`, `x` is set to 0, making `M - x` smaller on the next iteration. If `x < M`, `x` is incremented, again making `M - x` smaller on the next iteration.\n\nSo, the ranking function in ACSL syntax is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant M - x;\n*/\n```",
            "The variables that are live at the loop head are `x` and `M`. The value of `x` can either stay the same or increase by 1 in each iteration of the loop, while `M` stays the same.\n\nThe loop continues executing as long as `x` is not equal to `M`. Therefore, we can say that the difference `M - x` is always positive while the loop is executing.\n\nIn each iteration of the loop, `x` increases by 1 if it's less than `M`, otherwise it is reset to 0. Therefore, the difference `M - x` decreases in each iteration of the loop. \n\nThis leads us to the conclusion that `M - x` is a valid ranking function for the loop in the given program. The ACSL syntax for this ranking function is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant M - x;\n*/\n``` \n\nThis ranking function is valid because it decreases in each iteration of the loop and is positive while the loop is executing, which are the two necessary conditions for a valid ranking function.",

Therefore, the ranking function for this loop is M - x.\n\nIn ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant M - x;\n*/\n``` \n\nThis is a valid ranking function because it decreases with each loop iteration and is positive while the loop is executing, indicating that the loop will eventually terminate."

If `x <= M`, `x` is incremented by 1.\n3. We need to find a lexicographic ranking function (sequence of expressions) that decreases with every iteration of the loop and evaluates to positive values while the loop is executing.\n\nLet's analyze the two branches of the loop body:\n- In the first branch, if `x > M`, `x` is set to 0. Since `M > 0`, we know that `x` was positive before being set to 0. In this case, the value of `x` decreases.\n- In the second branch, if `x <= M`, `x` is incremented by 1. Since `x` is positive and less than or equal to `M`, the value of `x` increases, but it is still less than `M`.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can construct a lexicographic ranking function as follows:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant M - x;\n*/\n```\nThis ranking function is valid because:\n- The value of `M - x` is positive while the loop is executing, as `x` is never equal to `M`.\n- In the first branch, `x` is set to 0, which causes `M - x` to increase. However, since the loop condition requires `x != M`, this branch can only be executed a finite number of times. \n- In the second branch, `x` is incremented by 1, which causes `M - x` to decrease. Since `x` and `M` are integers, this branch can also only be executed a finite number of times.\n\nThus, the lexicographic ranking function `(M - x)` guarantees that the loop terminates.",
            "First, let's identify the loop head and the variables that are live at the loop head.\n\nIn this program, the loop head is the `while (x != M)` loop, and the live variables at the loop head are `x` and `M`.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body. The loop has two branches, one where `x > M` and one where `x <= M`.\n\n1. If `x > M`, the loop body sets `x` to 0. In this case, `x` decreases and `M` remains the same.\n2. If `x <= M`, the loop body increments `x`. In this case, `x` increases and `M` remains the same.\n\nSince `M` remains the same throughout the loop, we can use it as the first expression in our lexicographic ranking function. Note that `M` is positive due to the condition `if (M > 0)` before the loop.\n\nNext, we need to find a second expression that decreases when the first expression remains constant. In this case, when `x <= M`, we can use `M - x` as the second expression. `M - x` is positive when the loop is executing and decreases when `x` increases.\n\nSo, the lexicographic ranking function for this loop is `(M, M - x)`.\n\nIn ACSL syntax, the ranking function can be written as:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant M;\n    loop variant M - x;\n*/\n```"

So, x decreases in this case. \n- If x <= M, x is incremented by 1. So, in this case x tends to reach M. \n\nFrom this analysis, we can infer that the loop is trying to make x equal to M, and that this is the termination condition. \n\nTherefore, a good candidate for a ranking function would be the difference between M and x, which is (M - x). This difference decreases with every iteration of the loop and becomes 0 when the loop terminates. \n\nSo, the ranking function is (M - x). \n\nLet's present it in ACSL (Ansi/ISO C Specification Language) syntax: \n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant M - x;\n*/\n```\n\nThis is a valid ranking function because it always decreases with each iteration of the loop until it becomes 0, at which point the loop terminates.",

In each iteration of the loop, if `x` is greater than `M`, `x` is set to `0`. Otherwise, `x` is incremented by `1`.\n\nWe can have two ranking functions in this case. \n\nThe first ranking function is `M - x`, which is always positive at the start of the loop (as `x != M` is the loop condition). If `x > M`, `x` is set to `0`, which makes the value of `M - x` increase. If `x < M`, `x` is incremented, which decreases `M - x`. Therefore, the first ranking function is not always decreasing.\n\nHowever, we note that if `x > M`, `x` is set to `0`, which makes the value of `M - x` equal to `M`. Therefore, `M` can be our second ranking function. This is always decreasing in the second phase of the loop (when `x > M`), because in this case, `x` is set to `0` and `M` remains constant, ensuring that `M` decreases.\n\nTherefore, the multi-phase ranking function is `(M - x, M)`.\n\nHere is the multi-phase ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant M - x;\n    loop variant M;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because it satisfies the conditions of a multi-phase ranking function: `M - x` decreases in the first phase of the loop and `M` decreases in the second phase.

If `x` is not greater than `M`, `x` is incremented by 1.\n\nWhen `x` is equal to `M`, the loop terminates.\n\nLet's identify the variables that are live at the loop head:\n- `x`\n- `M`\n\nWe need to find a multi-phase ranking function for this loop. \n\nThe first expression in the ranking function should decrease with successive iterations of the loop. \n\nLooking at the loop, we see that if `x` is greater than `M`, `x` is set to 0, otherwise `x` is incremented.\n\nSo, we can consider `M - x` as the first expression in the ranking function. This expression decreases with each iteration as `x` is either set to 0 or incremented. When `x` is equal to or greater than `M`, this expression becomes non-positive.\n\nThe second expression in the ranking function should decrease once the first expression becomes zero or negative.\n\nIn this case, we can consider `x` as the second expression. When `M - x` is zero or negative, `x` is equal to or greater than `M` and so `x` is set to 0 in the next iteration, hence `x` decreases.\n\nSo, the multi-phase ranking function for this loop is `(M - x, x)`.\n\nThe ranking function is valid because:\n- The first expression `M - x` decreases with each iteration and becomes non-positive when `x` is equal to or greater than `M`.\n- The second expression `x` decreases when the first expression `M - x` becomes non-positive.\n- The loop terminates when both expressions are non-positive, i.e., when `x` is equal to `M`.\n\nHere is the ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant M - x;\n    loop variant x;\n*/\n```",

The loop continues as long as `x` is not equal to `M`. There are two branches inside the loop. If `x` is greater than `M`, `x` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `x` is incremented by 1.\n\nSo, a valid ranking function for this loop could be `(M - x, x)`. Let's explain why:\n\n- `M - x` is the first expression. It decreases with every iteration of the loop as `x` is either reset to 0 or incremented. It will become non-positive when `x` equals `M`.\n\n- `x` is the second expression. It starts decreasing once the first expression `M - x` becomes non-positive. It will become non-positive when `x` is reset to 0.\n\nThus, `(M - x, x)` is a valid multi-phase ranking function for the loop in the program. In ACSL syntax, the ranking function would be written as:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant M - x;\n    loop variant x;\n*/\n```",

If `x > M`, `x` is reset to 0, so `M - x` increases. But if `x <= M`, `x` is incremented, so `M - x` decreases. Therefore, `M - x` does not monotonically decrease with every loop iteration, and cannot be the first expression in our ranking function.\n\nHowever, if we consider the absolute value of `M - x`, we can see that it does decrease with every loop iteration. If `x > M`, `x` is reset to 0, so `|M - x|` decreases. If `x <= M`, `x` is incremented, so `|M - x|` decreases as well. Therefore, `|M - x|` is a suitable first expression in our ranking function.\n\nThe second expression in our ranking function should start decreasing once `|M - x|` becomes non-positive, i.e., once `x` equals `M`. However, once `x` equals `M`, the loop terminates, so we don't need a second expression in our ranking function.\n\nSo, the ranking function is:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant M - x >= 0 ? M - x : -(M - x);\n*/\n```\nThis is a valid ranking function because it decreases with every iteration of the loop, and becomes non-positive when the loop terminates."

The value of x is arbitrary but finite because it comes from an unknown function call.\n\n(ii) In every iteration of the loop:\n1. The value of x is always less than or equal to M. This is because whenever x exceeds M, it is reset to 0 in the next loop iteration.\n2. The value of x is always non-negative. This is because x is initialized to 0 when it exceeds M and is then only incremented.\n\n(iii) After the loop termination:\n1. The value of x is equal to M.

It is non-negative because x is always less than or equal to M. It decreases because x is incremented or reset to 0, which increases the difference M - x.\n- The second expression x increases in every loop iteration where x <= M and stays at 0 in every loop iteration where x > M. This supports the lexicographical decrease of the ranking function.\n\nTherefore, the loop terminates.",

The fourth and fifth loop invariants are derived from the loop condition and the ranking function. They ensure that the ranking function decreases with every iteration. The first part of the ranking function `M - x` decreases when `x` increases. The second part of the ranking function `x` increases when `x` does not decrease.

They are initialized with an unknown integer value, and there is a constraint that `M` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.\n\nThe loop continues to execute as long as `x` is not equal to `M`. In the loop body, if `x` is greater than `M`, `x` is set to 0, otherwise `x` is incremented by 1.\n\nThe ranking function given is a lexicographic ranking function `(M - x, x)`. The first part `M - x` decreases when `x` is less than `M` and `x` is incremented. The second part `x` decreases when `x` is greater than `M` and `x` is set to 0.\n\nNow let's find the loop invariants to support this ranking function:\n\n- Before the loop starts, `x` is less than or equal to `M` and `x` is greater than or equal to 0. This is because `x` can be any integer but the loop only executes if `M` is greater than 0 and `x` is either incremented or set to 0 inside the loop. So, `x` cannot be less than 0.\n\n- During the loop execution, `x` always remains less than or equal to `M` and greater than or equal to 0. This is because `x` is either incremented (if `x` is less than `M`) or set to 0 (if `x` is greater than `M`). So, `x` never becomes less than 0 or greater than `M`.\n\n- After the loop termination, `x` is equal to `M`. This is because the loop terminates only when `x` becomes equal to `M`.\n\n- Additionally, `M` always remains greater than 0.\n\nSo, the loop invariants are:\n\n```c\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= x <= M;\n    loop invariant M > 0;\n*/\n```\n\nThese loop invariants imply that the ranking function `(M - x, x)` decreases with every loop iteration, and thus, prove the termination of the loop."
