            "1. The variables live at the loop head are `x`, `y`, and `n`.\n2. The variable `x` is being updated in every iteration. Its value is being decreased by `5` and added by `-x + y`.\n3. The variable `y` is being multiplied by `2` in every iteration.\n4. The variable `n` is not being modified.\n\nSince the loop condition is `x > 0 && x < n`, we can create a ranking function based on `n - x`. This value will always be positive as long as the loop continues to execute. Also, since `x` is being increased with every iteration, `n - x` will decrease, satisfying the condition for a ranking function.\n\nSo, the ranking function for the loop is `n - x`.\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant n - x;\n*/\n``` \n\nThis ranking function is valid because it is positive during loop execution and decreases with every iteration, ensuring termination of the loop.",
            "The variables live at the loop head are `x`, `y`, and `n`.\n\nLooking at the loop body, we see that `x` is updated in every iteration by the expression `-x + y - 5` and `y` is doubled.\n\nA good candidate for the ranking function would be `n - x`. This is because `n` is a constant within the loop and `x` is strictly increasing in every iteration (since it is negated and then some positive quantity is subtracted from it).\n\nThis meets our requirements for a ranking function, as it is guaranteed to decrease with every iteration and is positive as long as the loop continues to execute. So, the ranking function for the loop in the program is `n - x`.\n\nIn ACSL syntax, it would be represented as:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant n - x;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because it decreases with each iteration of the loop (since `x` increases with each iteration) and is positive as long as the loop continues to execute (since `x < n` is a condition for the loop to continue executing).",
            "The loop in this program continues as long as `x` is positive and less than `n`. Therefore, `x` is the loop variable that our ranking function will depend on. However, the loop body does not increment or decrement `x` in a predictable way, as `x` becomes `-x + y - 5` in each iteration. This means we cannot simply use `x` or `n - x` as the ranking function.\n\nSince the loop condition requires `x` to be less than `n` and `x` is negated in each iteration, we can use the absolute value of `x` as the ranking function. This value is guaranteed to decrease in each iteration, as `x` is subtracted by `5` after being negated.\n\nSo, the ranking function for this loop is `n - |x|`, where `|x|` is the absolute value of `x`. In each iteration, `n - |x|` decreases (as `|x|` increases), and the loop terminates when `n - |x|` is no longer positive (i.e., when `x` is no longer less than `n`).\n\nIn ACSL syntax, the loop variant is:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant n - (x < 0 ? -x : x);\n*/\n```\nThis ranking function is valid as it decreases with each iteration and is positive as long as the loop continues to execute.",
            "- Make note of the starting values or constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head.\n\nThe variables live at the loop head are `x`, `y`, and `n`. The `x` variable is an integer that we are checking if it is greater than `0` and less than `n`. The `y` variable is an integer with an unknown initial value, and `n` is also an integer with an unknown initial value.\n\n- Analyze the loop body and find a ranking function involving the variables in the loop body\n\nIn each iteration of the loop, `x` is updated to `-x + y - 5` and `y` is updated to `2*y`.\n\nWe can see that `x` is changed in a way that could make it decrease, as it is negated and 5 is subtracted from it. However, `y` is also added to it, and since `y` is doubled in each iteration, the value of `y` might influence the value of `x` in a way that could make `x` increase in the next iteration. \n\nDespite this, since `x` is negated in each iteration, if it was positive, it becomes negative, and vice versa. Hence, if `x` was greater than zero (as required by the loop condition), it becomes less than zero in the next iteration. Therefore, the loop cannot execute more than twice.\n\nThis suggests that the loop has at most two iterations, one when `x` is positive and the next one when `x` is negative. Therefore, the ranking function for this loop can be `2 - (x <= 0)`, which is `2` in the first iteration and `1` in the second iteration, and it decreases with each iteration.\n\n- Output the ranking function in one code block, in ACSL syntax.\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant 2 - (x <= 0);\n*/\n```\n\nThis is a valid ranking function because it decreases with each iteration of the loop, and it is positive while the loop is executing.",

This is a valid ranking function because:\n- It is positive as long as the loop continues to execute (`x` is always less than `n` while the loop is running).\n- It decreases with each iteration of the loop since `x` is increased in every iteration.\n\nThe ranking function in ACSL syntax is:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant n - x;\n*/\n```"

After the loop termination, it is true because x must be non-positive for the loop to exit, and the loop condition ensures that x cannot be negative.\n2. `x <= n`: This is true before the loop execution because the loop condition `x < n` ensures that x is less than n.

Once e2 becomes non-positive, we move on to e3 which decreases till it becomes non-positive and the loop terminates.\nFind the multi-phase ranking function for the loop in the following program and explain why it is a valid ranking function.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make note of the starting values or constraints for the variables that are live at the loop head.\n- Analyze the loop body and find a ranking function such that:\n    - The first expression decreases in the first iteration of the loop and continues to decrease\n    - The second expression decreases once the first expression becomes zero or negative\n    - so on... till the last expression decreases till the loop terminates.\n- Output the ranking function in one code block, in ACSL syntax, in the order they decrease, in different lines. For example,\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant v1;\n    loop variant v2;\n*/\n```\n\nRules:\n- **Do not use constants or functions not defined in the program. Use the ternary operator to describe the absolute value of an expression.**"

            "From the loop condition, we know that `x` is always positive and less than `n` at the loop head. Also, `x` is updated in each iteration of the loop to `-x + y - 5` and `y` is updated to `2*y`. \n\nThe first ranking function can be `n - x` because it is positive at the loop head and decreases with every iteration as `x` increases. \n\nHowever, `x` will eventually become non-positive as it is updated to `-x + y - 5` in each iteration. When `x` becomes non-positive, `n - x` will not decrease anymore. We need to find a second ranking function that will decrease once `x` becomes non-positive. \n\nNotice that `y` is always increasing as it is updated to `2*y` in each iteration. Thus, the second ranking function can be `-y`.\n\nHence, the multi-phase ranking function is `(n - x, -y)`. \n\nThe ranking function `(n - x, -y)` is valid because:\n- `n - x` is positive at the loop head and decreases with every iteration until `x` becomes non-positive.\n- Once `x` is non-positive, `n - x` does not decrease anymore. However, `-y` starts to decrease as `y` increases with every iteration. \n- The loop terminates when both `n - x` and `-y` become non-positive.\n\nTherefore, `(n - x, -y)` is a valid multi-phase ranking function for the loop in the given program.\n\nWe can write the ranking function in ACSL syntax as follows:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant n - x;\n    loop variant -y;\n*/\n```\n\nThis tells the verifier that `n - x` and `-y` are ranking functions for the loop, which decrease with every iteration and eventually become non-positive. When both expressions are non-positive, the loop terminates.",
            "The first expression of our multi-phase ranking function should be a variable or expression that decreases with every iteration of the loop. Here, `x` is decreasing with every iteration as it is updated to `-x + y - 5`. Hence, `x` can be our first expression.\n\nThe second expression should start decreasing once the first expression becomes non-positive. Here, `y` is doubling with every iteration of the loop. But, if `x` is non-positive, it means `y` would be negative (since `x` is updated to `-x + y - 5`) and hence, `y` would be decreasing. So, `y` can be our second expression.\n\nThus, the multi-phase ranking function for the given loop is `(x, y)`.\n\nThe ACSL syntax for the ranking function is:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n    loop variant y;\n*/\n```",
            "Let's take a look at the loop conditions and the operations within the loop.\n\nThe loop continues while `x > 0 && x < n`. Inside the loop, `x` and `y` are updated with each iteration. `x` is replaced by `-x + y - 5` and `y` is replaced by `2*y`.\n\nWe can reason that `x` decreases in each iteration until it becomes non-positive, as it is updated by the expression `-x + y - 5` and `x > 0` initially. This makes `-x + y - 5` a valid first expression for our ranking function.\n\nOnce `x` becomes non-positive, we can see that `y` continues to increase as it's updated by `2*y`. \n\nBut we also need to ensure that the loop terminates. Since `x` is non-positive and `y` is increasing, the loop will terminate when `x >= n` is no longer true. This means `-n + x` is a valid second expression for our ranking function.\n\nSo, our multi-phase ranking function is `(-x + y - 5, -n + x)`. \n\nLet's write it out in ACSL syntax:\n\n```c\n/*@\n    loop variant -x + y - 5;\n    loop variant -n + x;\n*/\n```\n\nThis ranking function is valid because `-x + y - 5` decreases with each iteration until `x` becomes non-positive, at which point `-n + x` starts decreasing until the loop terminates.",
            "First, let's note the variables that are live at the loop head. The live variables are `x`, `y`, and `n`. \n\nNext, let's analyze the loop body to find the expressions that decrease with each loop iteration. The loop condition is `x > 0 && x < n`, which means the loop will continue as long as `x` is greater than 0 and less than `n`.\n\nIn the loop body, `x` is updated as `x = -x + y - 5` and `y` is updated as `y = 2*y`. \n\nNote that `x` will decrease in each iteration as long as `x` is positive and `y` is non-negative (which is the case as `y` is doubled in each iteration). Hence, `x` can be the first expression in the ranking function. \n\nOnce `x` becomes non-positive, `y` will start to decrease as it is being doubled in each iteration. Hence, `y` can be the second expression in the ranking function. \n\nThe multi-phase ranking function is therefore `(x, y)`. Let's express this in ACSL syntax:\n\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n    loop variant y;\n*/\n```\n\nThis is a valid ranking function because:\n- `x` is positive at the beginning and decreases with each loop iteration until it becomes non-positive.\n- Once `x` becomes non-positive, `y` starts to decrease with each loop iteration until the loop terminates.",

The variable `x` is a good candidate since it is negated in every iteration, meaning that it will decrease if it was positive. \n\nOnce `x` becomes non-positive, we need to find another expression that decreases. The variable `y` is multiplied by 2 in every iteration, so `n - y` could be a good candidate because it will decrease as `y` increases.\n\nThe multi-phase ranking function is thus `(x, n - y)`. \n\nThis is a valid ranking function because `x` decreases in each iteration until it becomes non-positive, at which point `n - y` begins to decrease with each iteration until the loop terminates. \n\nHere is the multi-phase ranking function in ACSL syntax:\n```\n/*@\n    loop variant x;\n    loop variant n - y;\n*/\n```"

Since x is always less than n, we can have n > x as an invariant.\n2.
