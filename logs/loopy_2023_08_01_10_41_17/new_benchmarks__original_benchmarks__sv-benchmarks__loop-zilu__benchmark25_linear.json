Since the loop only executes when `x < 0`, we can use an implication to make the loop invariant trivially true when `x >= 0`.\n\n2. We can add conjunctions to bound the maximum and minimum values that `x` can take. Since `x` starts with a value less than 0 and increases by 1 in each iteration, it is always true that `x >= -1`. Also, `x` can never be greater than 10, as the loop condition is `x < 10`. \n\n3. In this case, we don't have any other variables to compare `x` with.\n\n4. Since the assertion is not guarded by a condition, we don't need to use the guard condition in an implication.\n\n5. The variable `x` is non-deterministic at the beginning of the loop. We can use an implication to make the invariant trivially true at that location.\n\nWith these updates, our loop invariants for Frama-C would now look like this:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x < 0 ==> x >= -1;\n    loop invariant x < 10;\n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n*/\n```"
