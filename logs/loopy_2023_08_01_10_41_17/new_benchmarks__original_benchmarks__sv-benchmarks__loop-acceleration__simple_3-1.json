For the given program, we can add the bounds for `x` and `N`, and their relationship, as well as an implication for the post-condition:\n\nLoop invariants:\n1. `x` is always even\n2. `x` is less than or equal to `N`\n3. `N` is always non-negative\n4. If `x == N`, then `x % 2 == 0`\n\nThe updated loop invariants for the loop in the program are:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x % 2 == 0;\n    loop invariant x <= N;\n    loop invariant N >= 0;\n    loop invariant x == N ==> x % 2 == 0;\n*/\n```"

When x reaches N, the value of x is even, as it starts at 0 and increments by 2 in each iteration. This invariant helps with the assertion that x % 2 is true after the loop termination."
