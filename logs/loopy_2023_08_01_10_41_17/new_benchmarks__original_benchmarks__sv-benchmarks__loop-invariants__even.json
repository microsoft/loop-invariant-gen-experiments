The first invariant alone is sufficient to verify the post-condition.\n\nIn this specific program, there are no variables that have explicit upper or lower bounds, nor are there any variables that are always smaller or larger than another variable. The loop invariant `x % 2 == 0` already captures the information needed for the verification."
