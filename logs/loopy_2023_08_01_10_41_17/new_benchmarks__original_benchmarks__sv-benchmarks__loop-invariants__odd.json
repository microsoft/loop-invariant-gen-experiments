It is true before the loop execution since `x` is initialized to 1. In every iteration of the loop, `x` is incremented by 2, ensuring that it remains greater than or equal to 1.\n\n2. `x % 2 == 1`: This loop invariant states that the variable `x` is always odd. It is true before the loop execution since `x` is initialized to 1. In every iteration of the loop, `x` is incremented by 2, which maintains its oddness. After the loop termination, it ensures that the post-condition `__VERIFIER_assert(x % 2);` holds.\n\n3. `__VERIFIER_nondet_int() ==> (x + 2) % 2 == 1`: This loop invariant uses the implication operator to express the conditional nature of the loop. It states that if `__VERIFIER_nondet_int()` returns a non-zero value, the next value of `x` (`x + 2`) will also be odd. This invariant is trivially true when `__VERIFIER_nondet_int()` returns zero, as the loop will not execute in that case."

This ensures that `x` will not overflow when incremented by 2 in the loop body.\n\nThese loop invariants hold true (i) before the loop execution, (ii) in every iteration of the loop, and (iii) after the loop termination, ensuring that the post-condition `x % 2` is satisfied."
