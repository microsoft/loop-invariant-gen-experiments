However, it may not hold for all iterations of the loop since the values of `x` and `y` change inside the loop.\n\n2. `loop invariant 2 * x >= y * (y + 1);`: This invariant is more complex, and it is unclear whether it holds true for all iterations of the loop. We need to investigate if it can be improved or replaced with a more appropriate invariant.\n\n3. `loop invariant 0 <= y <= 1000;`: This invariant is partially proven, which means it's likely correct and just needs additional support from other invariants.\n\nLet's try to fix the invariants. We can improve the first invariant by combining it with the third invariant, ensuring that it holds after loop entry:\n\n```\nloop invariant y <= x && 0 <= y <= 1000;\n```\n\nNow, let's re-examine the second invariant.

If the invariant cannot be proved on loop entry, could you alter the invariant to conditionally hold only after loop entry by adding an implies clause? Or, could you alter the invariant to hold on loop entry as well?\n2. If the invariant could not be proven to be maintained, could you make the invariant stronger or fix it in another way?\n3. If the assertion i.e. the post-condition could not be proved fully, could you add more loop invariants or make the existing invariants stronger?\n4. Would rewriting the invariant expressions help? Eg. converting division to multiplication\n5. Do the invariant expressions have the correct types? Eg. are they integer expressions when they should be boolean expressions?\n\nIf it is a syntax error:\n- To refer to a variable's value in the beginning of the loop, you cannot use keywords like 'old', 'initial', etc. \nInstead, make the expression conditional on loop entry using an implies clause. \nEg. 'loop invariant i == 0 ==> i == x'  instead of 'loop invariant i_initial == x', for a loop that starts with i = 0.\n- To refer to a variable's value in the end of the loop, you cannot use keywords like 'new', 'final', etc.\nInstead, make the expression conditional on loop exit using an implies clause.\nEg. 'loop invariant i == 100 ==> i == y'  instead of 'loop invariant i_final == y', for a loop that ends with i = 100.\n- Do not use '\\at(x, Pre)' or '\\at(x, Here)' in the loop invariant.
