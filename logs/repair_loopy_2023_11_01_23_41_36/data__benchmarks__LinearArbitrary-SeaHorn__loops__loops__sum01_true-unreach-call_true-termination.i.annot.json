                    "- The pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program are: `i`, `n` and `sn` are integer variables. The value of `n` is assigned by a function call to `unknown_int()`, and `sn` is initialized to `0`. The function `unknown_int()` is non-deterministic and can return any integer value. However, it is assumed that `-1000 <= n < 1000`.\n\n- The loop condition is `i <= n` and the loop body increments `i` by `1` and `sn` by `2` in each iteration.\n\n- Looking at the Frama-C output, all of the invariants are either `Unknown` or `Partially proven`. There are no syntax errors or unbound logic variable errors.\n\n- Now let's try to fix the invariants:\n\n  - `i1` and `i4` are identical. One of them can be removed.\n  \n  - `i3`, `i7` and `i11` are identical. Two of them can be removed. This invariant `n >= -1000 && n < 1000` is already stated in the precondition and it doesn't change in the loop. So, it should be valid.\n\n  - `i5` says `i == 1` which is only true in the first iteration of the loop. It's not a valid loop invariant because it doesn't hold for all iterations. This invariant should be removed.\n\n  - `i6` and `i8` are derived from the code. `sn` is initially `0` and it is incremented by `2` in each iteration, so it should always be `>= 0`. `sn` should also be `<= 2*n` because it's incremented by `2` in each iteration and `i` is incremented by `1`. These invariants should be valid.\n\n  - `i9` and `i10` are not directly derived from the code. `sn == 2*(i-1)` does not imply `i <= n` and `sn == 2*n` does not imply `i > n`. These invariants are not correct and should be removed.\n\n  - `i12` is not directly derived from the code. If `n >= 1`, `sn` is not necessarily `2 * (i-1)` and if `n < 1`, `sn` is not necessarily `0`. This invariant is not correct and should be removed.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the corrected loop invariants for the program are as follows:\n\n```\n/*@\n  loop invariant 1 <= i && i <= n+1;\n  loop invariant sn == 2*(i-1);\n  loop invariant n >= -1000 && n < 1000;\n  loop invariant sn >= 0;\n  loop invariant 0 <= sn <= 2*n;\n*/\n```"

Given a program, find loop invariants or fix incorrect invariants, which can then be used to verify the assertion(s) in the program. \nFrama-C is a software verification tool for C programs. The input to Frama-C is a C program file with ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations.\nFor the given program with loop invariants and the output from Frama-C, fix the invariants that are not inductive or have syntax errors, so that the program can be verified.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. \n- For each invariant that has syntax errors, fix the syntax errors and ensure that ACSL syntax is followed.\n- For each invariant that is not inductive, there are two possibilities:\n    - The invariant is Unknown: In this case, the invariant was not established or preserved yb the loop. So add a clause to the invariant such that the new invariant is holds before the loop execution and also after every loop iteration, if it holds before the loop iteration.\n    - The invariant is Partially Proven: In this case, the invariant was proven to be inductive under the assumption of some other invariants which could not be proven to be inductive.\n    So try to fix the invariants that this invariant depends on, so that the invariant is established and preserved.\n- Finally output loop invariants that are true \n(i) before the loop execution, \n(ii) in every iteration of the loop and \n(iii) after the loop termination, \nsuch that the loop invariants can be used to prove the assertion(s) that are labeled as \"Unproven\" by Frama-C.\n- If a loop invariant is a conjunction, split it into its parts.\n- Output all the loop invariants in one code block. For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values. Do not use variables that have garbage values.**\n- **Do not make assumptions about the values returned by non-deterministic function calls.**\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **Do not use keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops.**\n- **Use \\at(x, LoopEntry), instead of \\at(x, Pre) to refer to the value of a variable x just before the beginning of loop execution.**\n- **Variables that are not explicitly initialized, could have garbage values. Do not make any assumptions about such values.**"
