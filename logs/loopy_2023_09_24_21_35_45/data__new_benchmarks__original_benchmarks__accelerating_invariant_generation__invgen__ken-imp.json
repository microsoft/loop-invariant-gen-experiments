Since `x` is initialized with the value of `i` and `y` is initialized with the value of `j`, we can use the bounds of `i` and `j` as the bounds for `x` and `y` respectively. Therefore, we have:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i <= x <= i && j <= y <= j;\n*/\n```\n- In every iteration of the loop, we need an invariant that relates the values of `x` and `y`. Since both `x` and `y` are decremented by 1 in each iteration, we can use the relation `y == j - x`. Therefore, we have:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i <= x <= i && j <= y <= j;\n    loop invariant y == j - x;\n*/\n```\n- After the loop termination, we need an invariant that implies the post-condition. Since the assertion is guarded by the condition `i == j`, we need to use this condition in the invariant. Also, since `x` is decremented by 1 in each iteration and the loop terminates when `x == 0`, we know that the value of `x` at the end of the loop is `-1`. Therefore, we can use the relation `y == j - i - 1` in the invariant. Combining these, we have:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i <= x <= i && j <= y <= j;\n    loop invariant y == j - x;\n    loop invariant (i == j) ==> (y == j - i - 1);\n*/\n```\n\nNote that we do not need to add any implications for non-deterministic variables, since all variables in this program have deterministic values."

Since `x` is decremented in every iteration, `y - x` is also decremented in every iteration. Hence, if `y = \\old(j) - \\old(i) + x` at the beginning of the iteration, then `y - x = \\old(j) - \\old(i)` at the end of the iteration.\n    - Using the implication `y = \\old(j) - \\old(i) + x ==> y - x = \\old(j) - \\old(i)`, we can conclude that if the loop invariant holds at the beginning of the iteration, then the loop invariant also holds at the end of the iteration.\n    - Using the implication `y - x = \\old(j) - \\old(i) ==> y != 0`, we can conclude that if `y - x = \\old(j) - \\old(i)` (which is true at the end of the iteration), then `y != 0` (which is the post-condition guarded by `i==j`).\n    - Hence, the loop invariant `y = \\old(j) - \\old(i) + x ==> y != 0` is true in every iteration."
