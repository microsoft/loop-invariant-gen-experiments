It bounds the maximum and minimum values that `i` can take.\n- `9 <= j <= 10` is true before the loop, in every iteration and after the loop termination. It bounds the maximum and minimum values that `j` can take.\n- `0 <= sn <= 2*n` is true before the loop, in every iteration and after the loop termination. It bounds the maximum and minimum values that `sn` can take.\n- `(i<j) ==> (sn >= (i-1)*2)` is true before the loop and in every iteration. It states that if `i<j`, then `sn` is at least `2*(i-1)`. This is because if `i<j`, then the statement `sn = sn +(2)` is executed and it adds `2` to `sn` each time `i<j`.\n- `(i>=j) ==> (sn >= (j-1)*2)` is true before the loop and in every iteration. It states that if `i>=j`, then `sn` is at least `2*(j-1)`. This is because if `i>=j`, then the statement `sn = sn +(2)` is not executed and the value of `sn` remains the same as the previous iteration. Since `j` is decremented by `1` in each iteration, the maximum value of `j` in any iteration is `10-(i-1)` which is equal to `11-i`. Therefore, the maximum value of `j-1` is `10-i`. So, `sn` is at least `2*(10-i)` when `i>=j`.\n- `(i>=j) ==> (sn <= (n-j+1)*2)` is true before the loop and in every iteration. It states that if `i>=j`, then `sn` is at most `(n-j+1)*2`. This is because `j` is decremented by `1` in each iteration and the maximum value that `j` can take is `10-(i-1)` which is equal to `11-i`. Therefore, the maximum value that `n-j+1` can take is `n-(11-i)+1` which is equal to `i-10+n`. So, `sn` is at most `2*(i-10+n)` when `i>=j`.\n- The assertion is true after the loop termination if either `sn` is equal to `n*2` or `sn` is equal to `0`. Therefore, we don't need to add any additional invariant for the assertion."

It states that the sum of the first `i-1` even numbers is equal to `sn`. This is true because in each iteration, we add 2 to `sn` as long as `i` is less than `j`. Therefore, the sum of the first `i-1` even numbers is equal to `sn` at the end of each iteration.\n- The fifth invariant is true in every iteration of the loop as long as `i` is greater than `j`. It states that the sum of the even numbers from `j+1` to `i-1` is equal to `sn`. This is true because in each iteration, we add 2 to `sn` as long as `i` is greater than `j`. Therefore, the sum of the even numbers from `j+1` to `i-1` is equal to `sn` at the end of each iteration.\n- Finally, the assertion holds true at the end of the loop as it states that `sn` is equal to `n*2` or `0`. This is true because the loop computes the sum of the first `n` even numbers if `n` is less than or equal to `10`, otherwise it computes the sum of even numbers from `11` to `n`.",

Therefore, `1 <= i <= n+1`.\n  - `j` starts from `10` and decrements by `1` in every iteration until it becomes `n-1`. Therefore, `9 >= j >= n-1`.\n  - `sn` is updated with the value `(i-1)*2` if `i<j`, and remains `0` otherwise. Since `i` starts from `1` and `j` starts from `10`, `i-1` can take values from `0` to `n-1`. Therefore, `sn` can take values from `0` to `2*(n-1)`, which is equivalent to `(n-1)*2`. Hence, `sn == (i-1)*2 || sn == 0`.\n- After the loop termination:\n  - If `i` is equal to `n+1`, it means that the loop has iterated `n` times. Therefore, `sn` can take values from `0` to `n*2`, which satisfies the assertion `sn == n*(2) || sn == 0`. Hence, `(i == n+1) ==> (sn == n*2 || sn == 0)`.",
