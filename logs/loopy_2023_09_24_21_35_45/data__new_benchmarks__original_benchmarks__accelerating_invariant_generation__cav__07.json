Therefore, `j == i`. Also, since `j` increases by 1 in each iteration of the loop, it can never be greater than `n`, so `j <= n`.\n- The condition `j >= n+1` can only be true if the loop executed `n+1` times, which is not possible since the loop condition is `i<n`. Therefore, if `j >= n+1`, the program asserts false.

Therefore, i must also be greater than or equal to j, because j is always less than or equal to i. Hence, i is greater than or equal to n+1. This contradicts the loop invariant that i is less than or equal to n. Therefore, the post-condition is always true.",
            "ERROR: Output does not contain at least 1 code block\nOutput:\nPre-conditions:\n- The function `unknown1()` returns an integer value `n`.\n- The variable `i` is initialized to `0`.\n- The variable `j` is initialized to `0`.\n- The variable `n` is non-negative.\n\nLoop condition:\n- The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.\n\nPost-condition:\n- If `j` is greater than or equal to `n+1`, the assertion `\\false` is triggered.\n\nLoop invariants:\n1. `0 <= i <= n`: `i` is always between 0 and `n`, inclusive.\n2. `0 <= j <= i`: `j` is always between 0 and `i`, inclusive.\n3. `i <= n`: `i` is always less than or equal to `n`.\n4. `j <= n`: `j` is always less than or equal to `n`.\n5. `j <= i+1`: `j` is always less than or equal to `i+1`.\n6. `j < n+1 ==> i < n`: If `j` is less than `n+1`, then `i` is less than `n`. This implies that the loop will continue since `i` is less than `n`, which means that `i` is not equal to `n`. Therefore, `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration of the loop. This implies that `j` will also be incremented by 1, since `j` is equal to `i` in the previous iteration of the loop. Therefore, `j` will be less than `n+1` in the next iteration of the loop.\n\nAll the loop invariants are true:\n- Before the loop execution: All the loop invariants hold true because `i` is initialized to `0` and `j` is initialized to `0`.\n- In every iteration of the loop: \n    - Invariant 1 holds true because `i` is incremented by 1 in every iteration of the loop, and `n` does not change.\n    - Invariant 2 holds true because `j` is incremented by 1 in every iteration of the loop, and `i` is incremented by 1 in the same iteration.\n    - Invariants 3, 4, and 5 hold true because `i` and `j` are incremented by 1 in every iteration of the loop, and `n` does not change.\n    - Invariant 6 holds true because if `j` is less than `n+1` in the current iteration of the loop, then `i` is less than `n` in the same iteration. Therefore, `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration of the loop, and `j` will also be incremented by 1. This implies that `j` will be less than `n+1` in the next iteration of the loop.\n- After the loop termination: \n    - Invariants 1, 3, and 4 hold true because `i` is equal to `n` and `j` is less than or equal to `n` at the end of the loop.\n    - Invariant 2 holds true because `j` is equal to `i` at the end of the loop.\n    - Invariant 5 holds true because `j` is less than or equal to `n` at the end of the loop.\n    - Invariant 6 holds true because if `j` is less than `n+1` at the end of the loop, then `i` must also be less than `n` at the end of the loop. This is because `i` is incremented by 1 in every iteration of the loop, and `j` is incremented by 1 in the same iteration. Therefore, if `j` is less than `n+1` at the end of the loop, then `i` must have been less than `n` in the last iteration of the loop.",
