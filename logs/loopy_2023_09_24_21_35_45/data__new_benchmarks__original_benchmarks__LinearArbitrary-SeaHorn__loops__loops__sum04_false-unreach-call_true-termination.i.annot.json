This is because the loop iterates over the values of `i` from 1 to 8 (inclusive), so the minimum value of `i` is 1 and the maximum value of `i` is 9.\n- The second loop invariant `sn == 2*(i-1)/3` holds before the loop execution, during every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. This is because `sn` is only modified inside the loop by adding 2 to its value if `i` is less than 4. Therefore, the value of `sn` after the loop termination is equal to `2*(3-1) + 2*(6-3) + 2*(9-6) = 8*(2)`. Alternatively, if the condition inside the loop is never true, then `sn` will remain equal to its initial value of 0. Thus, the second loop invariant can be written as `sn==8*(2) || sn==0`. \n\nNote that we do not need to add any additional constraints on the values of `i` or `sn` because they are already bounded by the loop condition and the loop body."
