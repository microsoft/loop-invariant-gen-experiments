Therefore, `sn` is equal to `(i-1)*a` at the beginning of each iteration. The loop index `i` starts at 1 and ends at `n+1`, since the loop condition is `i<=n`. Therefore, at the end of the loop, `sn` is equal to `n*a`.\n- The loop invariants imply the post-condition, which states that `sn` is either equal to `n*a` or equal to 0. This is because `sn` is always a multiple of `a`, and if `n` is 0, then `sn` is also 0. If `n` is positive, then `sn` is positive and a multiple of `a`, and if `n` is negative, then `sn` is negative and a multiple of `a`. Therefore, `sn` is always either equal to `n*a` or equal to 0."

                    "content": "The pre-conditions and variable assignments in the program are:\n- The macro `assume` checks if its argument is true, otherwise the program returns 0.\n- There are two external functions, `unknown` and `unknown_int`, which we know nothing about.\n- The `abort` function is also an external function that terminates the program.\n- The program defines the macro `a` to be 2.\n- The `main` function declares three variables, `i`, `n`, and `sn`. It initializes `n` to the return value of `unknown_int()` which we know nothing about. It also initializes `sn` to 0.\n- The program checks if `n` is less than 1000 and greater than or equal to -1000 using an `if` statement. If the condition is false, the program returns 0.\n- The program then enters a `for` loop that iterates from 1 to `n` inclusive. In each iteration, it adds `a` to `sn`. \n- The program then has an assertion that checks if `sn` is equal to either `n*a` or 0.\n\nThe loop condition is `i<=n`. \n\nWe need to find loop invariants that are true:\n- Before the loop execution\n- In every iteration of the loop\n- After the loop termination\n\nWe can start by looking at the pre-conditions of the program and the loop condition. Since `n` is initialized to the return value of `unknown_int()`, we do not know anything about its value, except that it satisfies `n < 1000 && n >= -1000`. The loop condition is `i<=n`, so we know that `i` is also less than or equal to 1000. Therefore, we can add the following loop invariant before the loop execution:\n\n```\n/*@ loop invariant 1 <= i <= 1000;\n    loop invariant -1000 <= n < 1000;\n*/\n```\n\nWe know that `sn` is initialized to 0, and in each iteration of the loop, we add `a` to `sn`. Therefore, we can add the following loop invariant in every iteration of the loop:\n\n```\n/*@ loop invariant sn == (i-1)*a;\n*/\n```\n\nTo ensure that the loop invariant we added above holds true for the first iteration of the loop, we can use an implication with the loop invariant added before the loop execution. Therefore, we can add the following loop invariant before the loop execution:\n\n```\n/*@ loop invariant 1 <= i <= 1000;\n    loop invariant -1000 <= n < 1000;\n    loop invariant sn == 0 ==> i == 1;\n    loop invariant sn == (i-1)*a;\n*/\n```\n\nFinally, we need to ensure that the loop invariant implies the post-condition. The assertion checks if `sn` is equal to either `n*a` or 0. We can use an implication to ensure that the loop invariant implies the assertion. Therefore, we can add the following loop invariant after the loop termination:\n\n```\n/*@ loop invariant 1 <= i <= 1000;\n    loop invariant -1000 <= n < 1000;\n    loop invariant sn == 0 ==> i == 1;\n    loop invariant sn == (i-1)*a;\n    loop invariant sn == n*a || sn == 0;\n*/\n```\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n\n```\n/*@ loop invariant 1 <= i <= 1000;\n    loop invariant -1000 <= n < 1000;\n    loop invariant sn == 0 ==> i == 1;\n    loop invariant sn == (i-1)*a;\n    loop invariant sn == n*a || sn == 0;\n*/\nfor(i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n    sn = sn + a;\n}\n```"
