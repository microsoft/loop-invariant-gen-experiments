Therefore, we can only specify that `x` can take any value between 0 and 100, inclusive.\n- `y` is assigned the value of `x` before the loop, and is incremented along with `x` in each iteration. Therefore, `y` is always equal to `x` plus the number of loop iterations. This can be expressed as `y == x + (number of iterations of the loop)`.\n- Since there are no function calls or non-deterministic behavior in the loop, we do not need to add any additional invariants to handle such cases.\n- Finally, the assertion `x == y` holds if and only if the loop terminates, which is guaranteed by the loop condition. Therefore, we do not need to add any additional invariants to handle the assertion. \n\nPutting it all together, the loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= x <= 100;\n    loop invariant y == x + (\\at(x, LoopEntry) <= 100 ? \\at(x, LoopCurrent) - \\at(x, LoopEntry) : 100 - \\at(x, LoopEntry));\n*/\n``` \nNote that we used the `\\at` notation to refer to the value of `x` at different points in the loop.
