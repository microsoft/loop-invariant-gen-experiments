It holds in every iteration of the loop because `x` is either less than `N` or greater than `N`. If `x` is less than `N`, then the implication is trivially true as the right-hand side of the implication is `true`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `N`, then the left-hand side of the implication is false and the implication is true regardless of the value of the right-hand side. The loop invariant also holds after the loop termination because the loop terminates when `x` is greater than or equal to `N` and at that point `x % 2 == 0` by the second loop invariant. \n\nFinally, we can use the guard condition in an implication to modify the assertion:\n```\n#define assume(e) if(!(e)) return 0;\n\nint main(void) {\n  unsigned int x = 0;\n  unsigned short N;\n\n  while (x < N) {\n    x += 2;\n  }\n\n  assume(x >= N);\n  //@ assert x >= N ==> !(x % 2);\n}\n```\nExplanation:\n- We use the `assume` macro to add the guard condition `x >= N` before the assertion. This is because the assertion only needs to hold if the guard condition is true.\n- We use implication `x >= N ==> !(x % 2)` in the assertion to take care of the conditional nature of the code. This implies that if the guard condition is true, then `!(x % 2)` must also be true."

This is true before the loop execution (since `x` is initialized to `0` which is even) and in every iteration of the loop (since we are incrementing `x` by `2`).\n- The second invariant states that `x` is always less than or equal to `N`. This is true before the loop execution (since `x` is initially `0`) and in every iteration of the loop (since we are incrementing `x` by `2` and `N` is not changing within the loop).\n\nNow let's verify that these invariants imply the post-condition:\n- The post-condition states that `x` is even. This is directly implied by the first invariant.\n- Since `x` is always less than or equal to `N` according to the second invariant, we know that `x` cannot be greater than `N`. Therefore, `x` must be less than or equal to `N` and even, which implies that `x` is a multiple of `2`. Thus, the post-condition is implied by the loop invariants."

If N is even, then x will be even after the loop (because i1 is true). Therefore, we only need to consider the case when N is odd.\n\nPost-condition:\n- The post-condition is that x is even.\n```\n//@ assert(!(x % 2));\n```\nExplanation: We need to show that x is even after the loop. This follows from i1 and i2. If i1 is true, then x is even before the loop. If i2 is true, then x is less than or equal to N after the loop. Since N is an unsigned short, it is always non-negative. Therefore, x is always non-negative. Thus, if x is even before the loop and x is less than or equal to a non-negative number N after the loop, then x is even after the loop."
