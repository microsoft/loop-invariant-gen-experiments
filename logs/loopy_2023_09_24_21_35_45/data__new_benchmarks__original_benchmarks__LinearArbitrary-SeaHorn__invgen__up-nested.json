The loop invariant for the assertion can be expressed as:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant j > n ==> i >= 0; */\n```\n- Since `i` is not modified inside the loop, we can simply use its initial value of `0` as a loop invariant.

Hence, the loop invariant is j <= n.\n- After the loop termination, we want to ensure that i is greater than or equal to 0. However, there are no assignments to i inside the loop, so we can't say anything about the value of i inside the loop. Therefore, we need to use the implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. We know that i is initialized to 0 outside the loop and the loop only executes if j <= n. Hence, we can add the implication (j > n) ==> (i >= 0) to the loop invariant.\n\nBounds:\n- i >= 0 (Given in the post-condition)\n- k >= 0 (Not affected by the loop)\n- j >= INT_MIN (No lower bound on unknown value)\n- n >= INT_MIN (No lower bound on unknown value)\n- j <= INT_MAX (No upper bound on unknown value)\n- n <= INT_MAX (No upper bound on unknown value)\n\nHence, the final loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant j <= n;\n    loop invariant (j > n) ==> (i >= 0);\n*/\n```"

Therefore, `j` is always greater than or equal to its initial value, which is `unknown()`. We can also add a conjunction to bound the maximum value of `j` by `n`: `unknown() <= j <= n`.\n- After the loop termination, `j` is greater than `n` and `i` remains unchanged.
