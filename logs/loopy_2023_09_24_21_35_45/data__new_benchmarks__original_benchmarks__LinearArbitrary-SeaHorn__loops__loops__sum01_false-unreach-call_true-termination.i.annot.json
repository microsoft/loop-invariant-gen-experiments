Therefore, we can add the following loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 1 <= i <= n+1;\n    loop invariant sn == 2*(i-1) || sn == 0;\n*/\n```\n\nThe first loop invariant ensures that `i` is within the bounds of 1 and `n+1` (inclusive) at the beginning of each iteration. The second loop invariant ensures that `sn` is either equal to `2*(i-1)` or 0 at the beginning of each iteration. \n\nNow, let's consider the post-condition:\n\n```\n//@ assert(sn==n*(2)|| sn == 0);\n```\n\nThe post-condition states that `sn` is equal to `n*2` or 0 at the end of the loop. We can use implication to relate the loop invariants to the post-condition:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 1 <= i <= n+1;\n    loop invariant sn == 2*(i-1) || sn == 0;\n    loop invariant (i > n) ==> (sn == n*2 || sn == 0);\n*/\n```\n\nThe third loop invariant states that if `i` is greater than `n` at the end of the loop, then `sn` must be equal to `n*2` or 0. This implication ensures that the loop invariants imply the post-condition.\n\nFinally, since `unknown_uint()` and `unknown()` are non-deterministic functions, we need to use implications to make the loop invariants trivially true at the beginning and end of the loop:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant (n <= 0) ==> (sn == 0);\n    loop invariant (n > 0 && i > n) ==> (sn == n*2 || sn == 0);\n*/\n```\n\nThese implications ensure that the loop invariants are true even if `n` is less than or equal to 0, or if `i` is greater than `n` at the end of the loop.\n\nPutting everything together, we get the following loop invariants for the program:\n\n```\n#define assume(e) if(!(e)) return 0;\nextern int unknown(void);\nextern unsigned int unknown_uint(void);\n\nint main(){\n  int  i,  n=unknown_uint(),  sn=0;\n  assume(n >= 0);\n  for(i=1; i<=n; i++){\n    if(i<10)\n    sn = sn +(2);\n  }\n  assume(i == n+1);\n  assume(n > 0 && i > n ==> sn == n*2 || sn == 0);\n  assert(sn==n*(2)|| sn == 0);\n  return 0;\n}\n\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 1 <= i <= n+1;\n    loop invariant sn == 2*(i-1) || sn == 0;\n    loop invariant (n <= 0) ==> (sn == 0);\n    loop invariant (n > 0 && i > n) ==> (sn == n*2 || sn == 0);\n*/\n```"

Hence, sn is either equal to n*2 or 0.\n- Since i is incremented by 1 in every iteration of the loop and the loop terminates when i becomes n+1, we can infer that i is equal to n+1 after the loop termination.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant sn == (i-1)*2 || sn == 0;\n    loop invariant i <= n+1;\n    loop invariant sn == n*2 || sn == 0 ==> i == n+1;\n*/\n```"
