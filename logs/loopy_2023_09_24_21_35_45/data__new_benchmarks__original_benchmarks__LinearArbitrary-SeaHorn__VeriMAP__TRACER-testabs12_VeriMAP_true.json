Therefore, we can add the following loop invariant before the loop execution:\n\n```\n/*@ loop invariant 0 <= i <= 100;\n    loop invariant count >= 0;\n*/\n```\n\nThe first invariant ensures that `i` is between 0 and 100, while the second invariant ensures that `count` is non-negative.\n\nNow, let's consider the loop body. The loop body increments both `i` and `count`. Therefore, we can add the following loop invariant in every iteration of the loop:\n\n```\n/*@ loop invariant 0 <= i <= 100;\n    loop invariant count >= \\old(count) + i;\n*/\n```\n\nThis invariant ensures that `count` is incremented by `i` in every iteration of the loop.\n\nFinally, let's consider the post-condition. The post-condition asserts that `i` is not greater than 100 and `count` is not less than 0. Since the loop condition is `i < 100`, we can use implication to relate the loop invariant with the post-condition.
