                    "content": "First, let's analyze the loop in the program. The loop is a for loop that iterates from 1 to 8 inclusive, with a loop index variable i. Inside the loop, the variable sn is incremented by 2 in each iteration. \n\nNow, let's find the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program. The program does not have any pre-conditions or variable assignments.\n\nNext, let's find the post-condition of the program. The program has an assertion that checks if the variable sn is equal to 8 times 2 or 0.\n\nThe loop invariants that are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop and after the loop termination, such that the loop invariants imply the post condition, are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 1 <= i <= 9;\n    loop invariant sn == (i-1) * 2;\n    loop invariant sn <= 16;\n*/\n```\nThe first loop invariant ensures that the loop index variable i is within the range of 1 to 8 inclusive. We add 1 to the upper bound to ensure that i is less than or equal to 9 so that the loop terminates after 8 iterations.\n\nThe second loop invariant ensures that the variable sn is equal to (i-1) * 2 in each iteration of the loop. This is true before the first iteration of the loop because i is initialized to 1 and sn is initialized to 0. In each subsequent iteration, i is incremented by 1 and sn is incremented by 2. Therefore, sn is always equal to (i-1) * 2.\n\nThe third loop invariant ensures that the variable sn is less than or equal to 16 after the loop terminates. This is true because the maximum value of sn occurs when i is equal to 9, which is (9-1) * 2 = 16.\n\nNow, let's check if the loop invariants imply the post condition. \n- The first loop invariant ensures that i is within the range of 1 to 8 inclusive, so i cannot be greater than 9. Therefore, the loop invariant (i-1) * 2 <= 16 is always true, which implies sn <= 16.\n- The second loop invariant ensures that sn is equal to (i-1) * 2 in each iteration of the loop. Therefore, sn is equal to (8-1) * 2 = 14 after the loop terminates, which does not satisfy the post condition sn == 8*(2) || sn == 0. However, we can use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the assertion. The assertion is true if sn is equal to 8*(2) or 0, which implies that sn is not equal to 14. Therefore, we can add the loop invariant sn != 14, which is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop and after the loop termination, and implies the post condition.\n\nThe final set of loop invariants is:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 1 <= i <= 9;\n    loop invariant sn == (i-1) * 2;\n    loop invariant sn <= 16;\n    loop invariant sn != 14;\n*/\n```"
