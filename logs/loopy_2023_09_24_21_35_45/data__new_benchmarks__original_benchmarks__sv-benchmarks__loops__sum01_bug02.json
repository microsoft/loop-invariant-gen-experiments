We need to find the necessary loop invariants to help Frama-C verify the post-condition, which states that sn should be equal to either n*a or 0.\n\nLet's begin by analyzing the loop body:\n\n```\nif (i<j) \nsn = sn + a;\nj--;\n```\n\nHere, we see that if i is less than j, then a is added to sn and j is decremented. Otherwise, only j is decremented. Thus, we can conclude that j is non-increasing and i is non-decreasing. \n\nAdditionally, we see that the value of sn only changes when i is less than j. Thus, we can conclude that sn is increasing only when i is less than j.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop condition:\n\n```\nfor(i=1; i<=n; i++)\n```\n\nHere, we see that the loop iterates from 1 to n. Thus, we can conclude that i is less than or equal to n.\n\nBased on our analysis, we can come up with the following loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 1 <= i <= n;\n    loop invariant j >= 0;\n    loop invariant sn == 0 || sn == ((long long) (i-1))*a || sn == ((long long) (i-1))*a + (j*(a-1)); \n*/\n```\n\nExplanation of loop invariants:\n- The loop invariant 1 <= i <= n ensures that i is always within the bounds of the loop.\n- The loop invariant j >= 0 ensures that j is always non-negative.\n- The loop invariant sn == 0 || sn == ((long long) (i-1))*a || sn == ((long long) (i-1))*a + (j*(a-1)) captures the behavior of sn during the loop. \n  - If the loop has not started yet, sn is 0. This is captured by sn == 0.\n  - If the loop has started and i is the current iteration, sn should be equal to (i-1)*a if j is greater than or equal to i. This is captured by sn == ((long long) (i-1))*a.\n  - If the loop has started and i is the current iteration, sn should be equal to (i-1)*a + (j*(a-1)) if j is less than i. This is captured by sn == ((long long) (i-1))*a + (j*(a-1)).\n\nWe can use these loop invariants to help Frama-C verify the post-condition, which states that sn should be equal to either n*a or 0. Since we have captured the behavior of sn during the loop, we can use sn == ((long long) (i-1))*a || sn == ((long long) (i-1))*a + (j*(a-1)) to imply that sn should be equal to either n*a or 0 after the loop terminates. We can express this as:\n\n```\n{;\n    //@ assert (sn == ((long long) (i-1))*a || sn == ((long long) (i-1))*a + (j*(a-1))) ==> (sn == ((long long) n)*a || sn == 0);\n}\n```\n\nNote that we have used implication (==>) to take care of the conditional nature of the code.

This is because `sn` is incremented by `a` only when `i < j`. So, the maximum value of `sn` is `n*a`, which happens when `i` reaches `n+1`. Similarly, the minimum value of `sn` is `0`, which happens when `i` is `1`. Therefore, the third loop invariant ensures that `sn` remains within the bounds of `0` and `n*a` inclusive during the loop execution.\n\nFinally, let's use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code and the guard condition in the assertion:\n```\nfor(i=1; i<=n; i++) {\n    assume(i <= n);\n    assume(9 <= j <= 10);\n    assume(sn == ((long long)(i-1))*a || sn == ((long long) n)*a - ((long long)(i-1))*a);\n    (i<j) ==> (sn + a == ((long long)i)*a || sn + a == ((long long)n)*a - ((long long)i)*a);\n    j--;\n}\nassume(i > n);\nassume(9 <= j <= 10);\nassume(sn == ((long long)(i-1))*a || sn == ((long long) n)*a - ((long long)(i-1))*a);\n(sn == ((long long)n)*a || sn == 0) ==> (sn==((long long) n)*a || sn == 0);\n``` \n\nExplanation:\n- The first three assumptions ensure that the loop invariants hold true before the loop execution. The implication `(i<j) ==> (sn + a == ((long long)i)*a || sn + a == ((long long)n)*a - ((long long)i)*a)` ensures that if the condition `i<j` holds true, then the third loop invariant is updated accordingly. \n- The fourth assumption `(i > n)` ensures that the loop invariants hold true after the loop termination.\n- The fifth assumption `(9 <= j <= 10)` ensures that `j` remains within the bounds of 9 to 10 inclusive during the entire loop execution.\n- The last assumption `(sn == ((long long)n)*a || sn == 0) ==> (sn==((long long) n)*a || sn == 0)` ensures that the post-condition holds true if the guard condition `(sn == ((long long)n)*a || sn == 0)` is true."

If `i` is less than or equal to `j`, then `sn` should be equal to `(i-1)*a` because `i-1` is the number of times that `sn` has been incremented by `a`.

Therefore, `sn` is equal to `a` times the number of times `i` is less than `j`, which is equal to `a` times the number of times `i-1` is less than `10`, which is equal to `a` times `i-1` minus the sum of the first `i-1` integers.

Also, `j` is decremented in every iteration of the loop, so `j` can be at most 10 and `i` can be at most `n`.\n- After the loop termination, `sn` is equal to the sum of `a` from 1 to `n-j` because `a` is added to `sn` only if `i<j`. Since `j` is decremented in every iteration of the loop, `n-j` is the number of times `a` is added to `sn`. Therefore, `sn` is equal to `n*a` if `j >= 1` and `sn` is equal to 0 if `j < 1`.

Here, there are `i-j` occurrences of `a` and `n-i+1` occurrences of 0 in the sequence. This equation can be derived as follows:\n        - Initially, `i=1` and `j=10`. So, `i-j = -9` and `n-i+1 = n-1`. Hence, the sum of the first term of the sequence is `a` and the sum of the remaining terms is `0`. Therefore, `sn = a + 0 = a * 1`.\n        - In each iteration, either `sn` is incremented by `a` or `j` is decremented by 1.

Therefore, `i` should be greater than `n` to satisfy the loop condition. \n- `(sn != 0 && sn != (i-j) * a) ==> i <= n`\n    - This invariant ensures that if `sn` is not equal to 0 and not equal to the sum of the first `i-j` terms of `a` in the sequence, then `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

Therefore, `sn` is equal to `a` times the number of times `i` is less than `j`, which is equal to `a` times the number of times `i-1` is less than `10`, which is equal to `a` times `i-1` minus the sum of the first `i-1` integers. This is captured by the invariant `sn == \\sum_{k=1}^{i-1}{a} && j == 10 - (i-1)`.\n- The loop condition is `i<=n`, so `i` cannot exceed `n+1`.\n- The variable `j` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, so it cannot be negative.\n- The sum `sn` is incremented by `a` in each iteration, so it is less than or equal to `n*a`.\n- After the loop termination, `sn` is the sum of `a` from `1` to `n` if `i` is less than or equal to `n`, and it is the sum of `a` from `1` to `n` plus a multiple of `a` if `i` is greater than `n`. This is captured by the invariant `sn == \\sum_{k=1}^{i-1}{a} && j == 10 - (i-1) && i == n+1` if `i <= n`, and by the invariant `sn == \\sum_{k=1}^{n}{a} && j == 10 - n && i == n+1` if `i > n`.\n- The assertion is guarded by the condition `;`, which is always true.

Here, there are `i-j` occurrences of `a` and `n-i+1` occurrences of 0 in the sequence. This equation can be derived as follows:\n        - Initially, `i=1` and `j=10`. So, `i-j = -9` and `n-i+1 = n-1`. Hence, the sum of the first term of the sequence is `a` and the sum of the remaining terms is `0`. Therefore, `sn = a + 0 = a * 1`.\n        - In each iteration, either `sn` is incremented by `a` or `j` is decremented by 1. Therefore, the difference between the sum of `i-j` terms of `a` and `n-i+1` terms of 0 remains constant at `a * (i-j)`.\n        - At the end of the loop, `i=n+1` and `j=9`. So, `i-j = n+1-9 = n-8` and `n-i+1 = 1`. Hence, the sum of the first `n` terms of the sequence is `a*n` and the sum of the remaining terms is `0`.\n- `sn == 0 ==> i > n`\n    - This invariant ensures that if `sn` is equal to 0, then the loop has terminated and `i` is greater than `n`. This is because, if `sn` is 0, then all the terms in the sequence are 0 and the loop has run for exactly `n` iterations. Therefore, `i` should be greater than `n` to satisfy the loop condition. \n- `(sn != 0 && sn != (i-j) * a) ==> i <= n`\n    - This invariant ensures that if `sn` is not equal to 0 and not equal to the sum of the first `i-j` terms of `a` in the sequence, then `i` is less than or equal to `n`.
