It is true in every iteration of the loop because `x` is incremented by `1` in each iteration. It also holds after the loop termination because the loop terminates when `x` becomes `6`.\n- `y == 2^x` holds before the loop execution because `x` is initialized to `0` and `y` is initialized to `1`, which satisfies the equation. It is true in every iteration of the loop because `y` is multiplied by `2` in each iteration, which is equivalent to raising `2` to the power of `x+1`. It also holds after the loop termination because `x` becomes `6` and `y` becomes `2^6=64`.\n\nFinally, let's use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code and to handle the assertion:\n```\n#define assume(e) if(!(e)) return 0;\n\nint main(void) {\n  unsigned int x = 0;\n  unsigned int y = 1;\n\n  while (x < 6) {\n    /*@ \n        loop invariant x <= 6;\n        loop invariant y == 2^x;\n    */\n    x++;\n    y *= 2;\n  }\n\n  assume(y != 12); // equivalent to if (y == 12) return 0;\n\n  return 0;\n}\n```\nNote that we used the `assume` macro to convert the assertion guard into an implication.

Therefore, the loop invariant y == 2^x holds before the loop execution.\n- In every iteration of the loop:\n    - In each iteration, x is incremented by 1, and y is multiplied by 2. Therefore, after i iterations, y will be equal to 2^i. Since x starts from 0, we have i = x, and hence y = 2^x. Therefore, the loop invariant y == 2^x holds in every iteration of the loop.\n    - Since y is multiplied by 2 in each iteration, it follows that 1 <= y <= 2^x holds in every iteration of the loop.\n    - x is incremented by 1 in each iteration, and it starts from 0. Since the loop terminates when x becomes greater than or equal to 6, it follows that 1 <= x <= 6 holds in every iteration of the loop.\n- After the loop termination:\n    - After the loop terminates, x is 6, and hence y is equal to 2^6, which is 64. Therefore, the loop invariant y == 2^6 holds after the loop termination.\n    - The assertion y != 12 is guarded by the condition x >= 7 (since y = 12 if and only if x = 3). Therefore, we can use implication to incorporate the guard condition in the loop invariant. If y != 12, then x >= 7. Therefore, we can add the loop invariant y != 12 ==> x >= 7 after the loop termination.\n\nTherefore, the final loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant y == 2^x;\n    loop invariant 1 <= y <= 2^x;\n    loop invariant 1 <= x <= 6;\n    loop invariant y == 64;\n    loop invariant y != 12 ==> x >= 7;\n*/\n```"

This is true because `y` is multiplied by 2 in every iteration of the loop, and `x` is incremented by 1 in every iteration. Therefore, `y` will always be equal to 2 raised to the power of `x`.\n\nFinally, let's find the loop invariants that hold true after the loop termination:\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant x >= 6;\n  loop invariant y == 64;\n  loop invariant y != 12 ==> x == 6;\n*/\n```\nExplanation:\n- Since the loop condition checks if `x` is less than 6, and `x` is incremented by 1 in every iteration of the loop, the loop will terminate when `x` becomes greater than or equal to 6. Therefore, the first loop invariant states that `x` is greater than or equal to 6 after the loop termination.\n- Since `y` is multiplied by 2 in every iteration of the loop and is initialized to 1, its value after the loop termination will be 64. Therefore, the second loop invariant states that `y` is equal to 64 after the loop termination.\n- The assertion `y != 12` is guarded by no condition, but it is still valid to use an implication in the loop invariant. The third loop invariant states that if `y` is not equal to 12, then `x` must be equal to 6. This is true because if `y` is not equal to 12, then `y` must have been multiplied by 2 six times, which means that `x` must have been incremented by 6, making it equal to 6 after the loop termination."

Hence, `y` is always a power of 2 and greater than or equal to 1. This satisfies the first part of the second loop invariant `1 <= y`. The second part of the loop invariant is `y == 2^x` which is true for every iteration of the loop.\n- After the loop termination, `x` is equal to 6 and `y` is equal to `2^6` which satisfies the first part of the third loop invariant `x == 6 ==> y == 2^6`.
