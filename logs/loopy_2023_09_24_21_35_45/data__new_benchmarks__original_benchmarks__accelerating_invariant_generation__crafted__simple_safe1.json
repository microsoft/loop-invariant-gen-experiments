The variable `x` is assigned the value 0.\n\nStep 2: Loop condition\n```\nwhile (x < 0x0fffffff)\n```\nThe loop condition is that `x` should be less than `0x0fffffff`.\n\nStep 3: Loop invariants\nLet's analyze the loop body to derive the loop invariants.\n\n1. Before the loop execution:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x <= 0x0fffffff;\n*/\n```\nExplanation: Before the loop execution, `x` is assigned the value 0. Since `0 <= 0x0fffffff`, the loop invariant that `x` should be less than or equal to `0x0fffffff` is true.\n\n2. In every iteration of the loop:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x % 2 == 0 ==> (\\old(x) + 2) % 2 == 0;\n*/\n```\nExplanation: In every iteration of the loop, `x` is incremented by 2. If `x` is even before the increment, it should remain even after the increment. This is captured in the loop invariant that if `x` is divisible by 2, then the value of `x` after the increment should also be divisible by 2.\n\n3. After the loop termination:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x % 2 == 0;\n*/\n```\nExplanation: After the loop termination, the loop condition `x < 0x0fffffff` is false. This means that `x` should be greater than or equal to `0x0fffffff`. Also, since `x` is incremented by 2 in each iteration, it must be an even number. Therefore, the loop invariant that `x` should be even is true after the loop termination.\n\nPutting all the loop invariants together, we get:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x <= 0x0fffffff;\n    loop invariant x % 2 == 0 ==> (\\old(x) + 2) % 2 == 0;\n    loop invariant x % 2 == 0;\n*/\n```\nNote that we have used the implication operator (`==>`), as instructed, to handle the conditional nature of the code. We have also used the `\\old` operator to refer to the value of `x` before the increment. Since `x` is deterministic (i.e., its value is known and not non-deterministic), we do not need to use any implications to make the invariants trivially true at any location."
