We need to find loop invariants that are true:\n(i) before the loop execution,\n(ii) in every iteration of the loop, and\n(iii) after the loop termination, such that the loop invariants imply the post-condition.\n\n(i) Before the loop execution, `glob3_dc` is equal to 0 and `glob3_pathend_off` and `glob3_pathlim_off` are initialized with `buf_off` and `bound_off` respectively.

The program initializes several variables and assumes that `MAXPATHLEN` is greater than 0. The program also has a non-deterministic integer `__BLAST_NONDET`.\n\nNow, let's output the necessary loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= glob3_dc; // glob3_dc is always non-negative\n    loop invariant glob3_dc < MAXPATHLEN + 1; // glob3_dc is always less than MAXPATHLEN+1\n    loop invariant glob3_pathend_off + glob3_dc <= glob3_pathlim_off; // loop condition is true\n    loop invariant glob3_pathlim_off == bound_off; // glob3_pathlim_off is initialized to bound_off\n    loop invariant glob3_pathbuf_off == buf_off; // glob3_pathbuf_off is initialized to buf_off\n    loop invariant glob3_pattern_off == pattern_off; // glob3_pattern_off is initialized to pattern_off\n    loop invariant 0 <= buf_off; // buf_off is always non-negative\n    loop invariant buf_off <= MAXPATHLEN; // buf_off is always less than or equal to MAXPATHLEN\n    loop invariant 0 <= pattern_off; // pattern_off is always non-negative\n    loop invariant 0 <= bound_off; // bound_off is always non-negative\n    loop invariant bound_off == 0 + (MAXPATHLEN + 1) - 1; // bound_off is initialized correctly\n    loop invariant MAXPATHLEN > 0; // pre-condition\n    loop invariant (__BLAST_NONDET ==> \\false); // assertion is guarded by __BLAST_NONDET\n*/\n```\n\nNote that the last loop invariant uses an implication to make the invariant trivially true when `__BLAST_NONDET` is true. This is because we cannot make any assumptions about the value of `__BLAST_NONDET` and hence we cannot assume anything about the value of `glob3_dc` or the loop condition when `__BLAST_NONDET` is true."
