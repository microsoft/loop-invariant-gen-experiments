The program initializes an unsigned integer variable `n` with an unknown value, and then assigns the value of `n` to two unsigned integer variables `x` and `y`. The while loop decrements the value of `x` and increments the value of `y` until `x` becomes 0. Finally, the program checks if `y` is not equal to the initial value of `n`.\n\nNext, let's find the necessary loop invariants for the while loop. \n\nPre-conditions: None.\n\nLoop condition: `x>0`.\n\nPost-condition: `y!=n`.\n\nLoop Invariants:\n- `x>=0`: Since `x` is decremented in each iteration, it can never be negative.\n- `y<=n`: Since `y` is incremented in each iteration, it can never be greater than the initial value of `n`.\n- `x+y==n`: The sum of `x` and `y` remains constant throughout the loop.\n- `(x>0) ==> (y!=n)`: If `x` is greater than 0, then `y` is not equal to the initial value of `n`. This is an implication that takes care of the conditional nature of the loop and the assertion.\n\nPutting everything together, the loop invariants for the while loop are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x>=0;\n    loop invariant y<=n;\n    loop invariant x+y==n;\n    loop invariant (x>0) ==> (y!=n);\n*/\n``` \n\nNote that we don't need to add any implications for non-deterministic values, because all variables are initialized with unknown values and we cannot make any assumptions about them."
