For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values. Do not use variables that have garbage values.**\n- **Do not use keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops.**\n- **Variables that are not explicitly initialized, could have garbage values.

Here are some possible loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@\nloop invariant x <= n1;\nloop invariant sn == x * 2 || sn == 0;\nloop invariant x <= loop1 + 10;\nloop invariant x >= loop1 ==> sn == (x - loop1) * 2;\nloop invariant x < loop1 ==> sn == 0;\n*/\n```\n\nExplanation of the loop invariants:\n- The first loop invariant states that `x` is always less than or equal to `n1`, which is the non-deterministic unsigned integer that is assigned a value at the beginning of the program. This invariant ensures that the loop does not run forever and that `x` stays within a valid range.\n- The second loop invariant states that `sn` is either equal to `x * 2` or equal to 0. This invariant holds in every iteration of the loop and ensures that the property `sn == x * 2 || sn == 0` holds at the end of the loop.\n- The third loop invariant states that `x` is always less than or equal to `loop1 + 10`, which ensures that the loop does not run forever.\n- The fourth loop invariant states that if `x` is greater than or equal to `loop1`, then `sn` is equal to `(x - loop1) * 2`. This invariant ensures that if `x` is greater than or equal to `loop1`, then `sn` is updated correctly according to the program logic.\n- The fifth loop invariant states that if `x` is less than `loop1`, then `sn` is equal to 0. This invariant ensures that if `x` is less than `loop1`, then `sn` remains 0 according to the program logic.\n\nNote that we used implication in the fourth and fifth loop invariants to handle the conditional nature of the program.\n\nWe also added conjunctions to bound the maximum and minimum values that `x` can take, as well as to relate `sn` and `x` to each other. The bounds on `x` ensure that the loop terminates, while the relation between `sn` and `x` ensures that the program logic is followed correctly.\n\nFinally, we used an implication in the loop invariants to handle the non-deterministic values of `loop1` and `n1` at the beginning of the loop. This ensures that the loop invariants are trivially true at the beginning of the loop."

            "ERROR: Output does not contain at least 1 code block\nOutput:\nPre-conditions or variable assignments:\n- The macro `assume(e)` takes an expression `e` as input and returns 0 if `e` is false. Otherwise, it does nothing.\n- There are two external functions `unknown()` and `unknown_uint()` that are not defined in the program. We cannot make any assumptions about their behavior.\n- The variable `sn` is initialized to 0.\n- The variables `loop1` and `n1` are initialized to non-deterministic unsigned integer values.\n- The variable `x` is initialized to 0.\n\nLoop condition:\n- The loop condition is `while(1)`. This means that the loop will execute indefinitely unless a `break` statement is used to exit the loop.\n\nLoop body analysis:\n- If `x` is less than 10, then `sn` is updated to `sn + 2`.\n- `x` is incremented by 1.\n- There is an assertion that checks if `sn` is equal to `x * 2` or 0.\n\nLoop invariants:\n- Before the loop execution:\n    - `sn >= 0`\n    - `x == 0`\n    - `loop1 >= 0`\n    - `n1 >= 0`\n- In every iteration of the loop:\n    - `x >= 0`\n    - `sn >= 0`\n    - `x <= loop1`\n    - `loop1 >= 0`\n    - `n1 >= 0`\n    - `(x < 10) ==> (sn == x * 2)`\n    - `(x >= 10) ==> (sn == 0)`\n- After the loop termination:\n    - `(x >= loop1) ==> (sn == x * 2)`\n    - `(x < loop1) ==> (sn == 0)`\n\nExplanation:\n- Before the loop execution, we know that `sn` is initialized to 0 and `x` is initialized to 0. `loop1` and `n1` are non-deterministic unsigned integers, so we cannot make any assumptions about their values. Therefore, we can only say that they are greater than or equal to 0.\n- In every iteration of the loop, we know that `x` is incremented by 1 and that `sn` is updated to `sn + 2` if `x` is less than 10. Therefore, `x` and `sn` must be greater than or equal to 0. Also, `x` must be less than or equal to `loop1` since `loop1` is non-deterministic and could represent the number of iterations of the loop. `loop1` and `n1` are non-deterministic unsigned integers, so we cannot make any assumptions about their values. \n- Inside the loop, there is an assertion that checks if `sn` is equal to `x * 2` or 0. If `x` is less than 10, then `sn` is equal to `x * 2`. If `x` is greater than or equal to 10, then `sn` is equal to 0. Therefore, we can add these implications to the loop invariant.\n- After the loop termination, `x` must be greater than or equal to `loop1` since `loop1` is non-deterministic and could represent the number of iterations of the loop. If `x` is greater than or equal to `loop1`, then `sn` must be equal to `x * 2`. Otherwise, if `x` is less than `loop1`, then `sn` must be equal to 0. Therefore, we can add these implications to the loop invariant.",
