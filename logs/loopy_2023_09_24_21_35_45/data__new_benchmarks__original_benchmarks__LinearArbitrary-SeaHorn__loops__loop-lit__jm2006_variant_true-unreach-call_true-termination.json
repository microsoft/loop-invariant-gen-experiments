Given a program, you can find loop invariants, which can then be used to verify some property in the program. \nFrama-C is a software verification tool for C programs. The input to Frama-C is a C program file with ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations.\nFor the given program, find the necessary loop invariants of the while loop to help Frama-C verify the post-condition.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. \n- Output loop invariants that are true \n(i) before the loop execution, \n(ii) in every iteration of the loop and \n(iii) after the loop termination, \nsuch that the loop invariants imply the post condition.\n- If a loop invariant is a conjunction, split it into its parts.\n- Output all the loop invariants in one code block. For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values.

Also, `x + y + 2 * z` remains equal to `i + j` because we are just subtracting 1 from `x` and 2 from `y` in each iteration and adding 1 to `z`.\n- After the loop, `x` becomes 0, so we can add the invariant `x == 0`.

Therefore, `0 <= x <= i`, `0 <= y <= j`, and `0 <= z <= i`. Also, `x + y + 2 * z` remains equal to `i + j` because we are just subtracting 1 from `x` and 2 from `y` in each iteration and adding 1 to `z`.\n- After the loop, `x` becomes 0, so we can add the invariant `x == 0`. Also, we know that `j` has decreased by `2 * z`, so we add the invariant `j == y + z`.\n- Finally, we have an assertion that is guarded by the condition `(i == j)`. Therefore, we can add the invariant `((i == j) ==> (y == -z))`. This invariant is equivalent to `((i != j) || (y == -z))`, which means that if `i` is not equal to `j`, then the invariant is trivially true, and if `i` is equal to `j`, then `y` must be equal to `-z`.",
