Since `i` and `j` represent the number of times the conditions `b == 1` and `b == 0` respectively, they should be greater than or equal to `0`. Also, `n` should be `0` before the loop starts and `b` can only be `0` or `1`.\n- In every iteration of the loop, the sum of `i` and `j` should be equal to the current value of `n`. This is because `i` represents the number of times `b` is `1` and `j` represents the number of times `b` is `0`. Also, if `n` is less than `k`, then `b` is `0` and if `n` is between `k` and `2*k`, then `b` is `1`.\n- After the loop, the number of times `b` was `1` (represented by `i`) should be equal to the number of times `b` was `0` (represented by `j`), since the loop alternates between `b == 1` and `b == 0`.",

If `b` is `0`, then `i` and `j` must be `0` since the loop has not executed yet. If `b` is `1`, then `i` and `j` must also be `0` since the first iteration will increment `i` and set `b` to `0`.

The variable `k` is initialized to 100 and is never modified in the loop.\n2. The variable `b` is initialized to 0 and is flipped between 0 and 1 in each iteration of the loop.\n3. The variables `i` and `j` are initially non-deterministic, but are set to 0 before the loop. They are incremented in each iteration of the loop based on the value of `b`.\n4. The loop iterates `2*k` times.\n\nNow, let's find the necessary loop invariants:\n\n1. Before the loop execution:\n   - `k == 100`\n   - `b == 0`\n   - `i == 0`\n   - `j == 0`\n   - `n == 0`\n2.

After the loop termination:\n   - `i + j == 2*k`\n   - `b == 0 || b == 1`\n\nLet's explain each invariant:\n\n1. Before the loop execution:\n   - `k == 100`: this invariant simply states that `k` has a fixed value of 100 before the loop starts.\n   - `b == 0`: this invariant simply states that `b` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.\n   - `i == 0`: this invariant simply states that `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.\n   - `j == 0`: this invariant simply states that `j` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.\n   - `n == 0`: this invariant simply states that `n` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.\n2. In every iteration of the loop:\n   - `n >= 0 && n <= 2*k`: this invariant states that `n` is always between 0 and 2*k inclusive.\n   - `i + j == n/2`: this invariant states that the sum of `i` and `j` is always equal to half of the current value of `n`.\n   - `b == 0 || b == 1`: this invariant states that `b` is either 0 or 1.\n3. After the loop termination:\n   - `i + j == 2*k`: this invariant states that the sum of `i` and `j` is equal to 2*k after the loop termination.\n   - `b == 0 || b == 1`: this invariant states that `b` is either 0 or 1 after the loop termination.\n\nNote that we did not need to use any implication in this case, since there are no conditional statements inside the loop. Also note that we added bounds for `n` since it is used in the loop condition, and we added the relation `i + j == n/2` since `i` and `j` are incremented based on the value of `b`. Finally, we added the invariant `i + j == 2*k` since it implies the post-condition `i == j` through simple algebraic manipulation.",
