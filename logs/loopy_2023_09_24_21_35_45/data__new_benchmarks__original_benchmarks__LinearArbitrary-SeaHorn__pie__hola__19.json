Therefore, `x` is always between 0 and `n` inclusive.\n\n**Invariant 2:**\n```\n/*@ loop invariant m <= y <= n;\n*/\n```\nExplanation: `y` starts with `m` and increases by 1 only when `x` is greater than `m`. Therefore, `y` is always between `m` and `n` inclusive.\n\n**Invariant 3:**\n```\n/*@ loop invariant y == m + (x - m);\n*/\n```\nExplanation: This invariant uses the relationship between `x` and `y`. If `x` is greater than `m`, then `y` is incremented by 1. Thus, `y` is equal to `m` plus the number of times `x` is greater than `m`. This is equivalent to `m + (x - m)`.\n\n**Invariant 4:**\n```\n/*@ loop invariant \\forall integer i; m <= i < x ==> y == m + (i - m);\n*/\n```\nExplanation: This invariant is similar to invariant 3, but it quantifies over all values of `i` between `m` and `x-1`, inclusive. It states that for all values of `i` between `m` and `x-1`, `y` is equal to `m` plus the difference between `i` and `m`. This is true because `y` is incremented by 1 each time `x` is greater than `m`.\n\n**Invariant 5:**\n```\n/*@ loop invariant x <= n ==> y == m + (x - m);\n*/\n```\nExplanation: This invariant is similar to invariant 3, but it only holds when `x` is less than or equal to `n`. This is because `y` stops changing once `x` becomes greater than `n`.\n\n**Invariant 6:**\n```\n/*@ loop invariant x <= n ==> \\forall integer i; m <= i < x ==> y == m + (i - m);\n*/\n```\nExplanation: This invariant is similar to invariant 4, but it only holds when `x` is less than or equal to `n`. This is because `y` stops changing once `x` becomes greater than `n`.\n\n**Invariant 7:**\n```\n/*@ loop invariant y <= n;\n*/\n```\nExplanation: This invariant is necessary for the post-condition to hold. Since the post-condition states that `y` must be equal to `n`, `y` must always be less than or equal to `n`.\n\nCombining all these loop invariants, we get the following:\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant 0 <= x <= n;\n  loop invariant m <= y <= n;\n  loop invariant y == m + (x - m);\n  loop invariant \\forall integer i; m <= i < x ==> y == m + (i - m);\n  loop invariant x <= n ==> y == m + (x - m);\n  loop invariant x <= n ==> \\forall integer i; m <= i < x ==> y == m + (i - m);\n  loop invariant y <= n;\n*/\n```\nNote: We did not need to use any implications in this program."

Hence, we have `(y == x+m)`.\n- Since the loop condition is `x < n`, we can use an implication to state that if the loop terminates, then `x >= n`. Hence, we have `(x >= n) ==> (y == n)`.\n- Finally, since the assertion is guarded by the condition `n >= 0 && m >= 0 && m < n`, we can use an implication to state that the loop invariant implies the post-condition only if the guard condition is true.
