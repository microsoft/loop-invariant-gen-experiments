We can also see that the program checks that `i` is 0, `n` is between 0 and 100, and `sum` is 0, before entering the loop. \n\nBased on this information, we can add the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= i <= 100;\n    loop invariant 0 <= n <= 100;\n    loop invariant sum == (i*(i-1))/2;\n*/\n```\n\nThe first two loop invariants bound the values of `i` and `n` to be between 0 and 100. The third loop invariant is derived from the fact that `sum` is the sum of all integers from 0 to `i-1`. Therefore, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to express `sum` in terms of `i`.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body. The loop adds the value of `i` to `sum` and increments `i` in each iteration. Therefore, the value of `sum` at the end of the loop should be the sum of all integers from 0 to `n-1`. We can express this as follows:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= i <= 100;\n    loop invariant 0 <= n <= 100;\n    loop invariant sum == (i*(i-1))/2;\n    loop invariant sum == (i-1)*i/2 ==> sum+i == (i*(i+1))/2;\n*/\n```\nThe fourth loop invariant expresses that if `sum` is the sum of all integers from 0 to `i-1`, then `sum+i` is the sum of all integers from 0 to `i`. We use implication to express that this relation holds only if `sum` is the sum of all integers from 0 to `i-1`.\n\nFinally, we need to ensure that the loop invariants imply the post-condition. The post-condition is `sum >= 0`. We can use the third loop invariant to express that `sum` is always non-negative:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= i <= 100;\n    loop invariant 0 <= n <= 100;\n    loop invariant sum == (i*(i-1))/2;\n    loop invariant sum == (i-1)*i/2 ==> sum+i == (i*(i+1))/2;\n    loop invariant sum >= 0;\n*/\n```\nThis set of loop invariants ensures that `sum` is non-negative throughout the loop, and that it is equal to the sum of all integers from 0 to `n-1` at the end of the loop. Therefore, the post-condition is implied by these loop invariants."

The conditional statement checks that `i` is 0, `n` is between 0 and 100 (inclusive), and `sum` is 0. If the condition is not satisfied, the program returns 0. \n\nNext, let's analyze the loop body and the loop condition:\n```\nwhile (i<n) {\n  sum = sum + i;\n  i++;\n}\n```\nThe loop condition is `i<n`, which means the loop executes as long as `i` is less than `n`. The loop body increments the value of `i` by 1 and adds the current value of `i` to `sum`.\n\nNow, we can output the loop invariants. We need to find invariants that are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination, such that the invariants imply the post-condition `sum>=0`.\n\nBefore the loop execution, we can add the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant i>=0;\n  loop invariant n>=0 && n<=100;\n  loop invariant sum>=0;\n*/\n```\nThese invariants bound the minimum value that `i` can take, the minimum and maximum values that `n` can take, and the minimum value that `sum` can take. \n\nIn every iteration of the loop, we can add the following loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant i<=n;\n  loop invariant sum>=i*(i-1)/2;\n*/\n```\nThe first invariant ensures that `i` remains less than `n` throughout the loop execution. The second invariant is derived from the fact that the loop adds `i` to `sum` in each iteration. Thus, after `i` iterations, `sum` is at least `1+2+...+i = i*(i-1)/2`.\n\nAfter the loop termination, we can add the following loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant sum>=i*(i-1)/2 ==> sum>=0;\n*/\n```\nThis invariant uses implication to state that if `sum` is greater than or equal to `i*(i-1)/2` at the end of the loop, then `sum` is also greater than or equal to 0. Since `i` is greater than or equal to `n` at the end of the loop, we know that `sum` is at least `n*(n-1)/2`, which implies that `sum>=0`.\n\nPutting everything together, we get the following program with loop invariants:\n```\n#define assume(e) if(!(e)) return 0;\nextern int unknown(void);\nextern int unknown_int(void);\n\n#include <assert.h>\n\nint main() {\n  int i = unknown_int();\n  int n = unknown_int();\n  int sum = unknown_int();\n  \n  assume(i==0 && n>=0 && n<=100 && sum==0);\n  /*@ \n    loop invariant i>=0;\n    loop invariant n>=0 && n<=100;\n    loop invariant sum>=0;\n    loop invariant i<=n;\n    loop invariant sum>=i*(i-1)/2;\n  */\n  while (i<n) {\n    sum = sum + i;\n    i++;\n  }\n  /*@\n    loop invariant sum>=i*(i-1)/2 ==> sum>=0;\n    loop invariant sum>=0;\n  */\n  assert(sum>=0);\n  return 0;\n}\n```"

However, since sum must be equal to 0 according to the pre-condition, it follows that sum is greater than or equal to 0 before the loop execution.\n4. sum+i>=0 (in every iteration of the loop)\n    - This invariant is true because sum and i are both non-negative integers, so their sum is also non-negative.\n5. i<n ==> i+1<=n (in every iteration of the loop)\n    - This invariant is true because the loop condition is i<n, so if i is less than n in an iteration, then i+1 must be less than or equal to n in the next iteration.\n6. i<n ==> sum+i<=n*(n-1)/2 (in every iteration of the loop)\n    - This invariant is true because sum is the sum of the first i integers, which is equal to i*(i-1)/2. Therefore, sum+i is equal to i*(i-1)/2 + i, which simplifies to i*(i+1)/2. Since i<n according to the loop condition, it follows that i+1<=n, and therefore i*(i+1)/2 is less than or equal to n*(n-1)/2. Thus, sum+i is less than or equal to n*(n-1)/2 in every iteration of the loop.\n7. i>=n ==> sum>=0 (after the loop termination)\n    - This invariant is true because if i is greater than or equal to n after the loop termination, then the loop condition i<n is false, and the loop is not executed. Therefore, sum remains unchanged from its value before the loop execution, which is non-negative according to invariant 3. Thus, sum is greater than or equal to 0 after the loop termination.\n8. i<n ==> sum<=n*(n-1)/2 (after the loop termination)\n    - This invariant is true because if i is less than n after the loop termination, then the loop condition i<n is false, and the loop is not executed for i=n. Therefore, sum is equal to the sum of the first n integers, which is equal to n*(n-1)/2 according to the Gauss formula. Thus, sum is less than or equal to n*(n-1)/2 after the loop termination.\n\nOutput:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i>=0;\n    loop invariant i<=n;\n    loop invariant sum>=0;\n    loop invariant sum+i>=0;\n    loop invariant i<n ==> i+1<=n;\n    loop invariant i<n ==> sum+i<=n*(n-1)/2;\n    loop invariant i>=n ==> sum>=0;\n    loop invariant i<n ==> sum<=n*(n-1)/2;\n*/\n```"

If `i` is equal to `n` at the end of the loop, then `sum` is the sum of integers from 0 to `n-1`.

The second invariant ensures that `n` is between 0 and 100, inclusive, which is true because `n` is initialized to an unknown integer value. The third invariant ensures that `sum` is the sum of all integers from 0 to `i-1`, which is true because `sum` is initialized to 0 and updated by adding `i` in each iteration of the loop.\n\nIn every iteration of the loop, we have the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant 0 <= i <= 100;\n  loop invariant n >= 0 && n <= 100;\n  loop invariant sum == (i*(i-1))/2;\n*/\n```\nThe first two invariants are the same as before and ensure that `i` and `n` are within their bounds. The third invariant ensures that `sum` is updated correctly in each iteration of the loop. We can prove this by induction. At the beginning of the loop (`i=0`), `sum` is 0, which is equal to `(i*(i-1))/2`. Assume that the invariant holds for some `i=k`. Then, at the end of the `k`-th iteration, `sum` is updated to `sum+k`, which is equal to `((k+1)*k)/2` according to the third invariant. Therefore, the invariant holds for `i=k+1`.\n\nAfter the loop termination, we have the following loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant sum == (i*(i-1))/2 ==> sum >= 0;\n*/\n```\nThis invariant ensures that if the previous invariant holds (`sum == (i*(i-1))/2`), then the post-condition `sum>=0` is also true. This is true because `sum == (i*(i-1))/2` implies that `sum` is the sum of all integers from 0 to `i-1`, which is always non-negative.\n\nPutting all the loop invariants together, we have:\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant 0 <= i <= 100;\n  loop invariant n >= 0 && n <= 100;\n  loop invariant sum == (i*(i-1))/2;\n\n  loop invariant sum == (i*(i-1))/2 ==> sum >= 0;\n*/\n```"
