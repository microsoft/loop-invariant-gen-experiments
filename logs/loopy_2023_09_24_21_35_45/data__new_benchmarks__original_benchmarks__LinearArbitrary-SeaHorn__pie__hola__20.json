Hence, the condition `(j>=0) && (j<=n)` holds true. Additionally, the values of `x` and `y` change inside the loop. The condition `((j<i) ==> (y>x)) && ((j>=i) ==> (y<x))` ensures that if `j<i`, then `y>x` and if `j>=i`, then `y<x`. This condition ensures that `x` and `y` are swapped every time `j` is not equal to `i`.\n- After the loop terminates, the assertion `((x+y)==k)` still holds true since it was true before the loop started and the loop does not modify the value of `x` and `y` when `n<=0`. The condition `(n<=0) || ((0<=m) && (m<n)))` ensures that if `n>0`, then `m` is between 0 and `n-1`. If `n<=0`, then the assertion is trivially true. \n\nNote: Since the `unknown1()` function returns non-deterministic values, we cannot make any assumptions about the initial values of `x`, `y`, `k`, `j`, `i`, and `n`. However, we can still reason about their bounds in the loop invariants."

This ensures that the loop body satisfies the given condition for all iterations after the current iteration.\n- The fifth loop invariant ensures that if the loop terminates (i.e., j == n), then the variable m falls within the bounds of 0 and n.
