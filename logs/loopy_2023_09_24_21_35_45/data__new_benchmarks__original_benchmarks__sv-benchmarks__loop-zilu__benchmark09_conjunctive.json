This is because both `x` and `y` are decremented in every iteration of the loop, and we want to ensure that they do not become negative.\n- The second invariant ensures that the sum of `x` and `y` remains constant throughout the loop. This is because both `x` and `y` are decremented by 1 in every iteration of the loop. Therefore, the sum of `x` and `y` will remain constant if it is initially constant.\n- The third invariant ensures that `y` becomes 0 when `x` becomes 0. This is because the loop terminates when `x` becomes 0, and we want to ensure that `y` also becomes 0 at this point. This is achieved by the implication `(x == 0) ==> (y == 0)`. If `x` is 0, then the right-hand side of the implication is true, which means that `y` is 0. \n\nPutting it all together, we get the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0 && y >= 0;\n    loop invariant x + y == \\at(x+y, Pre);\n    loop invariant (x == 0) ==> (y == 0);\n*/\n``` \n\nNote: We do not need to add any invariants for non-deterministic values of `x` and `y` at the beginning of the loop, because we are not making any assumptions about their initial values.

Before loop execution, `y >= 0 && x == y`: Since `y` is initialized with a non-negative value and `x` is initialized with the same non-negative value as `y`, it follows that `y` must be greater than or equal to 0 and `x` must be equal to `y`.\n\n2.

This relation is maintained in every iteration of the loop. We use `\\old` to refer to the value of `x` and `y` before the loop body was executed.\n\n3. After loop termination, `y == 0`: Since the loop condition is `x!=0`, it follows that `x` must have been decremented all the way to 0.
