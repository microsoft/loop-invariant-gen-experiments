Since i is equal to n, this invariant implies that k is non-negative.\n- The fourth invariant states that the sum of 2*k and n is greater than or equal to 1.

This invariant is also true in every iteration of the loop because `i` is incremented by 2, which means it remains less than or equal to `n`. This invariant is true after the loop because `i >= n`, and since `i` is less than or equal to `n`, it must also be less than or equal to `n`.\n\n3. `k >= 0`:\nThis invariant is true before the loop because of the pre-condition. This invariant is also true in every iteration of the loop because `k` is decremented by 1, which means it remains non-negative. This invariant is true after the loop because `k` is greater than or equal to `0` and is not changed after the loop.\n\n4. `k <= n`:\nThis invariant is true before the loop because of the pre-condition. This invariant is also true in every iteration of the loop because `k` is decremented by 1, which means it remains less than or equal to `n`. This invariant is true after the loop because `k` is less than or equal to `n` and is not changed after the loop.\n\n5. `i % 2 == 0`:\nThis invariant is true before the loop because `i` is initialized to an unknown integer value, which could be any even or odd integer. This invariant is also true in every iteration of the loop because `i` is incremented by 2, which means it remains even. This invariant is true after the loop because `i >= n`, and since `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` must also be non-negative and even.\n\n6. `k + i <= n`:\nThis invariant is true before the loop because of the pre-condition. This invariant is also true in every iteration of the loop because `k` is decremented by 1 and `i` is incremented by 2, which means their sum remains less than or equal to `n`. This invariant is true after the loop because `k + i` is equal to `n`, which means `k + i` is less than or equal to `n`.\n\n7. `2*k + i >= n-1`:\nThis invariant is true before the loop because of the pre-condition. This invariant is also true in every iteration of the loop because `k` is decremented by 1 and `i` is incremented by 2, which means their sum is increased by `1`. Hence, this invariant implies that `2*k + i >= n-1` after every iteration of the loop. This invariant is true after the loop because `i >= n`, and therefore `2*k + i` is greater than or equal to `2*n`. Since `2*k + i >= n-1` holds after every iteration of the loop, it also holds after the loop.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@\n  loop invariant 0 <= i;\n  loop invariant i <= n;\n  loop invariant 0 <= k;\n  loop invariant k <= n;\n  loop invariant i % 2 == 0;\n  loop invariant k + i <= n;\n  loop invariant 2*k + i >=",
