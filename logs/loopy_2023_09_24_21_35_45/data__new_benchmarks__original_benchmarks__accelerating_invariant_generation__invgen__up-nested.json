Since `n` contains garbage value, we cannot say anything about the second loop invariant. However, since the loop condition is `j <= n`, we can assume that `n` is greater than or equal to `j`. Therefore, the second loop invariant is also true. `i` is explicitly initialized to `0`, so the third loop invariant is true.\n- In every iteration of the loop, `j` is incremented by `1`, so the first and second loop invariants still hold true. `i` doesn't change in the loop body, so the third loop invariant is still true.\n- After the loop termination, the loop condition `j <= n` is false. Therefore, `j` must be greater than `n`. Since the second loop invariant states that `j` is less than or equal to `n`, we can conclude that `n` must be less than or equal to `j`. Therefore, the second loop invariant is still true. Since `i` doesn't change in the loop body, the third loop invariant is still true. \n\nNow, let's use these loop invariants to verify the post-condition:\n```\n//@ assert( i>= 0);\n```\nThe assertion is not guarded by any condition, so we can directly use the loop invariants to verify it. Since the third loop invariant states that `i` is always equal to `0` in the loop body and the loop doesn't modify `i`, we can conclude that `i` is greater than or equal to `0` after the loop termination. Therefore, the post-condition is true.\n\nFinally, let's add a conjunction to bound the maximum and minimum values that `n` can take:\n```\n#define INT_MAX 2147483647\n#define INT_MIN (-INT_MAX - 1)\n\nvoid main() {\n  int n,j,i,k;\n\n  i = 0;\n  k = 0;\n\n  assume ( j<=n );\n  /*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= j;\n    loop invariant j <= n;\n    loop invariant i == 0;\n  */\n  while ( j <= n ) {\n    \n    assume( i >= 0);\n    \n    j++;\n  }\n  /*@ \n    assert i >= 0;\n  */\n}\n```\nWe can use the `INT_MAX` and `INT_MIN` macros defined in the program to bound the maximum and minimum values of `n` respectively:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= j;\n    loop invariant j <= n <= INT_MAX;\n    loop invariant i == 0;\n*/\n``` \n\nTherefore, the final program with all the necessary loop invariants is:\n```\n#define INT_MAX 2147483647\n#define INT_MIN (-INT_MAX - 1)\n\nint NONDET;\n\nvoid main() {\n  int n,j,i,k;\n\n  i = 0;\n  k = 0;\n\n  assume ( j<=n );\n  /*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= j;\n    loop invariant j <= n <= INT_MAX;\n    loop invariant i == 0;\n  */\n  while ( j <= n ) {\n    \n    assume( i >= 0);\n    \n    j++;\n  }\n  /*@ \n    assert i >= 0;\n  */\n}\n```"

Therefore, the first loop invariant is `0 <= j <= n+1`.\n- The variable `i` is not modified inside the loop. Since `i` is initialized to `0`, it will always be greater than or equal to `0`.
