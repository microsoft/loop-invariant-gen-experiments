Hence, y is bounded below by 100*(x-1). Also, since x starts at 0 and can be incremented up to 5, we add 0 <= x <= 5.\n\nLet's consider the second case where `unknown3()` returns true:\n- In this case, x may or may not be incremented, and y may or may not be incremented or negated.\n- To ensure that x < 4 || y > 2, we can add the following loop invariant before and after the loop:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant -5 <= y <= 5 && -1 <= x <= 5;\n*/\n```\n- Explanation: Since we cannot determine the behavior of the loop in this case, we can add a weaker invariant that bounds x and y.

The post-condition is: x < 4 || y > 2.\n\nLet's start by finding a loop invariant that holds true before the loop execution. Since x and y are initialized to 0, we can add the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0 && y >= 0;\n    loop invariant x <= 0 && y <= 0 ==> x == 0 && y == 0;\n*/\n```\nThe first invariant ensures that x and y are both non-negative before the loop execution, while the second invariant ensures that if x and y are both negative, then their values must be 0.\n\nNext, we need to find a loop invariant that holds true in every iteration of the loop. We can use the implication (==>) to take care of the conditional nature of the code. We also need to consider the relation between x and y that is induced by the code. Let's start with the following loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= x <= 5 && y >= 0 && (x < 4 || y > 2);\n*/\n```\nThis invariant ensures that x is between 0 and 5 (inclusive) and y is non-negative in every iteration of the loop. It also implies the post-condition. However, we need to consider the relation between x and y that is induced by the code. Specifically, if unknown2() is true, then x is incremented by 1 and y is incremented by 100, which means that y is always at least 100 times greater than x. Therefore, we can add the following conjunction to the loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= x <= 5 && y >= 100*x && (x < 4 || y > 2);\n*/\n```\nThis invariant ensures that y is always at least 100 times greater than x, in addition to the other constraints.\n\nFinally, we need to find a loop invariant that holds true after the loop termination. We can use the guard condition of the assertion in an implication to ensure that the assertion is only checked when the condition holds. We also need to consider the relation between x and y that is induced by the code. We can use the same loop invariant that we found for the loop body, since it already implies the post-condition. However, we need to add an implication to take care of the guard condition of the assertion:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= x <= 5 && y >= 100*x && (x < 4 || y > 2);\n    loop invariant !(unknown1()) ==> (x < 4 || y > 2);\n*/\n```\nThis invariant ensures that if the loop termination condition is false, then the post-condition holds.\n\nPutting it all together, we get the following code block containing the loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0 && y >= 0;\n    loop invariant x <= 0 && y <= 0 ==> x == 0 && y == 0;\n    loop invariant 0 <= x <= 5 && y >= 100*x && (x < 4 || y > 2);\n    loop invariant !(unknown1()) ==> (x < 4 || y > 2);\n*/\n```"

And `x` is assigned the value of 0 explicitly.\n- In every iteration of the loop:\n    - `(unknown1() == 0) ==> (x < 4 || y > 2)`: This implication ensures that the assertion holds after the loop termination. If the loop condition fails i.e., `unknown1()` returns 0, then the assertion holds trivially. Otherwise, `x` can keep incrementing till it reaches 4, and `y` can keep incrementing in multiples of 100. So, the assertion holds true in that case as well. \n    - `x >= 0 && y >= 0`: This conjunction bounds the lower limits of `x` and `y`. Since `x` and `y` are always incremented by a positive value, they can never become negative. Hence, `x >= 0` and `y >= 0`.\n    - `x >= 0 && y <= x*100`: This conjunction bounds the maximum value of `y` based on the value of `x`. Since `y` is incremented by 100 every time `x` is incremented, `y` can never be greater than `x*100`. Hence, `y <= x*100`.\n    - `x >= 0 && y <= x+1`: This conjunction bounds the maximum value of `y` based on the value of `x`. If `unknown2()` returns false, then `y` is not incremented by 100. In that case, `y` can be at most equal to `x+1`. Hence, `y <= x+1`.\n- After the loop termination:\n    - `x >= 0`: This conjunction bounds the lower limit of `x` after the loop termination. Since `x` is incremented by a positive value in every iteration of the loop, it can never become negative. Hence, `x >= 0`.\n    - `x < 4 || y > 2`: This disjunction ensures that the assertion holds after the loop termination. If `x` is less than 4, then the assertion holds trivially. Otherwise, `y` must be greater than 2 for the assertion to hold, which is ensured by the loop invariant `(unknown1() == 0) ==> (x < 4 || y > 2)`."

Since `y` is incremented by 1, it must be greater than 2. We use the `\\at()` notation to refer to the value of `x` and `y` at the beginning of the loop, which is the previous iteration's value. This ensures that the invariant holds for every iteration of the loop.\n- `(x < 4 && y == \\at(y, Pre) + 100*\\at(x, Pre)) ==> (y > 2)` - This invariant checks that if `x` is less than 4, then `y` is incremented by 100.

Hence, `y <= x*100`.\n    - `x >= 0 && y <= x+1`: This conjunction bounds the maximum value of `y` based on the value of `x`. If `unknown2()` returns false, then `y` is not incremented by 100.
