Also, since `n` is greater than 0, we have `x <= n`. Thus, `0 <= x <= n`.\n- In every iteration: Since the loop increments `x` by 1 in every iteration, we have `1 <= x`. Also, `x` is always less than `n` in the loop condition, so we have `x <= n`. Thus, `1 <= x <= n`.\n- After the loop: The loop terminates when `x` becomes equal to `n` or greater than `n`. Since the loop condition is `x < n`, `x` cannot become greater than `n`. Thus, `x <= n`.\n\nWe can combine these loop invariants in one block, as follows:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= x <= n;\n    loop invariant 1 <= x <= n;\n    loop invariant x <= n;\n*/\n```\n\nNote that we don't need to add any implications or additional constraints, as the loop invariants themselves imply the post-condition."

This gives us `1 <= x <= n ==> x <= n`.\n\nPutting everything together, the loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= x <= n;\n    loop invariant 1 <= x <= n;\n    loop invariant x >= n;\n    loop invariant 1 <= x <= n ==> x <= n;\n*/\n```"

The loop condition checks if `x` is less than `n`.\n\nNow, let's output the necessary loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0 && x <= n+1;\n    loop invariant n > 0;\n    loop invariant x <= n+1;\n    loop invariant x >= 1 ==> x <= n+1;\n    loop invariant x <= n ==> x < n;\n    loop invariant x > n ==> x == n+1;\n*/\n```\n\n- The first loop invariant specifies that `x` is always non-negative and less than or equal to `n+1`. The `n+1` bound is because the loop condition is `x < n` and the last value of `x` in the loop is `n`. \n- The second loop invariant specifies that `n` is always greater than `0`, which is assumed before the loop.\n- The third loop invariant specifies that `x` is always less than or equal to `n+1`.\n- The fourth loop invariant specifies that if `x` is greater than or equal to `1`, then it is less than or equal to `n+1`. This is because `x` is initialized to `0` and incremented by `1` in each iteration.\n- The fifth loop invariant specifies that if `x` is less than or equal to `n`, then it is strictly less than `n`. This follows from the loop condition `x < n`.\n- The sixth loop invariant specifies that if `x` is greater than `n`, then it must be equal to `n+1`. This follows from the loop condition `x < n`.\n\nFinally, let's use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code in the assertion:\n```\n{;\n//@ assert (n <= 0) || (x<=n);\n}\n```\nThe assertion is guarded by the condition `n > 0` which means that if `n` is less than or equal to `0`, the assertion is trivially true. Therefore, we can use implication to make the assertion true for all values of `n`:\n```\n{;\n//@ assert n <= 0 || (n > 0 && x<=n);\n}\n```\n\nPutting it all together, we get the following program with the necessary loop invariants:\n```\n#define assume(e) if(!(e)) return;\nextern int unknown(void);\n\nvoid main() {\n  int x=0;\n  int n = unknown();\n\n  assume(n > 0);\n  /*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0 && x <= n+1;\n    loop invariant n > 0;\n    loop invariant x <= n+1;\n    loop invariant x >= 1 ==> x <= n+1;\n    loop invariant x <= n ==> x < n;\n    loop invariant x > n ==> x == n+1;\n  */\n  while( x < n ){\n    x++;\n  }\n  {;\n    //@ assert n <= 0 || (n > 0 && x<=n);\n  }\n}\n```"
