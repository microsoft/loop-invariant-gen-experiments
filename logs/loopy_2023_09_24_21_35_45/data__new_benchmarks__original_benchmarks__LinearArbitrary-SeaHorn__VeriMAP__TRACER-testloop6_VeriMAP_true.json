On the other hand, if NONDET is greater than 0, then the if part is executed, which means that x is not necessarily incremented. Hence, in this case, x should be greater than or equal to i - 1.

We also know that x, z, and y should be greater than or equal to 0. The expression (NONDET <= 0 ==> x >= i) implies that if NONDET is less than or equal to 0, then x should be greater than or equal to i. This is because if NONDET is less than or equal to 0, then the else part of the if statement is executed, which increments the value of x. On the other hand, if NONDET is greater than 0, then the if part is executed, which means that x is not necessarily incremented. Hence, in this case, x should be greater than or equal to i - 1. The expression (y < 0 ==> errorFn()) implies that if y is less than 0, then the error function is called. Note that this assertion is guarded by the condition in the if statement, which means that it is only checked when NONDET is greater than 0.\n- After the loop termination, we know that x and z should be greater than or equal to 0.\n\nNote: Since NONDET is non-deterministic, we cannot make any assumptions about its value.
