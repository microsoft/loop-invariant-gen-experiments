The loop condition is `i<=SIZE`.\n\nNow, let's find the necessary loop invariants to help Frama-C verify the post-condition. We need to find loop invariants that are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination, such that the loop invariants imply the post-condition.\n\nLoop Invariants:\n- Before loop execution:\n    - None\n\n- In every iteration of the loop:\n    - `1 <= i <= SIZE+1`\n    - `sn = (i-1)/4 * a`\n    \n    Explanation: \n    - The first invariant ensures that i is always between 1 and SIZE+1, inclusive. This is because the loop condition is `i<=SIZE`, so `i` can take the value `SIZE+1` when the loop terminates. \n    - The second invariant ensures that `sn` is always a multiple of `a`, and the multiple depends on the value of `i`. When `i` is less than or equal to 3, the expression `(i-1)/4` evaluates to 0, so `sn` remains unchanged. When `i` is between 4 and 7 inclusive, the expression `(i-1)/4` evaluates to 1, so `sn` is incremented by `a`. When `i` is greater than 7, the expression `(i-1)/4` evaluates to 2, so `sn` is incremented by `2a`. \n\n- After loop termination:\n    - `sn = (SIZE/4)*a || sn = 0`\n\n    Explanation: \n    - Since `sn` is incremented by `a` every time `i` is between 4 and 7 inclusive, and since `SIZE` is 8, `sn` will be a multiple of `a` if and only if `i` has been between 4 and 7 inclusive exactly twice (i.e., `(SIZE-1)/4` times). Therefore, `sn` is equal to `(SIZE/4)*a` or 0. This implies the post-condition. \n\nPutting everything together, we get the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 1 <= i <= SIZE+1;\n    loop invariant sn == (i-1)/4 * a;\n    loop invariant sn == (SIZE/4)*a || sn == 0;\n*/\n```"

The loop body contains an `if` statement that increments the value of `sn` if the loop counter `i` is less than 4. This means that `sn` will be incremented by `a` (which is 2) only for the first 3 iterations of the loop. For the remaining iterations, `sn` will remain the same.\n\nTherefore, the necessary loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 1 <= i <= SIZE+1;\n    loop invariant sn == a*(i-1) || sn == a*(i-4);\n*/\n```\nExplanation:\n- The first loop invariant `1 <= i <= SIZE+1` holds before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. This bounds the value of the loop counter `i` between 1 and `SIZE+1` inclusive.\n- The second loop invariant `sn == a*(i-1) || sn == a*(i-4)` holds before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. This states that the value of `sn` is either equal to `a*(i-1)` or `a*(i-4)`. \n    - Before the loop execution, since `i` is 1, `sn` is equal to 0, which satisfies the second loop invariant.\n    - In every iteration of the loop, if `i` is less than or equal to 3, then `sn` is incremented by `a` and becomes equal to `a*(i-1)`. Otherwise, `sn` remains the same and is equal to `a*(i-4)`. Therefore, the second loop invariant is satisfied in every iteration of the loop.\n    - After the loop termination, the value of `i` is `SIZE+1`, which means that `sn` is either equal to `a*SIZE` or `a*(SIZE-3)`. This satisfies the post-condition `sn==SIZE*a || sn == 0` by implication."

Hence, `1 <= i <= SIZE+1`.\n  - The value of `sn` is incremented by `a` only if `i` is less than 4. Therefore, the value of `sn` is `a` for `i=1`, `2a` for `i=2`, `3a` for `i=3`, and then remains at `3a` for all subsequent iterations. The formula `sn = (i-1)/4*a` captures this relationship between `sn` and `i`.\n- After the loop termination:\n  - If `sn` is `SIZE*a`, then `i` must be `SIZE+1` because `sn` is incremented by `a` for each iteration where `i` is less than 4, and there are `SIZE/3` such iterations. Hence, `sn = SIZE/3 * a = SIZE*a` implies `i = SIZE+1`.\n  - If `sn` is 0, then `i` must be 1 because `sn` is never decremented and is incremented by `2a` at most `SIZE/3` times.
