Hence, `x + y <= 50` is a loop invariant that holds before loop execution. Also, if `x` is negative before loop execution, then `x + y` is definitely less than or equal to 0, and hence `x < 0 ==> x + y <= 50` is another loop invariant that holds before loop execution. Since `y` is incremented by 1 in every iteration of the loop, `y` is always greater than or equal to 0, and hence `y >= 0` is a loop invariant that holds before loop execution. \n- In every iteration of the loop, `x` is incremented by `y`, and hence `x + y` is always less than or equal to the maximum value of `x + y` from the previous iteration. Therefore, `x + y <= 50` is a loop invariant that holds in every iteration of the loop. Also, since `y` is incremented by 1 in every iteration of the loop, `y` is always greater than or equal to 1, and hence `y >= 1` is a loop invariant that holds in every iteration of the loop.\n- After the loop termination, if `x` is non-negative, then the loop did not execute at all, and hence `y` is greater than 0.

Since `y` is incremented in each iteration, it must be greater than zero after the loop terminates.\n- `x <= -50` for every iteration of the loop: This is a loop invariant that ensures that `x` is negative or zero in each iteration of the loop.\n- `y > 0` for every iteration of the loop: This is a loop invariant that ensures that `y` is non-negative in each iteration of the loop.\n- `y <= \\max(0, -x)` for every iteration of the loop: This loop invariant ensures that `y` does not exceed the absolute value of `x`. Since `x` is negative or zero in each iteration, `y` cannot be positive. Therefore, `y` is bounded by `0` and `-x`.\n- `x + y * \\max(1, y) <= 0` for every iteration of the loop: This loop invariant ensures that `x` and `y` satisfy the equation `x + y * i <= 0` for some integer value of `i`. This equation is true for all values of `i` greater than or equal to `y`. Therefore, we choose `i` to be the maximum of `1` and `y`. This loop invariant is equivalent to:\n  ```\n  (y == 0) ==> (x <= 0)\n  (y > 0) ==> (x + y <= 0)\n  ```\n  The first implication is true when `y` is zero because the equation becomes `x <= 0`, which is true since `x` is negative or zero. The second implication is true for all positive values of `y` because the equation becomes `x + y <= 0`, which is true since `x` is negative or zero and `y` is positive.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x <= -50;\n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n    loop invariant y > 0 ==> (y > 0) ==> \\max(0, -x) >= y;\n    loop invariant y > 0 ==> (y > 0) ==> x + y * \\max(1, y) <= 0;\n    loop invariant x + y * \\max(1, y) <= 0;\n    loop invariant (x < 0 && y == \\at(y, Pre)) ==> (x + y <= \\at(x + y, Pre));\n    loop invariant (y <= 0 && x == \\at(x, Pre)) ==> (x <= \\at(x, Pre));\n*/\n```\nNote that the last two loop invariants take care of the non-deterministic values of `x` and `y` at the beginning and end of the loop, respectively.
