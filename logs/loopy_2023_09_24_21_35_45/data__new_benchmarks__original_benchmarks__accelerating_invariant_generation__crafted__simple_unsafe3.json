Therefore, the difference between `N` and `x` is either zero or non-negative. If `N` is odd, then the difference between `N` and `x` is odd, and if `N` is even, then the difference is even. Hence, the difference is always odd or zero.\n- The post-condition is `x % 2`, which means that `x` is odd. Since `x` is always even according to the loop invariants, this condition can only be true if `x` is equal to `0` at the beginning of the loop. Therefore, we can add an implication to the post-condition that `x` is equal to `0` at the beginning of the loop. This can be expressed as `x == 0 ==> x % 2`. \n- Since `N` is uninitialized, we cannot make any assumptions about its value. Therefore, we need to add a conjunction to bound the maximum and minimum values that `N` can take. Since `N` is of type `unsigned short`, its minimum value is 0 and its maximum value is `USHRT_MAX`, which is a macro that defines the maximum value of an `unsigned short` integer. We can express these bounds as `0 <= N <= USHRT_MAX`.\n- Since `x` is always even, we can add a conjunction to bound its maximum and minimum values. The minimum value of `x` is 0, and the maximum value of `x` is `UINT_MAX - 1`, which is the largest even number that can be represented by an `unsigned int` integer. We can express these bounds as `0 <= x <= UINT_MAX - 1`.\n- The difference between `N` and `x` is always non-negative, which means that `N` is always greater than or equal to `x`. Therefore, we can add a conjunction to express this relation as `x <= N`.\n- Since `N` is uninitialized, we cannot make any assumptions about its value after the loop termination. Therefore, we need to add an implication to make the loop invariant trivially true at that location. This can be expressed as `x >= N ==> x % 2`. This implication is always true because `x % 2` is always false when `x >= N`. \n\nPutting it all together:\n```\n#define assume(e) if(!(e)) return 0;\n\nint main(void) {\n  unsigned int x = 0;\n  unsigned short N;\n\n  //@ assert 0 <= N <= USHRT_MAX;\n  //@ assert 0 <= x <= UINT_MAX - 1;\n  //@ assert x <= N;\n\n  while (x < N) {\n    x += 2;\n    //@ assert 0 <= x <= UINT_MAX - 1;\n    //@ assert x % 2 == 0;\n    //@ assert N >= x;\n  }\n\n  {;\n    //@ assert x == N || x == N + 1;\n    assume(x == 0 ==> x % 2);\n    assume(x >= N ==> x % 2);\n  }\n}\n``` \n\nNote that the final assertion `x == N || x == N + 1` is not a loop invariant, but rather a consequence of the loop termination condition."
