So, we can add the following invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x <= 100;\n    loop invariant y <= 101;\n*/\n```\n- After the loop termination, `x` should be equal to `100`, since that is the loop exit condition. Also, `y` should be equal to `x + 1`, since both `x` and `y` are incremented by 1 in each iteration. So, we have the invariant:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x == 100 ==> y == 101;\n*/\n```\n\nPutting it all together, the loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant y >= x + 1;\n    loop invariant x <= 100;\n    loop invariant y <= 101;\n    loop invariant x == 100 ==> y == 101;\n*/\n```\n\nNote: Since `x` is uninitialized and can have any garbage value, we cannot add any invariants that bound the minimum or maximum values of `x`."
