The second loop invariant ensures that x is greater than or equal to y after every iteration of the loop.\n\nSince the loop condition is x < y, we can use an implication to make the loop invariants trivially true at the beginning of the loop:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x <= y + 99;\n    loop invariant x >= y;\n    loop invariant x >= y ==> x <= y + 99;\n*/\n```\n\nFinally, since both x and y are assigned the value of unknown_int(), we cannot make any assumptions about their initial values.

If `x` is not less than `y`, the program terminates. \n\nStep 2: Loop condition\n```\nwhile (x<y) {\n  x=x+100;\n}\n```\nThe loop executes as long as `x` is less than `y`. In each iteration, `x` is incremented by 100. \n\nStep 3: Post-condition\n```\n//@ assert(x >= y && x <= y + 99);\n```\nThe program asserts that after the loop terminates, `x` is greater than or equal to `y` and less than or equal to `y+99`. \n\nStep 4: Loop invariants\n(i) Before the loop execution:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x < y ==> y - x >= 100;\n*/\n```\nThis invariant states that if `x` is less than `y`, then the difference between `y` and `x` is greater than or equal to 100. This is true because in each iteration of the loop, `x` is incremented by 100, so the difference between `y` and `x` increases by 100.\n\n(ii) In every iteration of the loop:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x < y ==> y - x >= 100;\n*/\n```\nThis is the same invariant as before. It holds in every iteration of the loop because the loop body only modifies `x` and does not affect the relation between `x` and `y`.\n\n(iii) After the loop termination:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= y || x == y - 100;\n    loop invariant x >= y && x <= y + 99 ==> x >= y && x <= y + 99;\n*/\n```\nThe first invariant states that either `x` is greater than or equal to `y` after the loop terminates or `x` is equal to `y-100`. This is true because in each iteration of the loop, `x` is incremented by 100, so `x` can only be equal to `y-100` if `x` was less than `y` before the loop started.\n\nThe second invariant is the same as the post-condition, but it is written as a loop invariant with a guard condition. It is true because the loop condition `x<y` implies that `x` is less than `y`, so the guard condition `x>=y && x<=y+99` is equivalent to `x==y` or `x==y+1` or ... or `x==y+99`. Therefore, the implication `x>=y && x<=y+99 ==> x>=y && x<=y+99` is always true. \n\nNote: We do not need to add any bounds on the variables `x` and `y` because they are non-deterministic and we cannot make any assumptions about their values."
