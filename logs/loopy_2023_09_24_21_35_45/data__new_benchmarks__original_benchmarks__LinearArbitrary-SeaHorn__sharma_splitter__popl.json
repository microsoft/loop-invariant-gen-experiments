Given a program, you can find loop invariants, which can then be used to verify some property in the program. \nFrama-C is a software verification tool for C programs. The input to Frama-C is a C program file with ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations.\nFor the given program, find the necessary loop invariants of the while loop to help Frama-C verify the post-condition.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. \n- Output loop invariants that are true \n(i) before the loop execution, \n(ii) in every iteration of the loop and \n(iii) after the loop termination, \nsuch that the loop invariants imply the post condition.\n- If a loop invariant is a conjunction, split it into its parts.\n- Output all the loop invariants in one code block. For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values. Do not use variables that have garbage values.**\n- **Do not use keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops.**\n- **Variables that are not explicitly initialized, could have garbage values. Do not make any assumptions about such values.**\n- **Do not use the \\at(x, Pre) notation for any variable x.**\n- **Do not use non-deterministic function calls.**\n"

Therefore, `x` is less than or equal to 100.\n    - `y` is initialized to 50, so it is greater than or equal to 50. `y` can never be less than 50 because the only way `y` can decrease is if `x` is greater than 50, which would increase `y` by 1. Therefore, `y` is greater than or equal to 50. Since `y` can only increase and the maximum value of `x` is 100, the maximum value of `y` is 100.\n- In every iteration of the loop:\n    - Since `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, it is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 100.\n    - If `x` is less than or equal to 50, then `y` never changes and remains 50. Therefore, `(x <= 50) ==> (y == 50)`.\n    - If `x` is greater than 50, then `y` is incremented by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, `y` is greater than or equal to `x`. Hence, `(x > 50) ==> (y >= x)`.\n- After the loop termination:\n    - The loop terminates when `x` becomes 100. Therefore, `x` is equal to 100.\n    - When `x` is greater than 50, `y` is incremented by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, `y` is equal to 100 when `x` is equal to 100.",

This is because, when x is less than or equal to 50, the conditional statement inside the loop is not executed, and y remains 50. \n- The fourth invariant states that if x is greater than 50, then y is equal to x. This is because, when x is greater than 50, the conditional statement inside the loop is executed, and y is incremented by 1 with each iteration, making it equal to x by the end of the loop.\n- The assertion `y == 100` is guarded by the condition that the loop has terminated, so we can write it as `x >= 100 ==> y == 100`.\n- Since x and y are explicitly initialized in the program, we do not need to use any implications to handle non-deterministic values.",
