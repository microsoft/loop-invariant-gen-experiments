No additional loop invariants are required at this point.\n- In every iteration of the loop, the value of i is incremented by 2, while the value of j is decremented by 1. Therefore, the difference between i and j is reduced by 1 in every iteration. This implies that i will eventually become greater than j, at which point the loop will terminate. Thus, we can add the loop invariant i <= j + 1 to ensure that i never exceeds j by more than 1.\n- The loop condition is j >= i. Since i starts at 1 and j starts at 10, this condition is initially true. In every iteration, the loop invariant i <= j + 1 ensures that this condition remains true. Therefore, we do not need to add any additional loop invariants for the loop condition.\n- The post-condition is j == 6. Since the loop only terminates when j is less than i, and i is incremented by 2 in every iteration, we can deduce that the final value of i is 11. Therefore, the only possible value for j that satisfies the post-condition is 6.

In each iteration of the loop, `i` is incremented by 2 and `j` is decremented by 1. The loop continues as long as `j` is greater than or equal to `i`. The loop terminates when `j` becomes less than `i`. \n\nBefore the loop execution:\n- `i == 1`\n- `j == 10`\n\nWe can add the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i % 2 == 1;\n    loop invariant j >= i;\n*/\n```\nThe first invariant ensures that `i` is always odd before the loop execution. The second invariant ensures that `j` is always greater than or equal to `i` before the loop execution.\n\nIn every iteration of the loop:\n- `i` is incremented by 2\n- `j` is decremented by 1\n\nWe can add the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i % 2 == 1;\n    loop invariant j >= i;\n    loop invariant (j + i) % 2 == 1;\n    loop invariant (j - i) >= -9;\n*/\n```\nThe first two invariants are the same as the ones before the loop execution. The third invariant ensures that the sum of `i` and `j` is always odd in every iteration of the loop. The fourth invariant ensures that the difference between `j` and `i` is always greater than or equal to `-9` in every iteration of the loop.\n\nAfter the loop termination:\n- `j < i`\n\nWe can add the following loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i % 2 == 1;\n    loop invariant j >= i || j < i;\n    loop invariant (j + i) % 2 == 1;\n    loop invariant (j - i) >= -9;\n    loop invariant j == i - 1 || j == i - 2;\n*/\n```\nThe first four invariants are the same as the ones in every iteration of the loop. The fifth invariant ensures that `j` is either equal to `i - 1` or `i - 2` after the loop termination. This is because `i` is incremented by 2 in every iteration of the loop and `j` is decremented by 1 in every iteration of the loop. Therefore, `j` must be equal to `i - 1` or `i - 2` after the loop termination.\n\nNow, we can use these loop invariants to prove the post-condition. The final assertion `j == 6` is guarded by the condition that `j` is either equal to `i - 1` or `i - 2`. Therefore, we can use this condition in an implication to prove the assertion:\n```\n{;\n    //@ assert (j >= i || j < i) ==> j == 6;\n}\n```\nThis assertion will be true because `j` is equal to `i - 1` when `i` is equal to 4, which satisfies the condition `j >= i || j < i`. Therefore, the loop invariants imply the post condition."
