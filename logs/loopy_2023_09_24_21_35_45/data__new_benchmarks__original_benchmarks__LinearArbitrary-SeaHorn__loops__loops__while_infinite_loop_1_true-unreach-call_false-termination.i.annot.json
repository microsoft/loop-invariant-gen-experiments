Since the loop runs infinitely and there is no code that modifies `x` inside the loop, we can use implication to show that `x != 0` holds after the loop termination:\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant x == 0;\n  loop assigns x; \n  loop variant 0;\n*/\nwhile(1)\n{\n  {;\n    //@ assert x == 0;\n  }\n} \n\n{//@ assert x == 0 ==> x != 0;}\n```\nNote that we also need to add the loop assigns clause to specify which variables are modified inside the loop. Since `x` is not modified inside the loop, we can simply use `loop assigns x;`. We also need to add a loop variant to show that the loop will eventually terminate. Since the loop runs infinitely, we can use `loop variant 0;` to indicate that the loop variant does not decrease."

This is because `x` is not modified inside the loop, and it is initialized to 0 before the loop. Therefore, it will always be equal to 0 inside the loop.\n- After the loop termination, the loop invariant is `x != 0`. This is because the loop has an infinite condition, so it will never terminate unless there is a `return` statement inside the loop. Since there is a `return` statement inside the loop, the loop will terminate, and the only possible value for `x` at the end of the loop is 0. Therefore, the loop invariant `x != 0` holds after the loop termination. \n\nStep 5: Loop invariants in ACSL notation\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x == 0;\n*/\n```"
