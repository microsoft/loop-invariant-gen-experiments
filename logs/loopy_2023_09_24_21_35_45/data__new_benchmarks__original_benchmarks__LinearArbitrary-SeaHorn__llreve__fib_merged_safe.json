We will start with the post-condition and work backwards to find the loop invariants.\n\nPost-condition: `h2 == h1 + f1`\n\nWe can use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the program. So, we can rewrite the post-condition as:\n\n`(n <= 0) ==> (h2 == h1 + f1)`\n\nLoop invariant 1: `f2 == fib(i)`\n\nSince `f2` is initialized to `1` and updated in each iteration of the loop as `f2 = g2`, we can infer that `f2` represents the `i+1`th Fibonacci number, where `i` is the number of times the loop has executed. Therefore, the loop invariant `f2 == fib(i)` is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop and after the loop termination. Here, `fib(i)` denotes the `i`th Fibonacci number.\n\nLoop invariant 2: `f1 == fib(i-1)`\n\nSince `f1` is initialized to `0` and updated in each iteration of the loop as `f1 = g1`, we can infer that `f1` represents the `i`th Fibonacci number, where `i` is the number of times the loop has executed. Therefore, the loop invariant `f1 == fib(i-1)` is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop and after the loop termination.\n\nLoop invariant 3: `g2 == fib(i-1) + fib(i)`\n\nSince `g2` is initialized to `1` and updated in each iteration of the loop as `g2 = h2`, we can infer that `g2` represents the `i+2`th Fibonacci number, where `i` is the number of times the loop has executed. Therefore, the loop invariant `g2 == fib(i-1) + fib(i)` is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop and after the loop termination.\n\nLoop invariant 4: `g1 == fib(i) + fib(i-1)`\n\nSince `g1` is initialized to `1` and updated in each iteration of the loop as `g1 = h1`, we can infer that `g1` represents the `i+1`th Fibonacci number, where `i` is the number of times the loop has executed. Therefore, the loop invariant `g1 == fib(i) + fib(i-1)` is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop and after the loop termination.\n\nLoop invariant 5: `h2 == fib(i+1) + fib(i)`\n\nSince `h2` is updated in each iteration of the loop as `h2 = f2 + g2`, we can infer that `h2` represents the `i+3`th Fibonacci number, where `i` is the number of times the loop has executed. Therefore, the loop invariant `h2 == fib(i+1) + fib(i)` is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop and after the loop termination.\n\nLoop invariant 6: `h1 == fib(i) + fib(i-1)`\n\nSince `h1` is updated in each iteration of the loop as `h1 = f1 + g1`, we can infer that `h1` represents the `i+1`th Fibonacci number, where `i` is the number of times the loop has executed. Therefore, the loop invariant `h1 == fib(i) + fib(i-1)` is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop and after the loop termination.\n\nLoop invariant 7: `n >= 0`\n\nSince the loop condition is `(n > 0)`, the loop can only be executed if `n >= 1` at the beginning of each"

We will start with the post-condition and work backwards to find the loop invariants.\n\nPost-condition: `h2 == h1 + f1`\n\nWe can use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the program. So, we can rewrite the post-condition as:\n\n`(n <= 0) ==> (h2 == h1 + f1)`\n\nLoop invariant 1: `f2 == fib(i)`\n\nSince `f2` is initialized to `1` and updated in each iteration of the loop as `f2 = g2`, we can infer that `f2` represents the `i+1`th Fibonacci number, where `i` is the number of times the loop has executed. Therefore, the loop invariant `f2 == fib(i)` is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop and after the loop termination. Here, `fib(i)` denotes the `i`th Fibonacci number.\n\nLoop invariant 2: `f1 == fib(i-1)`\n\nSince `f1` is initialized to `0` and updated in each iteration of the loop as `f1 = g1`, we can infer that `f1` represents the `i`th Fibonacci number, where `i` is the number of times the loop has executed. Therefore, the loop invariant `f1 == fib(i-1)` is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop and after the loop termination.\n\nLoop invariant 3: `g2 == fib(i-1) + fib(i)`\n\nSince `g2` is initialized to `1` and updated in each iteration of the loop as `g2 = h2`, we can infer that `g2` represents the `i+2`th Fibonacci number, where `i` is the number of times the loop has executed. Therefore, the loop invariant `g2 == fib(i-1) + fib(i)` is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop and after the loop termination.\n\nLoop invariant 4: `g1 == fib(i) + fib(i-1)`\n\nSince `g1` is initialized to `1` and updated in each iteration of the loop as `g1 = h1`, we can infer that `g1` represents the `i+1`th Fibonacci number, where `i` is the number of times the loop has executed. Therefore, the loop invariant `g1 == fib(i) + fib(i-1)` is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop and after the loop termination.\n\nLoop invariant 5: `h2 == fib(i+1) + fib(i)`\n\nSince `h2` is updated in each iteration of the loop as `h2 = f2 + g2`, we can infer that `h2` represents the `i+3`th Fibonacci number, where `i` is the number of times the loop has executed. Therefore, the loop invariant `h2 == fib(i+1) + fib(i)` is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop and after the loop termination.\n\nLoop invariant 6: `h1 == fib(i) + fib(i-1)`\n\nSince `h1` is updated in each iteration of the loop as `h1 = f1 + g1`, we can infer that `h1` represents the `i+1`th Fibonacci number, where `i` is the number of times the loop has executed. Therefore, the loop invariant `h1 == fib(i) + fib(i-1)` is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop and after the loop termination.\n\nLoop invariant 7: `n >= 0`\n\nSince the loop condition is `(n > 0)`, the loop can only be executed if `n >= 1` at the beginning of each",

Since `f1`, `f2`, `g1`, and `g2` are non-negative, we only need to ensure that their sum `f1 + g1` and `f2 + g2` does not exceed the maximum integer value. Hence the invariants `0 <= f1 <= h1 <= f1 + g1 <= \\max_int` and `1 <= f2 <= h2 <= f2 + g2 <= \\max_int`.\n- There are no non-deterministic values in the loop, so we do not need to use implications to handle them.\n- Finally, the assertion `h2 == h1 + f1` must hold at the end of each iteration of the loop.
