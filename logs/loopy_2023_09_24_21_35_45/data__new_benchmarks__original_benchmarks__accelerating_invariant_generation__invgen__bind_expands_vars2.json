Therefore, we can add the following loop invariant:\n\n```\n/*@ \nloop invariant 0 <= mc_i <= n2;\nloop invariant cp1_off <= MAXDATA * 2 - n2;\nloop invariant cp1_off <= MAXDATA * 2 - mc_i;\nloop invariant cp1_off + mc_i < MAXDATA * 2;\n*/\n```\n\nThe first loop invariant states that `mc_i` is always between 0 and `n2`. The second loop invariant states that `cp1_off` is always less than or equal to `MAXDATA * 2 - n2`. This is because `cp1_off` cannot be greater than `n1`, and `n1 + n2 <= MAXDATA * 2`. Therefore, `cp1_off` should be less than or equal to `MAXDATA * 2 - n2`. The third loop invariant states that `cp1_off` is always less than or equal to `MAXDATA * 2 - mc_i`. This is because `mc_i` increases in every iteration of the loop, so `cp1_off` should be less than or equal to `MAXDATA * 2 - mc_i` to satisfy the assertion. The fourth loop invariant states that `cp1_off + mc_i` is always less than `MAXDATA * 2`, which is the condition in the assertion.\n\nNow, let's consider the preconditions and variable assignments in the program:\n```\nint cp1_off, n1, n2, mc_i;\nint MAXDATA;\nif (MAXDATA > 0 ); else goto END;\n\nif ((n1 <= MAXDATA * 2)); else goto END;\n\nif ((cp1_off <= n1)); else goto END;\n\nif ((n2 <= MAXDATA*2 - n1)); else goto END;\n```\nThe variable `MAXDATA` is defined, but we don't have any information about its value. Therefore, we cannot add any loop invariant that involves `MAXDATA`. However, we can add loop invariants for the other variables:\n```\n/*@ \nloop invariant 0 <= mc_i <= n2;\nloop invariant 0 <= n1 <= MAXDATA * 2;\nloop invariant 0 <= n2 <= MAXDATA * 2 - n1;\nloop invariant 0 <= cp1_off <= n1;\nloop invariant cp1_off <= MAXDATA * 2 - n2;\nloop invariant cp1_off <= MAXDATA * 2 - mc_i;\nloop invariant cp1_off + mc_i < MAXDATA * 2;\n*/\n```\nThe loop invariants state that `n1` is always between 0 and `MAXDATA * 2`, `n2` is always between 0 and `MAXDATA * 2 - n1`, and `cp1_off` is always between 0 and `n1`. The other loop invariants are the same as before.\n\nFinally, we need to ensure that the loop invariants imply the post-condition:\n```\n//@ assert(cp1_off+mc_i < MAXDATA * 2);\n```\nSince we don't have any information about the value of `MAXDATA`, we cannot add any loop invariant that involves `MAXDATA`. Therefore, we cannot directly imply the post-condition using the loop invariants. However, the loop invariants ensure that the assertion inside the loop is always true. Therefore, if the loop terminates normally, the post-condition is true. We can add the following additional loop invariant to ensure normal termination of the loop:\n```\n/*@ \nloop invariant 0 <= mc_i <= n2;\nloop invariant 0 <= n1 <= MAXDATA * 2;\nloop invariant 0 <= n2 <= MAXDATA * 2 - n1;\nloop invariant 0 <= cp1_off <= n1;\nloop invariant cp1_off <= MAXDATA * 2 - n2;\nloop invariant cp1_off <= MAXDATA * 2 - mc_i;\nloop invariant cp1_off + mc_i < MAXDATA * 2;\nloop invariant mc_i == n2 ==> cp1_off+mc_i < MAXDATA * 2;\n*/\n```\nThe last loop invariant states that if `mc_i` is equal to `n2`, then the assertion inside the loop is true, which implies the post-condition. Therefore, the loop invariants imply the post-condition."
