            "ERROR: Output does not contain at least 1 code block\nOutput:\nPre-conditions:\n- The program has no pre-conditions except the ones defined in the program itself.\n- The program defines a macro `assume(e)` which returns 0 if the expression `e` is false. \n\nVariable Assignments:\n- `old` is assigned the value of the function `unknown_uint()`.\n- `lock` is initialized to 0.\n- `new` is assigned the value of `old+1`.\n\nLoop Condition:\n- The loop continues as long as `new` is not equal to `old`.\n\nLoop Invariants:\n- Before the loop execution:\n  - The value of `old` is non-negative. (old >= 0)\n  - The value of `new` is greater than `old`. (new == old+1)\n  - The value of `lock` is 0. (lock == 0)\n- In every iteration of the loop:\n  - The value of `old` remains non-negative. (old >= 0)\n  - The value of `new` remains greater than `old`. (new == old+1)\n  - The value of `lock` remains 1. (lock == 1)\n- After the loop termination:\n  - The value of `old` is non-negative. (old >= 0)\n  - The value of `new` is greater than or equal to `old`. (new >= old)\n  - The value of `lock` is 1. (lock == 1)\n\nExplanation:\n- Before the loop starts, we know that `old` is non-negative and `new` is one more than `old`. We also know that `lock` is 0, since it hasn't been modified yet.\n- In each iteration of the loop, `old` is updated to `new` which means that it remains non-negative and `new` is incremented by 1, which means that it remains greater than `old`. We also know that `lock` is 1 inside the loop body.\n- After the loop termination, we know that `new` is either equal to `old` or greater than `old`. We also know that `lock` is 1, since the loop terminates only when `lock` is 1.",
