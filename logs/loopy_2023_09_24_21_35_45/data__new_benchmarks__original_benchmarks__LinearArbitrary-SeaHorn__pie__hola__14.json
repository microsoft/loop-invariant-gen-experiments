The expression `(a+j) - \\at(a, Pre)` represents the change in the value of `a` from its previous value. Since the loop adds 1 to `a` whenever `unknown1()` returns a non-zero value, and subtracts 1 from `a` otherwise, the change in `a` can be at most 1. Hence, we have `(a+j) - \\at(a, Pre) >= -1` and `(a+j) - \\at(a, Pre) <= 1`. Also, `j` must lie between `1` and `m`.\n- After the loop terminates, `a` can have any value, but it must lie between `-m` and `m` (as per the post-condition).

Also, since the variable `m` is initialized to a non-negative value, we do not need any bounds on its value.

Also, since the loop starts with `j=1`, we have `j == 1`.\n- In every iteration of the loop, `a` can have any value as long as it lies between `-m` and `m`. The expression `(a+j) - \\at(a, Pre)` represents the change in the value of `a` from its previous value. Since the loop adds 1 to `a` whenever `unknown1()` returns a non-zero value, and subtracts 1 from `a` otherwise, the change in `a` can be at most 1. Hence, we have `(a+j) - \\at(a, Pre) >= -1` and `(a+j) - \\at(a, Pre) <= 1`. Also, `j` must lie between `1` and `m`.\n- After the loop terminates, `a` can have any value, but it must lie between `-m` and `m` (as per the post-condition). Also, since the loop terminates when `j > m`, we have `j == m+1`.\n\nNote that we did not need to use any assumptions about the functions `unknown()` and `unknown1()` since we do not know anything about their behavior. Also, since the variable `m` is initialized to a non-negative value, we do not need any bounds on its value. However, if we knew something about the function `unknown1()`, we could have used that information to derive tighter bounds on `a` and `j`.",

If `unknown1()` is true, then `a` increases by 1, and if `unknown1()` is false, then `a` decreases by 1. Therefore, if `a` is between `-j` and `j` in the current iteration, then `a+1` or `a-1` will also be between `-j` and `j` in the next iteration.\n- After `m` iterations, `a` can take any value between `-m` and `m`, since `a` can increase or decrease by 1 in each iteration and `j` can take any value between 1 and `m`.\n- Therefore, the loop invariants given above are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop and after the loop termination, and they imply the post-condition."
