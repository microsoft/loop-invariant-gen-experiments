This is because the loop condition is `i<=SIZE`, and we need to make sure that `i` does not go beyond `SIZE+1` in the loop body. Also, we need to make sure that `sn` is updated correctly in each iteration, i.e., `sn = (i-1)*a`.\n- After the loop termination, we need to make sure that `sn` has the correct value, i.e., `sn = SIZE*a`.\n\nPutting it all together:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 1 <= i <= SIZE+1;\n    loop invariant sn == (i-1)*a;\n    loop invariant sn == 0 ==> i == 1;\n    loop invariant sn == SIZE*a ==> i == SIZE+1;\n*/\n``` \n\nWe also added two implications for the case when `sn` is non-deterministic at the beginning or end of the loop.

This is true before the loop starts (since `i=1` and `sn=0`) and remains true throughout the loop as the loop body adds `a` to `sn` in each iteration.\n- The fourth loop invariant is an implication that says if `i` is equal to `SIZE+1` (i.e., the loop has terminated), then `sn` is either equal to `SIZE*a` or 0, which is the post-condition.

Therefore, `sn` is the only variable that changes in the loop.\n\nNext, let's analyze the loop condition. The loop condition is `i<=SIZE`. This means that the loop will execute SIZE times. Since `i` starts at 1 and increases by 1 in each iteration, we can conclude that `i` will take on the values 1, 2, ..., SIZE.\n\nNow, let's look at the post-condition. The post-condition is `sn==SIZE*a || sn == 0`. This means that either `sn` is equal to `SIZE*a` or it is equal to 0.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can derive the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 1 <= i <= SIZE+1;\n    loop invariant sn == (i-1)*a;\n    loop invariant sn <= SIZE*a;\n    loop invariant sn >= 0;\n    loop invariant (sn == 0) ==> (i == SIZE+1);\n    loop invariant (sn == SIZE*a) ==> (i == SIZE+1);\n*/\n```\n\nExplanation of loop invariants:\n- The first invariant ensures that `i` takes on values between 1 and SIZE+1, which is important to ensure that the loop executes SIZE times.\n- The second invariant states that `sn` is equal to `(i-1)*a`, which is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop and after the loop termination. This is because in each iteration, we add `a` to `sn`, and `i-1` gives the number of times we have added `a` so far.\n- The third invariant ensures that `sn` is always less than or equal to `SIZE*a`, which is important to ensure that the post-condition is satisfied.\n- The fourth invariant ensures that `sn` is always greater than or equal to 0, which is important to ensure that the post-condition is satisfied.\n- The fifth invariant states that if `sn` is equal to 0, then `i` must be equal to SIZE+1. This is because if `sn` is 0, then we have not executed the loop at all, and therefore `i` must be equal to SIZE+1 to satisfy the loop condition.\n- The sixth invariant states that if `sn` is equal to `SIZE*a`, then `i` must be equal to SIZE+1. This is because if `sn` is equal to `SIZE*a`, then we have executed the loop SIZE times, and therefore `i` must be equal to SIZE+1 to satisfy the loop condition."

This can be expressed as `1 <= i <= SIZE + 1`. \n- The variable `sn` is equal to the sum of the first `i-1` multiples of `a`.

Thus, in every iteration of the loop, we have `sn == (i-1)*a`.\n- After the loop terminates, `i` is greater than `SIZE`, so we have `i > SIZE ==> (sn == SIZE*a)`.

Also, `sn` is updated to add `a` to it in each iteration, which means that after `i` iterations, `sn` should be equal to `(i-1)*a`. Hence, the second loop invariant is `1 <= i <= SIZE+1 && sn == (i-1)*a`.\n- After the loop: When the loop terminates, `i` should have the value `SIZE+1`, and `sn` should be equal to `SIZE*a` since `sn` has `a` added to it `SIZE` times in the loop.
