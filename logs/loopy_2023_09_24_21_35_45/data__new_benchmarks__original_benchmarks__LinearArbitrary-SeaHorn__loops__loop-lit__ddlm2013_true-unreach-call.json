We can derive the formula for `b` as follows:\n    - Before the first iteration, `b` is equal to 0.\n    - In the first iteration, `b` is equal to `(j-i)`.\n    - In the second iteration, `b` is equal to `(j-i) + (j-i-1)`.\n    - In the third iteration, `b` is equal to `(j-i) + (j-i-1) + (j-i-2)`.\n    - And so on...\n    - Therefore, after `a` iterations, `b` is equal to `(j-1)*a + (a*(a-1)/2) - ((i-1)/2)*a`.\n- The third statement in the loop increments the value of `i` by 2, therefore `i` is always odd.\n- The fourth statement in the loop updates the value of `j`. If `i` is even, then `j` is incremented by 2, otherwise `j` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` is always even and is always greater than or equal to `i`.\n- Since `i` is always odd and is always greater than or equal to 1, it follows that `i` is always greater than or equal to 1.\n- Similarly, since `j` is always greater than or equal to `i`, it follows that `j` is always greater than or equal to 1.\n\nAfter the loop termination:\n- If `flag` is true, then the assertion `a == b` is checked. Since we have proved that `a` and `b` have the required relationship in every iteration of the loop, it follows that the assertion is true after the loop termination if `flag` is true.\n- If `flag` is false, then the assertion is not checked, so the loop invariants do not need to hold in this case.\n\nNote:\n- Since `flag` is non-deterministic, we cannot make any assumptions about the validity of the assertion if `flag` is false. Therefore, we only consider the case where `flag` is true. \n- Since `unknown_int()` and `unknown()` are non-deterministic functions, we cannot make any assumptions about their return values.
