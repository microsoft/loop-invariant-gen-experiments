The loop iterates over the variable `i` and increments it by `k` in each iteration until `i` reaches `LARGE_INT*k`. The program then asserts that `i` is indeed equal to `LARGE_INT*k`.\n\nTo verify this program using Frama-C, we need to find loop invariants that are true before the loop, in each iteration, and after the loop. These invariants should imply the program's post-condition that `i` is equal to `LARGE_INT*k`. \n\nLet's start by analyzing the program and making some observations:\n\n- The loop iterates over `i` with an increment of `k`, starting from `0` until `i` reaches `LARGE_INT*k`.\n- The program asserts that `i` is equal to `LARGE_INT*k` after the loop.\n\nFrom these observations, we can derive some possible loop invariants:\n\n- `0 <= i <= LARGE_INT*k` before the loop.\n- `i % k == 0` in each iteration, since `i` is incremented by `k` in each iteration.\n- `i <= LARGE_INT*k` in each iteration, since the loop condition is `i < LARGE_INT*k`.\n- `i == j*k` in each iteration, where `j` is an integer that starts from `0` and increases by `1` in each iteration. This is implied by the previous two invariants.\n- `i == LARGE_INT*k` after the loop, since this is what the program asserts.\n\nWe can combine these invariants into a single block as follows:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= i <= LARGE_INT*k;\n    loop invariant i % k == 0;\n    loop invariant i <= LARGE_INT*k;\n    loop invariant \\forall integer j; 0 <= j < i/k ==> i == j*k;\n*/\n```\nNote that we used the universal quantifier `\\forall` to express the relation between `i` and `j` in the last invariant.
