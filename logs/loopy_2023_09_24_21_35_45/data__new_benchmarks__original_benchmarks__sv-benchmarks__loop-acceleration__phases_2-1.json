This is true because `x` is multiplied by itself in each iteration of the loop.\n- `(\\forall unsigned int i; x < i && i <= y ==> i > x*x)` is true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop. It captures the behavior of the statement `x++;`. It states that for all `i` greater than `x` and less than or equal to `y`, `i` is greater than `x*x`. This is true because `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. \n\nNote:\n- We do not need to add any conjunction for the variables `x` and `y` to bound their maximum and minimum values, as there are no such bounds given in the program.\n- We do not need to add any conjunction for the relation between `x` and `y`, as there is no such relation given in the program.",
            "ERROR: Output does not contain at least 1 code block\nOutput:\nPre-conditions:\n- x is initialized to 1.\n- y is initialized to the result of an unknown function that returns an unsigned integer.\n\nLoop condition:\n- x < y\n\nLoop invariants:\n- x <= y\n- x > 0\n- y > 0\n- if x <= sqrt(y), then x is a perfect square.\n- if x > sqrt(y), then x <= y\n\nExplanation:\n- The first invariant ensures that x is always less than or equal to y, which is required by the loop condition.\n- The second and third invariants ensure that x and y are positive, which is required by the loop condition.\n- The fourth invariant is a conditional invariant that states that if x is less than or equal to the square root of y, then x is a perfect square. This is because in the loop body, if x is less than the square root of y, then we square x, which means that x becomes a perfect square. This invariant holds true because if x is a perfect square, then x = a^2 for some integer a, and since x <= sqrt(y), we have a^2 <= sqrt(y), which implies that a <= sqrt(sqrt(y)). Therefore, x is a perfect square.\n- The fifth invariant is also a conditional invariant that states that if x is greater than the square root of y, then x is less than or equal to y. This is because in the loop body, if x is greater than or equal to the square root of y, then we increment x by 1, which means that x becomes greater than or equal to y. This invariant holds true because if x is greater than the square root of y, then x > sqrt(y), which implies that x^2 > y. Therefore, x <= y.\n\nUsing these loop invariants, we can prove the post-condition that x is not equal to y. Here's how:\n\nPost-condition:\n- x != y\n\nProof:\n- From the loop invariants, we know that x <= y, so if x = y, then x and y both must be equal to 1.\n- However, the loop condition requires that x < y, so the loop body must have been executed at least once.\n- If the loop body has been executed at least once, then x cannot be equal to y, because either x was squared or incremented by 1, which means that it became strictly greater than y.\n- Therefore, the post-condition x != y holds.",
