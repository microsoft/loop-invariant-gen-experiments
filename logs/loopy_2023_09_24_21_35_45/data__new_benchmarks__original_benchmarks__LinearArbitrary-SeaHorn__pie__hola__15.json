We can express this as a conjunction `k >= 0 && ...`, where `...` represents any other necessary pre-conditions.\n\n2. Loop Invariants:\n- Since `j` starts at `0` and is incremented by `1` in each iteration of the loop, we have `0 <= j <= n`.\n- Since `k` starts at some value `k0` and is decremented by `1` in each iteration of the loop, we have `0 <= k <= k0`.\n- Combining the above two inequalities, we get `0 <= j <= n <= k0`.\n- Since the loop condition is `j < n`, we have `j < k0`.\n- Combining all the above inequalities, we have `0 <= j <= n < k0`.\n- Therefore, a suitable loop invariant is `0 <= j <= n < k0 && k >= 0`.\n\n3. Post-conditions:\n- After the loop terminates, we have `j == n` and `k >= 0`.\n- Therefore, a suitable post-condition is `j == n && k >= 0`.\n\nPutting everything together, we get the following loop invariants:\n```\n//@ loop invariant 0 <= j <= n < k0 && k >= 0;\n//@ loop invariant j < k0;\n//@ loop invariant 0 <= i <= n && 0 <= k <= k0;\n//@ loop invariant n > 0 ==> (j == n ==> k >= 0);\n//@ loop variant k;\nwhile( j < n ) {\n    j++;\n    k--;\n} \n```\nNote that we also added an additional loop invariant `0 <= i <= n && 0 <= k <= k0` that bounds the values of `i` and `k` since they are not used inside the loop. We also added an implication to take care of the conditional nature of the program. Finally, we added a loop variant `k` to ensure that the loop terminates."
