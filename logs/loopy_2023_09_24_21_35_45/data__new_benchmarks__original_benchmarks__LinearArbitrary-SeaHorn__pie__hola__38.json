The value of `n` is non-deterministic.\n\n**Step 2: Loop condition**\n\nThe while loop iterates while `i` is less than `n`.\n\n**Step 3: Loop invariants**\n\nWe need to find loop invariants that are true:\n\n(i) before the loop execution, \n(ii) in every iteration of the loop and \n(iii) after the loop termination, \nsuch that the loop invariants imply the post condition.\n\nLet's start with the post-condition:\n```\nx == 2*y\n```\nThis is the property that we want to verify.\n\nNow, let's think about some properties that hold before and after the loop. Since `x` and `y` are initialized to 0, we can add the following loop invariants before the loop:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n*/\n```\n\nIn every iteration of the loop, `i` is incremented by 1. We can add the following loop invariant to capture this:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i >= 0;\n*/\n```\n\nSince the loop iterates while `i` is less than `n`, we can add the following loop invariant to capture this:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i <= n;\n*/\n```\n\nNow, let's try to find a loop invariant that relates `x` and `y`. \n\nWhen `i` is even, `y` is incremented. So, we can say that the number of even values of `i` is equal to `y`. Let `k` be the number of even values of `i`. Then, `k <= i/2` and `y = k`. Also, since `x` is incremented in every iteration, `x >= i`. Therefore, we can add the following loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i%2 == k%2;\n    loop invariant k <= i/2;\n    loop invariant y == k;\n    loop invariant x >= i;\n*/\n```\nThe first loop invariant ensures that the parity of `i` and `k` are the same, which implies that `i` and `k` have the same number of even values. The second loop invariant bounds the value of `k` by the number of even values that `i` can take. The third loop invariant simply states that `y` is equal to `k`. Finally, the fourth loop invariant ensures that `x` is always greater than or equal to `i`.\n\n**Step 4: Loop invariants implication**\n\nWe need to check whether the loop invariants imply the post-condition `x == 2*y`. Let's use implication to verify this:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n    loop invariant i >= 0;\n    loop invariant i <= n;\n    loop invariant i%2 == k%2;\n    loop invariant k <= i/2;\n    loop invariant y == k;\n    loop invariant x >= i;\n    \n    loop variant n-i;\n*/\nwhile(i<n) {\n    i++;\n    x++;\n    if(i%2 == 0) y++;\n}\n//@ assert i >= n && x==2*y;\n```\n\nWhen the loop terminates, `i` is greater than or equal to `n`. This implies that `i` is odd. Therefore, `k` is odd as well. Since `y` is equal to `k`, `y` is odd. Hence, `x` is even. Therefore, `x` is equal to `2*y`. This completes the proof that the loop invariants imply the post-condition.\n\n**Step 5: Putting everything together**\n\nThe final program with the loop invariants is:\n```\n#define assume(e) if(!(e)) return;\nextern int unknown(void);\n\nextern int unknown();\n\nvoid main()\n{\n  int x=0;\n  int y=0;\n  int i=0;\n  int n = unknown();\n  \n  /*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n    loop invariant i >= 0;\n    loop invariant i <= n;\n    loop invariant i"

Hence, y <= i/2 is a loop invariant.\n- The sum of x and y increases by 1 in each iteration of the loop. Since x starts from 0 and y starts from 0, the sum of x and y must be equal to (i+1)/2 after i iterations.
