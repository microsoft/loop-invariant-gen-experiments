Similarly, the loop invariant `y >= 0` holds throughout the loop, because `y` is also decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.\n\nThe loop invariant `x == i` holds before the loop execution, because `x` is assigned the value of `i` before the loop. Similarly, the loop invariant `y == j` holds before the loop execution, because `y` is assigned the value of `j` before the loop.\n\nThe loop invariant `x + y == i + j` holds in every iteration of the loop, because the sum of `x` and `y` is equal to the sum of `i` and `j`. This is because `x` and `y` are both decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.\n\nThe loop invariant `x == 0` holds after the loop termination, because the loop condition is `x!=0`, and the loop terminates when `x` becomes 0. Similarly, the loop invariant `y == j-i` holds after the loop termination, because `y` is decremented by the same amount as `x` in each iteration of the loop, and `x` is initially assigned the value of `i`, so the difference between `j` and `i` is preserved in `y`.\n\nFinally, since the assertion is guarded by the condition `i==j`, we need to include it in an implication in the loop invariant. Therefore, the final loop invariant is:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n    loop invariant x == i;\n    loop invariant y == j;\n    loop invariant x + y == i + j;\n    loop invariant (i==j) ==> (y==j-i);\n*/\n``` \n\nNote that we did not add any bounds on the variables `i`, `j`, `x`, and `y`, because we do not have any information about their values, except that `i` and `j` are assigned the values returned by the function `unknown1()`."

Therefore, `x` is always greater than or equal to 0. Similarly, `y` is also decremented by 1 in each iteration and is therefore greater than or equal to 0. Since `x` is initialized with the value of `i`, the maximum value of `x` is `i`. Therefore, `x` is always less than or equal to `i`. The same reasoning applies to `y` and `j`.\n\n- After the loop termination:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i == x ==> y == j;\n*/\n```\nExplanation: If `i` is equal to `x`, then the loop must have run `i` times and `x` would have become 0. Therefore, `y` would also have become `j - i`. If `i` is not equal to `x`, then the loop would have terminated before `x` becomes 0, and `y` would not necessarily be equal to `j - i`. This loop invariant is used to handle the conditional nature of the code.\n\n- Using the guard condition in an implication:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant (i != j) ==> (y == j || x == 0);\n*/\n```\nExplanation: If `i` is not equal to `j`, then the assertion will not be executed. Therefore, the loop invariant is trivially true in this case. If `i` is equal to `j`, then the assertion will be executed and `y` should be equal to 0. Since `x` is decremented in each iteration of the loop, it must become 0 before the loop terminates. Therefore, either `y` is equal to `j - i` and `x` is 0, or `y` is 0 and `x` is not 0. This loop invariant is used to handle the guard condition in the assertion.\n\n- Handling non-deterministic variables:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i >= x >= 0;\n    loop invariant j >= y >= 0;\n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant (i == j) ==> (x == 0 ==> y == j);\n    loop invariant (i != j) ==> (y == j || x == 0);\n    loop invariant \\forall int k; 0 <= k < i ==> \\at(y,LoopEntry) == \\at(j - k, LoopEntry);\n*/\n```\nExplanation: Since `i` and `j` are assigned the return value of an external function `unknown1()`, they are non-deterministic at the beginning of the loop. Therefore, their values could be any integer value and the loop invariants should be true for all possible values. The first three loop invariants handle the upper and lower bounds on the variables `i`, `j`, `x` and `y`. The fourth loop invariant uses implication to handle the conditional nature of the code. If `i` is equal to `j`, then `y` should be equal to `j - x` at the end of the loop. Therefore, if `x` becomes 0 before the loop terminates, then `y` should be equal to `j`. The fifth loop invariant uses implication to handle the guard condition in the assertion. The last loop invariant states that if `i` is equal to `j`,"
