The third and fourth loop invariants state that both `old` and `new` are non-negative integers and less than or equal to the maximum unsigned integer value, since their initial values are non-negative integers and `UINT_MAX` is the maximum possible value for an unsigned integer.\n- During each iteration of the loop, `old` and `new` remain non-negative integers and less than or equal to `UINT_MAX`. Moreover, the last loop invariant states that either `lock` is 0 and `new` is equal to `old+1` or `lock` is 1 and `new` is equal to `old`.\n- After the loop terminates, `lock` is always 1, since the loop condition is the negation of `new != old`, and the only way to exit the loop is when `new` is equal to `old`. Hence, the last loop invariant `!(lock == 0)` is equivalent to `lock == 1`. Also, `new` is equal to `old` at the end of the loop, which is captured by the second last loop invariant. Finally, the first loop invariant is not necessary anymore after the loop termination, but it is included for completeness."

If `unknown()` returns a non-zero value, then the value of `lock` is set to `0` and the value of `new` is incremented.\n\nNow, let's consider the pre-conditions and variable assignments:\n\n- `old` is assigned the value of `unknown_uint()`.\n- `lock` is assigned the value `0`.\n- `new` is assigned the value of `old + 1`.\n\nBased on this, we can come up with the following loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@ \nloop invariant new > old;\nloop invariant lock == 1 ==> new == old+1;\nloop invariant lock == 0 ==> new == old;\nloop invariant lock >= 0 && lock <= 1;\n*/\n```\n\nExplanation of the loop invariants:\n- The first invariant `new > old` ensures that `new` is always greater than `old` inside the loop.\n- The second invariant `lock == 1 ==> new == old+1` ensures that if `lock` is equal to `1`, then `new` is equal to `old+1`. This invariant holds because of the assignment statement `new = old + 1` before the loop and the conditional statement that increments `new` only when `lock` is equal to `0`.\n- The third invariant `lock == 0 ==> new == old` ensures that if `lock` is equal to `0`, then `new` is equal to `old`. This invariant holds because of the conditional statement that increments `new` only when `lock` is equal to `0`.\n- The fourth invariant `lock >= 0 && lock <= 1` ensures that `lock` can only take on the values `0` or `1`.\n\nFinally, since the assertion `!(lock == 0)` is guarded by the loop, we can use the loop condition in an implication to include it in the loop invariant:\n\n```\n/*@ \nloop invariant new > old;\nloop invariant lock == 1 ==> new == old+1;\nloop invariant lock == 0 ==> new == old;\nloop invariant lock >= 0 && lock <= 1;\nloop invariant !(new != old) ==> !(lock == 0);\n*/\n``` \n\nThis set of loop invariants is sufficient to verify the post-condition."

If `lock` is 1, then `new` is updated to `old+1`. If `lock` is 0, then `new` is still updated to `old+1` because of the `else` clause.\n3. `0 <= old <= new` (In every iteration of the loop)\n   - This is true because inside the loop, `new` is updated to either `old+1` or the return value of `unknown()`, depending on the value of `lock`. In either case, `new` is always greater than or equal to `old`.\n4. `(lock == 1 && !unknown()) ==> new == old+1` (In every iteration of the loop)\n   - This is true because if `lock` is 1 and `unknown()` returns false, then `new` is updated to `old+1`.\n5. `!(lock == 0)` (After the loop termination)\n   - This is true because the loop terminates only when `new == old`. So, if the loop terminates, then `new` is equal to `old` and `lock` must be equal to 1, which implies that `!(lock == 0)`.\n\nPutting it all together, the loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= old <= new;\n    loop invariant (lock == 1 ==> new == old+1) && (lock == 0 ==> new == old+1);\n    loop invariant 0 <= old <= new;\n    loop invariant (lock == 1 && !unknown()) ==> new == old+1;\n    loop invariant !(lock == 0);\n*/\n```"

The value of `old` is initialized with the return value of `unknown_uint()` which is an external function. The value of `lock` is initialized with 0 and the value of `new` is initialized with `old + 1`.\n\nLoop condition:\n- The while loop runs until the value of `new` is not equal to `old`.\n\nLoop invariants:\n- Before loop execution: \n  - `lock == 0 ==> new == old+1`\n  - `lock == 1 ==> new == old`\n  - `0 <= old <= UINT_MAX`\n  - `0 <= new <= UINT_MAX`\n- In every iteration of the loop:\n  - `0 <= old <= UINT_MAX`\n  - `0 <= new <= UINT_MAX`\n  - `(lock == 0 && new == old+1) || (lock == 1 && new == old)`\n- After loop termination:\n  - `lock == 1`\n  - `new == old`\n  - `!(lock == 0)`\n\nExplanation:\n- Before the loop starts, the value of `lock` is 0, `old` and `new` are initialized to some values. The first two loop invariants state that if `lock` is 0, then `new` should be equal to `old+1`, otherwise if `lock` is 1, then `new` should be equal to `old`. The third and fourth loop invariants state that both `old` and `new` are non-negative integers and less than or equal to the maximum unsigned integer value, since their initial values are non-negative integers and `UINT_MAX` is the maximum possible value for an unsigned integer.\n- During each iteration of the loop, `old` and `new` remain non-negative integers and less than or equal to `UINT_MAX`. Moreover, the last loop invariant states that either `lock` is 0 and `new` is equal to `old+1` or `lock` is 1 and `new` is equal to `old`.\n- After the loop terminates, `lock` is always 1, since the loop condition is the negation of `new != old`, and the only way to exit the loop is when `new` is equal to `old`. Hence, the last loop invariant `!(lock == 0)` is equivalent to `lock == 1`. Also, `new` is equal to `old` at the end of the loop, which is captured by the second last loop invariant. Finally, the first loop invariant is not necessary anymore after the loop termination, but it is included for completeness.",
