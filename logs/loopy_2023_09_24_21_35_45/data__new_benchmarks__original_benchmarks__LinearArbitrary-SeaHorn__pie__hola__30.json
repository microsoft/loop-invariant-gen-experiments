Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, `c` is the sum of integers from 0 to `i-1`. The range of `i` is from 0 to 1000, inclusive. Therefore, the loop invariant for every iteration is `c == \\sum_{j=0}^{i-1} j && 0 <= i <= 1000`.\n- After the loop termination, `i` is equal to 1000 because the loop executes until `i` is less than 1000 and then exits. `c` is the sum of integers from 0 to 999 because the last value of `i` in the loop is 999. The formula for the sum of integers from 0 to n is `n(n+1)/2`. Therefore, `c` is equal to `999*1000/2`, which is greater than or equal to 0. Hence, the loop invariant after the loop termination is `c == \\sum_{j=0}^{999} j && i == 1000 && c >= 0`.\n- Since there are no non-deterministic variables in the program, we do not need to use implications to make the loop invariants true."

Therefore, `c` should always be equal to the sum of all integers from 0 to `i-1`. `i` is always greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1000.\n- After the loop terminates, `i` is equal to 1000, which is the value that caused the loop to terminate, and `c` should be the sum of all integers from 0 to 999, which is the sum of all integers from 0 to 999 plus 1000. Therefore, `c` should be greater than or equal to 0."

It can be easily proved by mathematical induction. Since c is the sum of the first i-1 natural numbers before executing the current iteration, and i is incremented by 1 in each iteration, c will be the sum of the first i natural numbers after executing the current iteration.\n- After the loop termination: \n    - i == 1000: Since the loop condition is i < 1000, the loop terminates when i becomes 1000.\n    - c == 499500: This is the sum of the first 1000 natural numbers, which can be calculated using the formula (n*(n+1))/2, where n is the last natural number in the series. In this case, n is 1000, so the sum is (1000*(1000+1))/2 = 500*1000 = 500000. However, c is the sum of the first 999 natural numbers before executing the last iteration, so we need to add 1000 to c, which gives 499500.\n\nAll the loop invariants are as follows:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i >= 0;\n    loop invariant i <= 1000;\n    loop invariant c == (i*(i-1))/2;\n*/\n```"

The sum of the first `i` natural numbers can be calculated using the formula `i*(i+1)/2`.\n\nNow, let's check if these loop invariants are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination, and if they imply the post-condition:\n- Before the loop execution: Both loop invariants are true since `i = 0` and `c = 0` satisfy them.\n- In every iteration of the loop: \n    - The first loop invariant is true since `i` is incremented by `1` in each iteration and the new value of `i` is still between `0` and `1000`.\n    - The second loop invariant is true since the new value of `c` is equal to the old value of `c` plus `i`, which is between `0` and the sum of the first `i` natural numbers.\n- After the loop termination: Both loop invariants are true since `i = 1000` and `c = 1000*999/2 = 499500` satisfy them.\n- The loop invariants imply the post-condition since the second loop invariant states that `c` is always between `0` and the sum of the first `i` natural numbers, which is greater than or equal to `0`. Therefore, `c` is always greater than or equal to `0`, which is the post-condition.\n\nWe can also add an implication to make the loop invariant trivially true at the beginning, since both `i` and `c` are initialized to `0`:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant (i == 0 && c == 0) ==> (0 <= i <= 1000 && 0 <= c <= i*(i+1)/2);\n    loop invariant 0 <= i <= 1000;\n    loop invariant 0 <= c <= i*(i+1)/2;\n*/\n```\n\nTherefore, the final loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant (i == 0 && c == 0) ==> (0 <= i <= 1000 && 0 <= c <= i*(i+1)/2);\n    loop invariant 0 <= i <= 1000;\n    loop invariant 0 <= c <= i*(i+1)/2;\n*/\n```"

This is because the loop body adds i to c, and i is incremented by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, after k iterations, c would have been incremented by 0+1+2+...+(k-1)+k, which is equal to k*(k+1)/2. This invariant holds true before the loop is executed, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop terminates.\n- Since there are no non-deterministic variables, no additional implications are needed.\n\nFinally, we can verify that the post-condition c>=0 is implied by the loop invariants. The loop invariants ensure that the value of c is always greater than or equal to 0, and the loop terminates when i reaches 1000, so the value of c at the end of the loop must be greater than or equal to 0.

Therefore, the loop invariant for every iteration is `c == \\sum_{j=0}^{i-1} j && 0 <= i <= 1000`.\n- After the loop termination, `i` is equal to 1000 because the loop executes until `i` is less than 1000 and then exits. `c` is the sum of integers from 0 to 999 because the last value of `i` in the loop is 999.
