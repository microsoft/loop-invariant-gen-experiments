It ensures that the loop variable `i` is within the bounds of 1 and SIZE+1, and that the loop executes exactly SIZE times.\n- The loop invariant `sn = (i-1)*a` is true before the first iteration of the loop (since i=1 and sn=0 at the beginning of the loop), and is preserved in every iteration of the loop. It ensures that the sum `sn` is equal to `i-1` times the constant `a` at each iteration of the loop.\n- The loop invariant `sn == SIZE*a` is true after the loop termination.

This is true because `sn` is initialized to 0 at the beginning of the program.\n\nFor every iteration of the loop, we can add the loop invariant `sn == (i-1)*a`. This is true because before each iteration, `sn` is equal to `(i-1)*a` (by the induction hypothesis), and after the iteration, `sn` is updated to `i*a`.\n\nAfter the loop termination, we need to show that `sn==SIZE*a || sn == 0`. We can use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. We know that the loop terminates when `i` exceeds `SIZE`. So, if `sn==SIZE*a` holds after the loop termination, we must have `i == SIZE + 1`. Therefore, we can add the loop invariant `(sn==SIZE*a) ==> (i==SIZE+1)`.\n\nCombining all the loop invariants, we get:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant sn==0;\n    loop invariant \\forall integer j; 1 <= j <= i-1 ==> sn == (j-1)*a;\n    loop invariant (sn==SIZE*a) ==> (i==SIZE+1);\n*/\n```\nNote that we used the universal quantifier to express the loop invariant for `sn`. This is because the value of `sn` changes in every iteration, and we want to express a relation between its values at different points of the loop.

The extra `+1` is because the loop condition is `i<=SIZE` and we want to include the final value of `i` in the range.\n- The second loop invariant states that `sn` is the sum of `a` from `j=1` to `j=i-1`. This is equivalent to adding `a` to `sn` in each iteration of the loop.\n- The third loop invariant states that `sn` is always less than or equal to `SIZE*a`. This is because `sn` is the sum of `a` added `SIZE` times, and therefore cannot be larger than `SIZE*a`.\n\nFinally, we can use the implication to verify the post-condition:\n```\n//@ assert (i == SIZE+1) ==> (sn==SIZE*a);\n//@ assert (i < SIZE+1) ==> (sn <= SIZE*a);\n```\nExplanation:\n- The first assertion states that if `i` is equal to `SIZE+1` at the end of the loop, then `sn` must be equal to `SIZE*a` to satisfy the post-condition.\n- The second assertion states that if `i` is less than `SIZE+1` at the end of the loop, then `sn` must be less than or equal to `SIZE*a` to satisfy the post-condition."
