If this condition is not satisfied, the program returns 0.\n- The program enters a while loop and iteratively subtracts 4 from `x` and 1 from `y` until `x` becomes less than or equal to 0.\n- Finally, the program checks if `y` is greater than or equal to 0.\n\nLoop condition:\n- The while loop iterates as long as `x` is greater than 0.\n\nLoop invariants:\n- Before loop execution:\n  - `x == 4*y` (pre-condition)\n  - `x >= 0` (pre-condition)\n  - `y >= 0` (assertion)\n\n- In every iteration:\n  - `x + 4*y` is constant\n  - `x >= 0`\n  - `y >= 0`\n\n- After loop termination:\n  - `x + 4*y` is constant\n  - `x < 4`\n  - `y >= 0`\n  - `(x == 0) ==> (y == 4*y_old)`\n\nThe loop invariant `x + 4*y` is constant because in every iteration of the loop, 4 is subtracted from `x` and 1 is subtracted from `y`.\n\nThe loop invariant `x >= 0` is true because `x` is decremented by 4 in every iteration.\n\nThe loop invariant `y >= 0` is true because `y` is decremented by 1 in every iteration and `y` is initially greater than or equal to 0.\n\nAfter the loop terminates, `x` is less than or equal to 0. Since `x` is decremented by 4 in every iteration, we know that `x` is greater than or equal to -4. Therefore, `x` can only take the values -4, -8, -12, or any other value less than or equal to -4. Since `x` is an integer and 4 divides it, the only possible value of `x` that satisfies the pre-condition `x == 4*y` is 0. Therefore, we have `(x == 0) ==> (y == 4*y_old)` as an invariant.\n\nNote that we use `y_old` to denote the value of `y` before the loop execution. This is necessary because `y` is modified in the loop body.\n\nFinally, the loop invariant `x < 4` holds because `x` is decremented by 4 in every iteration and it starts with a value that is a multiple of 4. Therefore, `x` can only take values -4, -8, -12, or any other value less than or equal to -4."

This is true because the loop terminates when `x` becomes zero, which means that `4*y` is the maximum value of `x` that satisfies the loop condition. Therefore, `x` must be equal to `4*y` at the end of the loop, and `y` must be non-negative because it can only be decremented by `1` in each iteration.",
