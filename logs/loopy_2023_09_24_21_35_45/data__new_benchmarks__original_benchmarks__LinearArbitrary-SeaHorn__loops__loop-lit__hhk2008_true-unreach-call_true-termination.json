This is because `res` is initially assigned the value of `a`, and in each iteration of the loop, it is incremented by 1. Since `cnt` is also decremented by 1 in each iteration, the difference between `b` and `cnt` decreases by 1, which is added to `a` to get the new value of `res`.\n- The third loop invariant `cnt >= 0 ==> res >= a` ensures that if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 0, then `res` is greater than or equal to `a`. This is because in each iteration of the loop, `res` is incremented by 1, and since `a` is added to `res` only once at the beginning, `res` is always greater than or equal to `a`.\n- The fourth loop invariant `cnt == 0 ==> res == a + b` ensures that when `cnt` becomes 0, `res` is equal to the sum of `a` and `b`. This is the post-condition that we want to prove. This loop invariant holds because at this point, all iterations of the loop have been completed, and since `res` is incremented by 1 in each iteration and `cnt` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, `res` must be equal to `a + b`.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants that can be used to help Frama-C verify the post-condition are:\n```\n/*@\n    loop invariant 0 <= cnt <= b;\n    loop invariant res == a + (b - cnt);\n    loop invariant cnt >= 0 ==> res >= a;\n    loop invariant cnt == 0 ==> res == a + b;\n*/\n```"

Therefore, the value of res should be the original value of a plus the number of iterations executed so far, which is (b - cnt).\n    - cnt >= 0\n        - This is true because cnt is initialized with b, which is assumed to be non-negative. In each iteration, cnt is decremented by 1, and since cnt is initialized with a non-negative value, it will remain non-negative throughout the loop execution.\n- In every iteration of the loop:\n    - res == a + (b - cnt)\n        - This is the same as the first loop invariant, and it holds true because the loop body only increments the value of res by 1 in each iteration, and decrements the value of cnt by 1.\n    - cnt >= 0\n        - This is the same as the second loop invariant, and it holds true because cnt is decremented by 1 in each iteration, and it is initialized with a non-negative value.\n- After the loop termination:\n    - res == a + b\n        - This is the post-condition, and it holds true because the loop executes b times, and in each iteration, the value of res is incremented by 1, so the final value of res should be a + b.\n    - cnt == 0\n        - This is true because the loop terminates when cnt becomes 0, and it is decremented by 1 in each iteration.
