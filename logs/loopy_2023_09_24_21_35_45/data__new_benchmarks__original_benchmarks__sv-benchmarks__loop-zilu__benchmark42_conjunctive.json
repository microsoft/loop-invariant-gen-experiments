Therefore, `x >= 0` is a loop invariant.\n- The initial condition `x + y + z == 0` should hold throughout the program execution as it's not modified anywhere in the program.\n- `z = 2*(y-x)` is a loop invariant because `y` is decremented by 1 and `x` is decremented by 1, therefore `z` is incremented by 2 in every iteration.\n- If `x > 0`, then the loop executes at least once. At the beginning of the loop, we have `x + y + z == \\at(x, Pre) + \\at(y, Pre) + \\at(z, Pre)` because `x`, `y`, and `z` are not modified outside the loop. Also, `z` is incremented by 2 in each iteration, so `z = 2*(\\at(y, Pre) - \\at(x, Pre))` holds after the first iteration.\n- If `x <= 0`, the loop does not execute. In this case, the post-condition holds trivially, so we can add an implication to make the invariant true. `z <= 0 ==> x + y + z == \\at(x, Pre) + \\at(y, Pre) + \\at(z, Pre)` holds because if `z <= 0`, then `x+y+z` must equal its initial value. Also, `z <= 0 ==> z <= \\at(z, Pre)` holds trivially because `z` can never be greater than its initial value."
