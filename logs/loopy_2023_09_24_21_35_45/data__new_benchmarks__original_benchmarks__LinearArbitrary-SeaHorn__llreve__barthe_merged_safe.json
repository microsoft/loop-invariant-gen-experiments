Before the loop execution:\n- `j1 == c`\n- `x1 == 0`\n- `j2 == c`\n- `x2 == 0`\nExplanation: Before the loop starts, `i` is initialized to 0, and all other variables are initialized to their respective values, i.e., `j1 = 0 + c`, `x1 = 0`, `j2 = c`, and `x2 = 0`. Therefore, the above loop invariants hold true before the loop starts.\n\n2.

Thus, `j2` is always equal to `c + 5 * i`. Also, `x1` is updated as `x1 = x1 + j1`, and `x2` is updated as `x2 = x2 + j2`. Therefore, `x1` and `x2` are the sum of all `j1` and `j2` values respectively. We can observe that `j1` and `j2` are updated in such a way that they always remain equal, and `x1` and `x2` are updated in the same way. Thus, `j1 == j2` and `x1 == x2`. Therefore, the above loop invariants hold true in every iteration of the loop.\n\n3. After the loop termination:\n- `x1 == (n * (5 * n + 2 * c)) / 2`\n- `x2 == (n * (5 * n + 2 * c)) / 2`\nExplanation: After the loop terminates, the value of `i` is equal to `n`. Thus, `j1 == 5 * n + c` and `j2 == c + 5 * n`. Therefore, `j1 == j2`. Also, `x1` and `x2` are updated in each iteration of the loop as `x1 = x1 + j1` and `x2 = x2 + j2`. Therefore, `x1` and `x2` are the sum of all `j1` and `j2` values respectively. We can observe that the sum of the first `n` odd numbers is `n^2`. Therefore, the sum of the first `n` terms of the arithmetic sequence `5i + 2c` is `(n/2) * (2c + (5n - 5)) = (n/2) * (5n + 2c - 5) = (n * (5n + 2c))/2`. Therefore, `x1` and `x2` are equal to `(n * (5n + 2c))/2`. Thus, the above loop invariants hold true after the loop termination.\n\nPutting all the loop invariants together, we get:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant j1 == c;\n    loop invariant x1 == 0;\n    loop invariant j2 == c;\n    loop invariant x2 == 0;\n    \n    loop invariant j1 == 5 * i + c;\n    loop invariant j2 == c + 5 * i;\n    loop invariant x1 == i * (5 * i + 2 * c);\n    loop invariant x2 == i * (5 * i + 2 * c);\n    \n    loop invariant j1 == j2;\n    loop invariant x1 == x2;\n    \n    loop invariant x1 == (n * (5 * n + 2 * c)) / 2;\n    loop invariant x2 == (n * (5 * n + 2 * c)) / 2;\n*/\n```"

Since `j2` is assigned the value `c` at the beginning and incremented by `5` in each iteration, its maximum value occurs when `i` is `n` and its minimum value occurs when `i` is `0`. Thus, its range is between `c` and `c + 5*(n-i)`.\n- The fourth invariant specifies the range of values that `x1` can take. Since `x1` is assigned the value `x1 + j1` in each iteration, its maximum value occurs when `j1` is at its maximum and `i` is `n`. Its minimum value occurs when `i` is `0` and `j1` is `0`.

Finally, `j2` is updated to `c + 5 * (i - 1)`, which ensures that its value is always greater than or equal to `c`.\n- After the loop termination, `x1` is updated one last time with the final value of `j1`, which is `5 * (n - 1) + c`.
