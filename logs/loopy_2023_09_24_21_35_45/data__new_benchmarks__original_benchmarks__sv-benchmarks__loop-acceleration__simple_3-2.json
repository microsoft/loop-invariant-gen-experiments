Since `x` is initialized to 0, we can say that `x >= 0`. Similarly, since `N` is assigned a value returned by `unknown_ushort()` function, we can say that `N >= 0`. Therefore, the following loop invariants are true before the loop execution:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant N >= 0;\n*/\n```\nNow, let's find loop invariants that are true in every iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the following loop invariant is true in every iteration of the loop:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x % 2 == 0;\n*/\n```\nNow, let's find loop invariants that are true after the loop termination. Since the loop terminates when `x` is greater than or equal to `N`, we can say that `x >= N`. Also, since `x` is always even in every iteration, we can say that `N` is either even or odd and the parity of `N` determines whether `x` is equal to `N` or greater than `N`. If `N` is even, then `x` will be equal to `N` and if `N` is odd, then `x` will be greater than `N`. Therefore, the following loop invariants are true after the loop termination:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= N;\n    loop invariant (N % 2 == 0 ==> x == N) && (N % 2 == 1 ==> x > N);\n*/\n```\nNow, we need to ensure that the loop invariants imply the post-condition. The post-condition is `!(x % 2)`. Since the loop invariant `x % 2 == 0` is true in every iteration of the loop and `x >= N`, we can say that `!(x % 2)` is true after the loop termination. Therefore, the loop invariants imply the post-condition.\n\nPutting everything together, the final code block with all the loop invariants is:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant N >= 0;\n    loop invariant x % 2 == 0;\n    loop invariant x >= N;\n    loop invariant (N % 2 == 0 ==> x == N) && (N % 2 == 1 ==> x > N);\n*/\n```"
