For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values. Do not use variables that have garbage values.**\n- **Do not use keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops.**\n- **Variables that are not explicitly initialized, could have garbage values.

Therefore, one possible loop invariant is:\n\n- `x != y ==> lock == 1`\n\nThis loop invariant states that if `x` is not equal to `y`, then `lock` must be equal to 1.

This means that `y` is either increasing or staying the same in each iteration of the loop. Therefore, we can add the following loop invariant:\n\n- `y >= \\old(y)`\n\nThis loop invariant states that `y` is either staying the same or increasing in each iteration of the loop.
