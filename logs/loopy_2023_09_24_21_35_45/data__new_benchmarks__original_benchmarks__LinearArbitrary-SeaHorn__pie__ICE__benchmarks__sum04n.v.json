Thus, `i>=1` and `sn == (i-1)*a` are true.\n- In each iteration of the loop, `i` is incremented by 1 and `sn` is updated by adding `a`. Thus, `i>=1`, `sn == (i-1)*a`, and `0 <= sn <= SIZE*a` are true.\n- After the loop termination, `i` is greater than `SIZE` and `sn` is equal to the sum of `a` from `1` to `SIZE`. Thus, `i<=SIZE+1` and `sn == SIZE*a` are true. Using implication, we can conclude that `sn==SIZE*a || sn == 0` holds at the end of the loop.",
