Here are some possible loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@\nloop invariant 0 <= i <= INT_MAX;\nloop invariant x == 0;\n*/\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The first invariant ensures that `i` remains within the bounds of an `int` variable.\n- The second invariant states that `x` always has the value 0.\n\nHowever, these invariants are not sufficient to prove the post-condition, which states that `x` is not equal to 0 after the loop terminates. We need to strengthen the loop invariants.\n\nOne possible approach is to use the fact that the loop runs indefinitely to our advantage. Since we know that the loop does not terminate, we can assume that `i` will eventually exceed some threshold. We can then use this assumption to prove that `x` is not equal to 0 after the loop terminates.

This is because the loop body contains an assertion that `x` is equal to 0, and the loop condition is always true. Therefore, if `x` is still equal to 0 after `i` reaches `n`, the loop would have terminated, which contradicts our assumption that the loop runs indefinitely.\n- The third invariant states that if `x` is not equal to 0, then `i` is greater than or equal to `n`. This is because the loop runs indefinitely, and `i` keeps increasing. Therefore, if `x` is not equal to 0, then `i` must eventually exceed `n`.\n\nThese loop invariants are sufficient to prove the post-condition."

Therefore, the loop invariants must hold before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n\nThe post-condition of the program is `x != 0`.
