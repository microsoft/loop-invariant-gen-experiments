We cannot make any assumptions about `n` and `m`. Therefore, we cannot have any non-trivial loop invariants that hold before the loop execution.\n\nDuring the loop, `i` is multiplied by 2 or 3 depending on the value of `m`. Therefore, `i` will be a power of 2 or 3 after each iteration. However, we cannot make any assumptions about the relationship between `n` and `i` unless we know the value of `m`. Therefore, we cannot have any non-trivial loop invariants that hold in every iteration of the loop.\n\nAfter the loop, we know that `i` is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, the following loop invariant holds:\n\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant i >= 1;\n*/\n```\n\nHowever, this invariant is not strong enough to imply the post-condition `i > 0`. We need to find additional loop invariants.\n\nLet `j` be the number of iterations of the loop. We have `i = 2^k` or `i = 3^k` after each iteration, where `k` is the number of times `i` was multiplied by 2 or 3. Therefore, we have the following loop invariant:\n\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant (i == 2^k || i == 3^k) && k <= j;\n*/\n```\n\nThis loop invariant holds in every iteration of the loop. Note that we use implication to handle the conditional nature of the code: if `m > 0`, then `i` is multiplied by 2, which means that `k` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `i` is multiplied by 3, which means that `k` is incremented by 1 as well.\n\nFinally, we can combine the two loop invariants to obtain the following loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant i >= 1;\n  loop invariant (i == 2^k || i == 3^k) && k <= j;\n*/\n```\n\nThese loop invariants hold before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination, and they imply the post-condition `i > 0`."

Since we do not have any pre-conditions, we do not need any loop invariants for the first condition.\n\nFor the second condition, we need to find loop invariants that are true in every iteration of the loop. We can start by looking at the code inside the loop. We see that `i` is updated in each iteration, either by multiplying it by 2 or by 3. Therefore, we can say that `i` is always a power of 2 or a power of 3, depending on the value of `m`. We can use this observation to come up with the following loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@ \n   loop invariant i > 0;\n   loop invariant (i % 2 == 0) ==> (i <= n);\n   loop invariant (i % 3 == 0) ==> (i <= n);\n*/\n```\nThe first invariant simply states that `i` is always positive. The second invariant states that if `i` is a power of 2, then it must be less than or equal to `n`. The third invariant states that if `i` is a power of 3, then it must be less than or equal to `n`.\n\nFinally, we need to find loop invariants that imply the post-condition. The post-condition is simply `i > 0`. We can use the first invariant we came up with, `i > 0`, to directly imply the post-condition. Therefore, we do not need any additional loop invariants for this condition.\n\nPutting everything together, we get the following loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@ \n   loop invariant i > 0;\n   loop invariant (i % 2 == 0) ==> (i <= n);\n   loop invariant (i % 3 == 0) ==> (i <= n);\n*/\n```"
