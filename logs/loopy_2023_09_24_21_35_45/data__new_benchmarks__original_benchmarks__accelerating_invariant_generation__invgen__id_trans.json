Therefore, `j` is always greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to `idBitLength / 8` and `material_length`.\n- The second loop invariant is true for the same reason as the first one, but it explicitly bounds `j` by `material_length`.\n- The third loop invariant is true because `nlen` is assumed to be equal to `idBitLength / 32`, and `j/4` is an integer division of `j` by 4. Therefore, `j/4` is always greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to `nlen`.\n- The fourth loop invariant is true because it states that if `j` is greater than or equal to `idBitLength / 8`, then it must also be greater than or equal to `material_length`. This is because the loop condition is `(j < idBitLength / 8) && (j < material_length)`, which is equivalent to `(j < idBitLength / 8) || (j < material_length)`. Therefore, if `j >= idBitLength / 8`, then `(j < material_length)` must be false, which implies that `j >= material_length`. Note that we use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code.\n\nFinally, we add the conjunctions that bound the maximum and minimum values of the variables:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= j <= idBitLength / 8;\n    loop invariant 0 <= j <= material_length;\n    loop invariant 0 <= j/4 <= nlen;\n    loop invariant j >= idBitLength / 8 ==> j >= material_length;\n    loop invariant idBitLength >= 0;\n    loop invariant material_length >= 0;\n    loop invariant nlen >= 0;\n*/\n```"

However, since `idBitLength` must be a multiple of 32, we can add the following constraint to the pre-condition:\n```\n/*@ \n    requires idBitLength % 32 == 0;\n*/\n```\n\nFinally, we need to verify that these loop invariants imply the post-condition. The program does not have an explicit post-condition, so we will assume that the post-condition is that the program terminates normally. Since the loop is a finite loop and the loop invariants do not depend on any non-deterministic values, the loop invariants will hold after the loop terminates, implying that the program terminates normally. Therefore, the loop invariants imply the post-condition."
