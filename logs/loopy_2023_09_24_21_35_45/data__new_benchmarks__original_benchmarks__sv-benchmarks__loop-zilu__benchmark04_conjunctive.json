Since the loop only decrements `k` and increments `j`, the value of `k` can only decrease, and the value of `j` can only increase.

The condition `k>=0 && j>=0` ensures that `k` and `j` are non-negative. The condition `k+j==\\at(k, Pre)+\\at(j, Pre)` ensures that the sum of `k` and `j` is preserved across iterations. The condition `(\\forall integer i; 0<=i<j ==> k+i>=n)` ensures that for each iteration of the loop, `k` is greater than or equal to `n` for all values of `j` up to the current value of `j`. This is because in each iteration, `k` is decremented by 1 and `j` is incremented by 1, which means that `k+i` is decreased by 1 for each `i` up to the current value of `j`. The conjunction of these conditions ensures that `k` is always greater than or equal to 0 during the loop execution.\n- After the loop: the condition `n>=1 && k>=n && j>n-1 && k>=0 && j>=0 && k+j==\\at(k, Pre)+\\at(j, Pre)` ensures that `k` is greater than or equal to `n` at the end of the loop execution, `j` is greater than `n-1`, and the sum of `k` and `j` is preserved across iterations.
