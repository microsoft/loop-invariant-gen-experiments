The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `LARGE_INT`. The loop body is empty.\n\nPre-conditions: None.\n\nLoop condition: `i < LARGE_INT`.\n\nPost-condition: `i == LARGE_INT`.\n\nLoop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= i <= LARGE_INT;\n    loop invariant i <= LARGE_INT;\n    loop invariant i == \\at(i, Pre) || i == \\at(i, Pre) + 1;\n    loop invariant (i == LARGE_INT) ==> (\\at(i, Pre) == LARGE_INT - 1);\n*/\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The first loop invariant ensures that `i` is always between `0` and `LARGE_INT`. This is true before the loop starts, in every iteration, and after the loop terminates. \n- The second loop invariant is a simplification of the first one, stating that `i` is always less than or equal to `LARGE_INT`. This is true before the loop starts, in every iteration, and after the loop terminates. \n- The third loop invariant ensures that `i` is incremented by `1` on every iteration. This is true in every iteration. The loop invariant also takes into account the initial value of `i`, which is `0`.\n- The fourth loop invariant is a special case of the third one, that applies when the loop terminates. It ensures that `i` is equal to `LARGE_INT`. The implication is true if the loop invariant holds before the last iteration, and the loop condition is false at the end of the last iteration. This is true because the loop condition is `i < LARGE_INT`, so if `i == LARGE_INT`, the loop condition is false. The implication is vacuously true if `i != LARGE_INT` before the last iteration, because the loop invariant would be false in that case."
