For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values. Do not use variables that have garbage values.**\n- **Do not use keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops.**\n- **Variables that are not explicitly initialized, could have garbage values.

This is a consequence of the if statement, which either increments `x` by 1 (if `y` is even) or by 2 (if `y` is odd). This implies that after each iteration of the loop, the parity of `x` changes, and the parity of `y` also changes accordingly.
