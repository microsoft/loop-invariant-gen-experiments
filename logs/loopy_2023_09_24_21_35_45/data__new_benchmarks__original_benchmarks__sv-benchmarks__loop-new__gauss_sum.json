Therefore, `i` is always between `1` and `n` inclusive. Also, the sum of the first `i-1` positive integers is `(i-1)*i/2`. Thus, at the end of each iteration, the value of `sum` is equal to the sum of the first `i-1` positive integers, which is `(i-1)*i/2`.\n- After the loop termination, the value of `sum` is equal to the sum of the first `n` positive integers, which is `n*(n+1)/2`.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 1 <= i <= n;\n    loop invariant sum == (i-1)*i/2;\n    loop invariant sum == n*(n+1)/2 ==> 2*sum == n*(n+1);\n*/\n```"

So, we can add the following loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant sum == \\sum (k=1..i-1) k; */\n```\nHere, `\\sum (k=1..i-1) k` means the sum of all integers from 1 to `i-1`. We need to use `i-1` because `i` is not yet updated in the current iteration.\n- The loop condition is `i <= n`. We can use this condition to add a loop invariant that bounds `i`:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant 1 <= i <= n+1; */\n```\nHere, we use `n+1` instead of `n` because the loop condition is `i <= n`, so when the loop terminates, `i` becomes `n+1`.\n- Now, we can use the loop invariants derived so far to prove the post-condition. We can use the loop invariant `sum == \\sum (k=1..i-1) k` to rewrite the post-condition as `2*\\sum (k=1..n) k == n*(n+1)`. We can then simplify this expression as `\\sum (k=1..n) k == n*(n+1)/2`. So, we can add the following loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant 2*sum == i*(i-1); */\n```\nHere, we use `i` instead of `n` because `i` is the variable that is used to update `sum` in each iteration of the loop.

The loop variant is a decreasing expression that is updated in each iteration of the loop and is bounded below by 0. In this case, `n-i` is a decreasing expression because `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration and the loop condition is `i <= n`. The loop variant is bounded below by 0 because `i` is initially set to 1 and `n` is at least 1 due to the pre-condition."
