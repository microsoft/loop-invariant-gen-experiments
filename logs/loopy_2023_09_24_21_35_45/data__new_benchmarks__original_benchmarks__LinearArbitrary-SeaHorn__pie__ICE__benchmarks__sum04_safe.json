This implies that `sn` can only be equal to `SIZE*a` if the loop has executed `SIZE` times. \nNote that we used implication here to take care of the conditional nature of the code.\n\nFinally, we can use the guard condition of the assertion to obtain the complete loop invariant:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant sn == 0;\n    loop invariant 1 <= i <= SIZE+1;\n    loop invariant \\forall integer j; 1 <= j < i ==> sn == (j-1)*a;\n    loop invariant sn == SIZE*a ==> i == SIZE+1;\n    loop invariant !(i <= SIZE) ==> (sn==0);\n*/\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- The fifth loop invariant uses the guard condition of the assertion (`!(i <= SIZE)`) to add an implication that if the loop terminates early (i.e., when `i` is not greater than `SIZE`), then `sn` must be 0.
