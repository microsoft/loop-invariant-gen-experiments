After the loop terminates, `x` will be equal to 100, so the invariant will still hold true.\n- The loop invariant `y == 2` ==> `0 <= y <= 2` ensures that `y` is always either 0, 1, or 2, and holds true in every iteration of the loop. Since the assertion checks that `y` is equal to 2, we add the implication `y == 2` to the invariant.\n- The loop invariant `z == 400` ==> `z >= 400` ensures that `z` is always greater than or equal to 400, and holds true in every iteration of the loop. Since the assertion checks that `z` is equal to 400, we add the implication `z == 400` to the invariant.\n- The loop invariant `x <= 25` ==> `z >= 1` ensures that if `x` is less than or equal to 25, then `z` is greater than or equal to 1, and holds true in every iteration of the loop. This is because `z` is incremented by 1 when `x` is less than 25, and `z` is always greater than or equal to 1 after this operation. We add similar invariants for the ranges `(25 < x <= 50)` and `(50 < x <= 100)`.\n- The loop invariant `0 <= y <= 2` and `z >= 400` ==> `x <= 100` ensures that if `y` is between 0 and 2, and `z` is greater than or equal to 400, then `x` is less than or equal to 100. This is because the loop increments `x` by 1 in each iteration, and stops when `x` is greater than or equal to 100. \n- The loop invariant `0 <= x <= 100` and `0 <= y <= 2` and `z >= 400` ==> `z >= (x-25)*4 + 1` ensures that `z` is always greater than or equal to `(x-25)*4 + 1`. This is because `z` is incremented by 1 when `x` is less than 25, and `z` is incremented by 4 when `x` is greater than or equal to 25.

Therefore, if y equals 2, then x must equal 100.\n- For the assertion `x == 100`, we can use the first loop invariant, which states that x is always between 0 and 100, inclusive.

Here are some possible loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n\tloop invariant 0 <= x <= 100;\n\tloop invariant y == (x <= 50 ? x : 100 - x);\n\tloop invariant z == (x < 25 ? x : 5 * (x - 24));\n*/\n```\nExplanation of loop invariants:\n- The first loop invariant specifies that x is always between 0 and 100.\n- The second loop invariant specifies that y is either equal to x or equal to 100 - x, depending on the value of x. This is because y is incremented by 1 when x is less than or equal to 50, and decremented by 1 when x is greater than 50. Therefore, y is equal to x when x is less than or equal to 50, and y is equal to 100 - x when x is greater than 50.\n- The third loop invariant specifies that z is either equal to x or equal to 5 * (x - 24), depending on the value of x. This is because z is incremented by 1 when x is less than 25, and incremented by 5 when x is greater than or equal to 25. Therefore, z is equal to x when x is less than 25, and z is equal to 5 * (x - 24) when x is greater than or equal to 25.\n\nFinally, we need to show that the loop invariants imply the post-conditions:\n- The loop invariant 0 <= x <= 100 implies that x == 100 after the loop termination.\n- The loop invariant y == (x <= 50 ? x : 100 - x) implies that y == (100 <= 50 ? 100 : 100 - 100) == 0 after the loop termination.\n- The loop invariant z == (x < 25 ? x : 5 * (x - 24)) implies that z == (100 < 25 ? 100 : 5 * (100 - 24)) == 400 after the loop termination.\nTherefore, the loop invariants imply the post-conditions, and the program is correct."

After the loop terminates, `x` will be equal to 100, so the invariant will still hold true.\n- The loop invariant `y == 2` ==> `0 <= y <= 2` ensures that `y` is always either 0, 1, or 2, and holds true in every iteration of the loop. Since the assertion checks that `y` is equal to 2, we add the implication `y == 2` to the invariant.\n- The loop invariant `z == 400` ==> `z >= 400` ensures that `z` is always greater than or equal to 400, and holds true in every iteration of the loop. Since the assertion checks that `z` is equal to 400, we add the implication `z == 400` to the invariant.\n- The loop invariant `x <= 25` ==> `z >= 1` ensures that if `x` is less than or equal to 25, then `z` is greater than or equal to 1, and holds true in every iteration of the loop. This is because `z` is incremented by 1 when `x` is less than 25, and `z` is always greater than or equal to 1 after this operation. We add similar invariants for the ranges `(25 < x <= 50)` and `(50 < x <= 100)`.\n- The loop invariant `0 <= y <= 2` and `z >= 400` ==> `x <= 100` ensures that if `y` is between 0 and 2, and `z` is greater than or equal to 400, then `x` is less than or equal to 100. This is because the loop increments `x` by 1 in each iteration, and stops when `x` is greater than or equal to 100. \n- The loop invariant `0 <= x <= 100` and `0 <= y <= 2` and `z >= 400` ==> `z >= (x-25)*4 + 1` ensures that `z` is always greater than or equal to `(x-25)*4 + 1`. This is because `z` is incremented by 1 when `x` is less than 25, and `z` is incremented by 4 when `x` is greater than or equal to 25.
