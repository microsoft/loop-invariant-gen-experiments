Therefore, if `x2 >= 0`, then `x2 - x3 <= 2` implies `x2 - x3 < 3`.\n- In every iteration of the loop, `x1`, `x2` and `x3` are assigned new values. However, their maximum and minimum values do not change, so the same loop invariants hold true.\n- After the loop, the assertion is checked. If the loop terminates normally, then `input` is 0.
