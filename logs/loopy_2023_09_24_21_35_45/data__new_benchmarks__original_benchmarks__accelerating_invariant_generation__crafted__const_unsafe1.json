We can observe that x is always assigned 0 in the loop, so we can add this to the loop invariant.\n\nIn every iteration: x == 0 && y < 10\n\nNext, we need to find loop invariants that are true after the loop termination. Since the loop terminates when y becomes greater than or equal to 10, we can add this condition to the loop invariant.\n\nAfter loop termination: x == 0 && y >= 10\n\nNow we need to check if the loop invariants imply the post condition x == 1. We can observe that the loop invariants do not imply x == 1. This is because x is always assigned 0 in the loop, and the loop invariant after the loop termination states that x == 0. Therefore, we need to modify the post-condition to reflect the change in x.\n\nPost-condition: x == 0 ==> y >= 10\n\nFinally, we need to add the implication of the guard condition, which is y < 10, to the loop invariants in every iteration.\n\nIn every iteration: (y < 10) ==> (x == 0)\n\nPutting it all together, we get the following loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x == 1 && y == 0; // before loop execution\n    loop invariant (y < 10) ==> (x == 0); // in every iteration\n    loop invariant x == 0 && y >= 10; // after loop termination\n*/\n```"
