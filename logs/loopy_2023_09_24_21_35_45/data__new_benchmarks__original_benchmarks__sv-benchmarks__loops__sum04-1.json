This holds true before the loop, because `i-1` is `0` and `(\\at(sn, Pre) + (i-1)/4 * a)` evaluates to `0`. It holds true in every iteration because the value of `i` is incremented by `1` in every iteration and the value of `sn` is updated accordingly. It holds true after the loop because the loop invariant is true for the final value of `i` which is `SIZE+1`.\n- The third invariant ensures that `sn` is not greater than `i*a`. This holds true because `i` is incremented by `1` in every iteration and `a` is added to `sn` only when `i` is a multiple of `4`. Thus, `sn` is always less than or equal to `i*a`.\n- The fourth invariant states that if `i-1` is a multiple of `4`, then `sn` is at least `a`. This holds true because `sn` is incremented by `a` only when `i-1` is a multiple of `4`.\n- The fifth invariant states that if `i` is a multiple of `4`, then `sn` is at most `(i/4)*a`. This holds true because `sn` is updated to `(i/4)*a` whenever `i` is a multiple of `4`.\n- The sixth invariant states that if `i` is not a multiple of `4`, then `sn` remains the same as its value in the previous iteration. This holds true because `sn` is not updated whenever `i` is not a multiple of `4`.\n- The seventh invariant states that if `i` is greater than `SIZE`, then the post-condition holds true. This holds true because the loop invariant ensures that `sn` is equal to `SIZE*a` or `0` for the final value of `i` which is `SIZE+1`."

Therefore, we can say that `sn` is equal to `a*(i-1)` if `i` is less than 4, and `sn` remains 0 otherwise. Hence, we have `sn = a*(i-1) || sn = 0`.\n- After the loop termination, if `i` is less than or equal to 3, then the value of `sn` would be `a*(i-1)` which is less than `a*3`.

We have only one statement inside the loop, which is an if statement. The if statement condition is `i<4` and if it evaluates to true, `sn` is incremented by `a`. We can see that `sn` is incremented by `a` only when `i` is less than 4.

It states that if `i` is greater than 4, then `sn` is equal to `3*a`.\n- The fourth loop invariant is true before and after the loop execution. It states that `sn` is either `0` or `3*a`.\n\nWe can verify that these loop invariants imply the post-condition:\n```\n//@ assert(sn==SIZE*a || sn == 0);\n```\nWhen the loop ends, `sn` will be equal to `3*a` or `0`.
