However, the loop is broken when y becomes negative.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can derive the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \nloop invariant 0 <= x <= N+1;\nloop invariant (y >= 0 && x <= N) || (y >= 1 && x >= N+1) || (y == 0 && x == N+1); \nloop invariant x == N+1 ==> y == -1;\nloop invariant y >= 0 ==> x >= y;\nloop invariant N >= 0 ==> x <= 2*N+2 ==> y >= 0;\nloop invariant N >= 0 ==> x == 2*N+3 ==> y == -1;\n*/\n```\nLet's explain each of the loop invariants:\n\n- The first loop invariant specifies that x is always between 0 and N+1 inclusive. This is because x is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop and the loop terminates when x > N+1.\n- The second loop invariant specifies that y is greater than or equal to 0 when x is less than or equal to N, y is greater than or equal to 1 when x is greater than or equal to N+1, and y is equal to 0 when x is equal to N+1. This is because y is incremented when x is less than or equal to N and decremented when x is greater than N. When x is equal to N+1, y must be 0 because no increment or decrement takes place.\n- The third loop invariant specifies that when x is equal to N+1, y must be -1. This is because the loop terminates only when y becomes negative and this is the only way y can become negative.\n- The fourth loop invariant specifies that if y is non-negative, then x must be greater than or equal to y. This is because y is incremented only when x is less than or equal to N and decremented only when x is greater than N. Therefore, x must be greater than or equal to y.\n- The fifth loop invariant specifies that if N is non-negative and x is less than or equal to 2*N+2, then y must be non-negative. This is because y is incremented when x is less than or equal to N, and decremented when x is greater than N+1. Therefore, if x is less than or equal to 2*N+2, then y must be non-negative. \n- The sixth loop invariant specifies that if N is non-negative and x is equal to 2*N+3, then y must be -1. This is because the loop terminates only when y becomes negative and this is the only way y can become negative. Therefore, if x is equal to 2*N+3, then y must be -1.\n\nFinally, we need to verify that the loop invariants imply the post-condition of the program. We can use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. For example, we can write the following implication for the assertion inside the ERROR label:\n```\n(x >= 2 * N + 3 && y == -1 && N >= 0) ==> \\false;\n```\nThis assertion is guarded by the condition (x >= 2 * N + 3 && y == -1 && N >= 0), which implies that if the condition is true, then the assertion must also be true.
