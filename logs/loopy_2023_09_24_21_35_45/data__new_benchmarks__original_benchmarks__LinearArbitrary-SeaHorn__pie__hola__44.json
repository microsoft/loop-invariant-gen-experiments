From the loop invariants, we know that `0 <= j <= (k + 1) * n` and `0 <= i <= k + 1`. Therefore, `0 <= j <= k + 1`. Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, after `k + 1` iterations, `j` must be equal to `k + 1`, which is also equal to `i`.\n- If `flag` is 0, then `n` is 2 and the post-condition does not apply.

Therefore, the loop invariants should reflect the changes to these variables. Since `i` starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 in each iteration, its maximum value is `k+1`. Similarly, since `j` starts at 0 and is incremented by `n` in each iteration, its maximum value is `n*i`. Also, the minimum values of `i` and `j` are 0 because they are initialized to 0.\n- After the loop terminates, the value of `i` is `k+1` because the loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. If `flag` is equal to 1, then `j` should be equal to `i`. Therefore, this condition is added to the loop invariant after the loop terminates."
