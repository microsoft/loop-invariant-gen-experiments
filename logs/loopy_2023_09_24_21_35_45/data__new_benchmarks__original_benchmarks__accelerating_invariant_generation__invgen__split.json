It is true in every iteration because `n` is incremented by 1. It is true after the loop termination because the loop terminates when `n` becomes equal to 2 times `k`.\n- `i+j` is even before the loop execution because `i` and `j` are both initialized to 0 and 0+0 is even. It is true in every iteration because if `b` is true, `i` is incremented by 1 and `j` remains the same, and if `b` is false, `j` is incremented by 1 and `i` remains the same, so the sum of `i` and `j` remains even. It is true after the loop termination because the loop terminates when `n` becomes equal to 2 times `k`, and since `i` and `j` are incremented alternatively in each iteration, their sum will be equal to `n` which is even.\n- `i+j <= n` is true before the loop execution because `i` and `j` are both initialized to 0 and `n` is initialized to 0, so their sum is less than or equal to `n`. It is true in every iteration because if `b` is true, `i` is incremented by 1 and `j` remains the same, and if `b` is false, `j` is incremented by 1 and `i` remains the same, so the sum of `i` and `j` remains less than or equal to `n` which is incremented by 1. It is true after the loop termination because the loop terminates when `n` becomes equal to 2 times `k`, and since `i` and `j` are incremented alternatively in each iteration, their sum will be equal to `n` which is less than or equal to 2 times `k`.\n- `i <= n/2 + k` is true before the loop execution because `i` is initialized to `j` which is 0, and `n` is initialized to 0, so `i` is less than or equal to `k`. It is true in every iteration because if `b` is true, `i` is incremented by 1, and if `b` is false, `i` remains the same, so `i` is always less than or equal to half of `n` plus `k`. It is true after the loop termination because the loop terminates when `n` becomes equal to 2 times `k`, and since `i` is incremented alternatively in each iteration, it will be less than or equal to half of `n` plus `k`.\n- `j <= n/2 + k` is true before the loop execution because `j` is initialized to `i` which is 0, and `n` is initialized to 0, so `j` is less than or equal to `k`. It is true in every iteration because if `b` is false, `j` is incremented by 1, and if `b` is true, `j` remains the same, so `j` is always less than or equal to half of `n` plus `k`. It is true after the loop termination because the loop terminates when `n` becomes equal to 2 times `k`, and since `j` is incremented alternatively in each iteration, it will be less than or equal to half of `n` plus `k`.\n\nUsing these loop invariants, we can prove that `i == j` after the loop termination. Because `i+j` is even and `i+j <= n`, `i` and `j` must have the same parity. Also, `i+j` is equal to `n` after the loop termination, so `"

Therefore, we can add the loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant j-i == \\at(n, LoopEntry) - \\at(n%2, LoopEntry);\n*/\n```\nThis invariant states that the difference between `j` and `i` is equal to the number of times the loop has executed so far, taking into account that `i` is incremented on even iterations and `j` is incremented on odd iterations.\n- We can also add the loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant n%2 == \\at(b, LoopEntry);\n*/\n```\nThis invariant states that `b` is always equal to the parity of `n`, meaning that `b` is true on even iterations and false on odd iterations.\n- Since we do not have any information about the initial values of `i` and `j`, we cannot prove that `i` will be equal to `j` at the end of the loop.

This means that after every iteration, the difference between `i` and `j` changes by `1`.\n- After `2*k` iterations, `n` will be equal to `2*k`.
