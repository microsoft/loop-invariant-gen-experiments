We will use this macro to specify pre-conditions.\n- The program includes two external functions: `unknown()` and `unknown_uint()`. We do not know anything about these functions, so we cannot assume anything about their behavior.\n- The program defines a constant `a` with the value 2.\n- The program declares three variables: `i`, `n`, and `sn`. The variable `n` is assigned a non-deterministic unsigned integer value using the function `unknown_uint()`. The variables `i` and `sn` are initialized to 1 and 0, respectively.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body:\n- The loop iterates from `i=1` to `i=n`.\n- Inside the loop, if `i` is less than 10, `sn` is incremented by `a` (which is 2).\n- After the loop, the assertion checks if `sn` is equal to `n*a` or 0.\n\nBased on this information, we can come up with the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \nloop invariant 1 <= i <= n+1;\nloop invariant sn == (\\sum integer j; 1 <= j < i ==> (j<10 ? a : 0));\nloop invariant sn <= i*a;\nloop invariant (n < 10 ==> sn == n*a);\nloop invariant (n >= 10 ==> sn == (\\floor(n/10)*10)*a);\n*/\n```\nLet's go over each invariant:\n- The first invariant specifies that `i` is always between 1 and `n+1`. This is a standard loop invariant for a loop that iterates over `i` from 1 to `n`.\n- The second invariant specifies that `sn` is equal to the sum of `a` for all `j` between 1 and `i-1` such that `j<10`, and 0 otherwise. This corresponds to the behavior of the loop body.\n- The third invariant specifies that `sn` is always less than or equal to `i*a`. This is true because `sn` is incremented by `a` at most once per iteration.\n- The fourth invariant specifies that if `n` is less than 10, then `sn` is equal to `n*a`. This is true because the loop body is never executed if `n` is less than 10.\n- The fifth invariant specifies that if `n` is greater than or equal to 10, then `sn` is equal to the floor of `n/10` times 10 times `a`. This is true because each time the loop body is executed, `sn` is incremented by `a` if `i` is less than 10. Therefore, `sn` is incremented by `a` exactly `floor(n/10)` times. Finally, `sn` is equal to `floor(n/10)*10*a` because the loop iterates from 1 to `n`, which means that the last iteration can only add `a` to `sn` if `n` is not a multiple of 10."

The value of `n` is obtained from an external function `unknown_uint()`.\n- The program initializes `sn` to 0.\n\nNext, let's analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition:\n\n- The loop condition is `i<=n`.\n- The loop body contains an `if` statement with the condition `i<10`.\n- If the condition is true, `sn` is updated by adding the constant `a` to it.\n\nThe post-condition of the program is `sn==n*a || sn == 0`.\n\nNow, let's find the necessary loop invariants:\n\n- Before the loop execution: Since `sn` is initialized to 0, the loop invariant `sn == 0` holds before the loop execution.\n- In every iteration of the loop: \n    - The loop invariant `1 <= i <= n+1` holds in every iteration of the loop, as `i` is initialized to 1 and incremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n+1`, at which point the loop terminates.\n    - The loop invariant `(i<=10 ==> sn == (i-1)*a) && (i>10 ==> sn == 9*a)` holds in every iteration of the loop. If `i` is less than or equal to 10, then the condition `i<10` in the loop body is true, and `sn` is updated by adding `a` to it. Therefore, `sn` is equal to `a` times the number of iterations (`i-1`) as long as `i` is less than or equal to 10. If `i` is greater than 10, then the condition `i<10` is false, and `sn` does not change anymore. Therefore, `sn` is equal to `9*a` if `i` is greater than 10.\n- After the loop termination: \n    - The loop invariant `(i>n ==> sn == n*a) && (i<=n ==> sn == (i-1)*a)` holds after the loop termination. If `i` is equal to `n+1`, then the loop terminates and `sn` is equal to `n*a` if all the previous iterations satisfied the loop invariant. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, then the loop terminates and `sn` is equal to `a` times the number of iterations (`i-1`) as long as all the previous iterations satisfied the loop invariant.\n\nPutting it all together, the loop invariants are:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant sn == 0;\n    loop invariant 1 <= i <= n+1;\n    loop invariant (i<=10 ==> sn == (i-1)*a) && (i>10 ==> sn == 9*a);\n    loop invariant (i>n ==> sn == n*a) && (i<=n ==> sn == (i-1)*a);\n*/\n``` \n\nNote that we have used the implication operator to handle the conditional nature of the program."

Therefore, the total value of `sn` at the end of the loop will be `(n-1)/10 * a`.\n- After the loop, we have:\n    - `sn = (n-1)/10 * a || sn = 0`: From the loop invariants, we know that `sn` will be `(n-1)/10 * a` if `n` is greater than or equal to 10. Otherwise, `sn` will be 0. This satisfies the post-condition."
