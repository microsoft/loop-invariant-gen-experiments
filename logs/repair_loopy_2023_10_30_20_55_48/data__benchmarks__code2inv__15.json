                    "First, we can see that the variable `n` is not initialized, which means it can contain any value (including negative values). However, the loop runs only when `x < n`, and `x` is initialized to 0, which means `n` should be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. So, we can introduce a loop invariant to capture this condition: `loop invariant n >= 0;`.\n\nSecond, the value of `x` increases by 1 in each iteration of the loop, so `x` will always be less than or equal to `n`.\n\nThird, `m` is only changed in the loop when `unknown()` returns a non-zero value. We don't know the behavior of this function, so we can't make any assertions about when `m` changes. However, when it does change, it's set to the current value of `x`, which means `m` is always less than or equal to `x`.\n\nFinally, the assertion `m < n` is partially proven. This is because `m` is always less than or equal to `x`, and `x` is always less than `n` during the loop, so `m` is also always less than `n`. We can strengthen this with the invariant `loop invariant m < n;`.\n\nThe loop invariants are:\n\n```c\n/*@ \n    loop invariant n >= 0;\n    loop invariant 0 <= x <= n;\n    loop invariant 0 <= m <= x;\n    loop invariant m < n;\n*/\n```\nThese invariants are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop and after the loop termination, and they are sufficient to prove the assertion `m < n`."
