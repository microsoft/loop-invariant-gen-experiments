                    "Before the loop, `x` is assigned the value of `n`. Thus, we do not have any guarantee that `x` is greater than or equal to `1` before the loop begins. This is why the invariant `x >= 1` is preserved but not established. We should remove this invariant because we don't have a guarantee about its initial value.\n\nThe invariant `x <= n` is partially proven to be inductive. This means that this invariant is inductive, but depends on another invariant that is not inductive. Since the only invariant that `x <= n` could depend on is `x >= 1`, which we have already removed, we can assume that `x <= n` is inductive.\n\nThe invariant `x >= 1 ==> x < n` is preserved but not established. This is because `x >= 1` is not guaranteed to hold before the loop begins. Thus, we should remove this invariant.\n\nThe invariant `x == 1 ==> n > 1` is partially proven to be inductive. This invariant is logically equivalent to `x != 1 || n > 1`. Since `x` is assigned the value of `n` before the loop, and `x` is decremented in every loop iteration, if `x == 1` after the loop, then `n` must have been greater than `1` before the loop. Thus, `x == 1 ==> n > 1` is inductive.\n\nThe invariant `n - x + 1 >= 0` is partially proven to be inductive. This invariant is logically equivalent to `n >= x - 1`. Since `x` is assigned the value of `n` before the loop, and `x` is decremented in every loop iteration, `n` is always greater than or equal to `x - 1`. Thus, `n - x + 1 >= 0` is inductive.\n\nThe assertion `n < 0` is partially proven. This assertion is true if and only if `x != 1` after the loop, because if `x == 1` after the loop, then `n` must have been greater than `1` before the loop. Thus, the assertion `n < 0` is equivalent to the loop invariant `x == 1 ==> n > 1`. \n\nWe can strengthen these invariants by adding an invariant that `x` decreases in each iteration of the loop.
