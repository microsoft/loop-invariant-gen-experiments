This continues until the loop condition is false.\n\nLooking at the Frama-C output, all the loop invariants are inductive. However, the assertion `z < 4608` is unproven. This assertion is only relevant if `c < 36` after the loop. \n\nLet's analyze the assertion: `z < 4608`. \nAt the start of the loop, `z = 36 * y`. Since `y >= 127` (as per the assumptions), the initial value of `z` is `36 * 127` which is `4572`. In each iteration of the loop, `z` is incremented by 1, so after `36` iterations, the value of `z` would be `4608`. But the assertion checks if `z` is less than `4608`.\n\nHence, we need to ensure that `z < 4608` when `c < 36`. For this, we can add a loop invariant that `z < 4608` when `c < 36`. This will ensure that the number of iterations is less than or equal to `36 - (4572 - 4608) = 72`, which is the maximum value that `c` can have for `z < 4608` to hold true.\n\nSo, the fixed invariants are:\n\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant i1: 0 <= c <= 36;\n  loop invariant i2: z == 36 * y + c;\n  loop invariant i3: z <= 36 * y + 36;\n  loop invariant i4: (c == 0 ==> z == 36 * y) && (c <= 36 ==> z <= 36 * y + 36);\n  loop invariant i5: (c < 36 ==> z < 4608);\n*/\n```"

                    "First, let's check the initial assignments and preconditions. The value of `c` is initialized to 0 and `y` is assumed to be greater than or equal to 127. `z` is initialized to `36*y`.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop condition and the loop body. The loop iterates indefinitely as there is no termination condition specified. Inside the loop, if `c` is less than 36, then `z` and `c` are incremented by 1.\n\nLooking at the invariants and the error messages, it seems that the first invariant `0 <= c <= 36` is partially inductive. This is not surprising as `c` is incremented in the loop and the condition `c < 36` is checked before incrementing `c`. Hence, the maximum value `c` can take is 36. \n\nThe second invariant `z == 36 * y + c` is partially inductive. `z` is initialized to `36*y` and incremented by 1 in each loop iteration. Similarly, `c` is incremented by 1 in each loop iteration. So, this invariant should hold.\n\nThe third invariant `z <= 36 * y + 36` is partially inductive. This should hold as `z` is always incremented by 1 and `c` is also incremented by 1 in each loop iteration.\n\nThe fourth invariant `(c == 0 ==> z == 36 * y) && (c <= 36 ==> z <= 36 * y + 36)` is partially inductive. The first part `(c == 0 ==> z == 36 * y)` is clearly inductive as it is established before the loop and preserved during the loop. The second part `(c <= 36 ==> z <= 36 * y + 36)` should also be inductive as `z` is always incremented by 1 and `c` is also incremented by 1 in each loop iteration.\n\nThe fifth invariant `(c < 36 ==> z < 4608)` is preserved but not established. This is because `z` could be more than 4608 before the loop starts, as `y` is assumed to be at least 127, `z` is initialized to `36*y` which is more than 4608 when `y >= 127`.\n\nThe assertion `(z < 4608)` is partially proven. This is because the fifth invariant is not established before the loop.\n\nTo fix the problem with the fifth invariant, we could remove the condition `c < 36 ==>` as it is not needed to establish the invariant.\n\nHere are the corrected loop invariants:\n\n```c\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= c <= 36;\n    loop invariant z == 36 * y + c;\n    loop invariant z <= 36 * y + 36;\n    loop invariant (c == 0 ==> z == 36 * y) && (c <= 36 ==> z <= 36 * y + 36);\n    loop invariant z < 4608;\n*/\n```\nThese invariants should be sufficient to verify the assertion in the program."

                    "The loop invariants specified are already inductive according to the output from Frama-C. However, there is an unproven assertion after the loop that states `(z < 4608)`. This assertion is not directly related to our loop invariants, hence it cannot be proven with the current invariants. \n\nLet's analyze this. The value of `z` is initially set to `36*y` and inside the loop it is incremented by 1 in each iteration. The loop continues as long as the function `unknown()` returns true and `c < 36`. This means that the maximum number of increments that `z` could get is 36 (the same as `c`), making the maximum possible value of `z` to be `36*y + 36`. \n\nFrom the pre-conditions, we know that `y >= 127`. Therefore, the minimum value of `z` at the end of the loop is `36*127 + 36 = 4608`, which is not less than 4608, contradicting our assertion `(z < 4608)`.\n\nSince our loop invariants are correct according to Frama-C and the unproven assertion seems to contradict our pre-conditions and the logic of the program, we might think that the assertion is incorrect rather than the loop invariants. However, we are asked to provide invariants that can prove the assertions, so let's try to add an additional invariant that can help prove the assertion.\n\nWe can add an invariant `loop invariant i5: z < 4608;` to try to prove the assertion, but this invariant will not be inductive because it contradicts the logic of the program as explained above. So, the loop invariants can't be modified to prove the assertion `(z < 4608)` because the assertion is incorrect given the pre-conditions and the logic of the program.\n\nSo, the loop invariants remain the same:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1: 0 <= c <= 36;\n    loop invariant i2: z == 36 * y + c;\n    loop invariant i3: z <= 36 * y + 36;\n    loop invariant i4: (c == 0 ==> z == 36 * y) && (c <= 36 ==> z <= 36 * y + 36);\n*/\n```"
