Invariant i3 is preserved but not established, meaning it does not hold before the loop.\n\nWe can fix invariant i3 by adding a clause that ensures it holds before the loop.

Considering the initialization of `i` and `sn`, `sn` does not equal `i-1` at the start of the loop. Instead, `sn` equals `i-1` at the end of each loop iteration. We can modify this invariant to reflect this.\n\nThe corrected loop invariants are:\n\n```c\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1: 0 <= i;\n    loop invariant i2: 0 <= sn;\n    loop invariant i3: n >= 0 ==> i <= n+1;\n    loop invariant i4: \\at(sn, LoopEntry) == \\at(i, LoopEntry)-1;\n*/\n```\n\nIn this correction, the LoopEntry keyword is used to refer to the state of the variable at the start of the loop.

This suggests that the loop invariants are not sufficient to prove this assertion. \n\nThe invariant `i3: n >= 0 ==> i <= n+1` guarantees that `i` never exceeds `n+1`, but it doesn't directly relate `sn` and `n`. \n\nSimilarly, the invariant `i4: \\at(sn, LoopEntry) == \\at(i, LoopEntry)-1` establishes a relationship between `sn` and `i` at the start of the loop, but it doesn't directly relate `sn` and `n`.\n\nTo prove the assertion `sn == n`, we need an invariant that directly relates `sn` and `n`. Since both `sn` and `i` are incremented by the same amount in each iteration, `sn` should always be equal to `i - 1`. \n\nThis leads us to a new loop invariant `i5: sn == i - 1`. This invariant is true before the loop (since `sn = 0` and `i = 1`), and is preserved by each loop iteration (since both `sn` and `i` are incremented by 1). \n\nThen, after the loop termination (when `i > n`), `sn` should be equal to `n` (since `i - 1 = n`), which proves the assertion.\n\nHere is the corrected loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1: 0 <= i;\n    loop invariant i2: 0 <= sn;\n    loop invariant i3: n >= 0 ==> i <= n+1;\n    loop invariant i4: \\at(sn, LoopEntry) == \\at(i, LoopEntry)-1;\n    loop invariant i5: sn == i - 1;\n*/\n```\nThese invariants are sufficient to prove all the assertions in the program."

So, we need to add loop invariant(s) that can help in proving this assertion.\n\nLooking at the loop body, we see that both `sn` and `i` are incremented in every iteration. The loop continues until `i` is no longer less than or equal to `n`. If we look at the existing loop invariant `sn == i - 1`, it suggests that at every step, `sn` will be one less than `i`. Hence, when the loop ends, `sn` should be one less than the final value of `i`. \n\nSince the loop stops when `i` becomes greater than `n`, `i` should be `n+1` at the end of the loop. So, `sn` should be `n` at the end of the loop, which is our assertion.\n\nTherefore, we do not need to modify any existing loop invariant. We just need to add a new one to prove the assertion.
