The variable `n` is not initialized, and thus we can't make any assumptions about its value.\n\nNext, we analyze the loop body. The loop condition is `x < n` and in each iteration of the loop, `x` is incremented by `1`.\n\nNow let's consider the invariants and the error messages:\n\n1. `x >= 0` is partially proven to be inductive. This invariant is correct as `x` is initialized to `0` and incremented in each iteration. It should be preserved and established.\n\n2. `x <= n` is preserved but not established. This means that the invariant holds after the loop, assuming it holds before the loop. But it does not hold before the loop. This is because we don't know the initial value of `n`. We can't fix this invariant as we don't know `n`'s initial value.\n\n3. `(n < 0) ==> (x == 0)` is partially proven to be inductive. This is because if `n` is less than `0`, the loop will not execute and `x` will remain `0`. This invariant should be preserved and established.\n\n4. `0 <= x` is partially proven to be inductive. This is same as invariant `x >= 0` and should be preserved and established.\n\n5. `x <= n ==> x == 0` is established but not preserved. This is because before the loop starts, `x` is indeed `0`. But during the loop, `x` is incremented and thus `x` becomes not equal to `0`. Therefore, this invariant is not correct and should be removed.\n\n6. `x <= n ==> x < n` is preserved but not established. This invariant does not hold before the loop starts. This is because we don't know the initial value of `n`.\n\nThe assertion is `x == n`. This means after the loop, `x` should be equal to `n`. To ensure this, `x` must start from `0` and increment in each iteration until it becomes equal to `n`.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct loop invariants that are both established and preserved would be:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant (n < 0) ==> (x == 0);\n    loop invariant 0 <= x;\n*/\n```\nThese invariants ensure that `x` starts from `0` and is incremented in each iteration of the loop. If `n` is less than `0`, the loop will not execute and `x` will remain `0`. These invariants help in proving the assertion `x == n`."

                    "- The variable 'x' is initialized to 0 before the loop. So, the invariants 'x >= 0' and '0 <= x' are established before the loop. In each iteration of the loop, 'x' is incremented by 1, so 'x' remains greater or equal to 0. Therefore, these invariants are preserved after each loop iteration. Hence, these invariants are inductive.\n\n- The invariant '(n < 0) ==> (x == 0)' means that if 'n' is less than 0, then 'x' is 0. This is established before the loop because 'x' is initialized to 0 before the loop. However, this invariant is not preserved after each loop iteration because 'x' is incremented in each iteration. This invariant is not necessary for proving the assertion 'x == n'. So, we can remove this invariant.\n\n- The invariant 'x <= n' means that 'x' is less than or equal to 'n'. Before the loop, 'x' is 0, and 'n' is not initialized, so it could have a garbage value. Therefore, the invariant 'x <= n' is not established before the loop. To fix this, we add the clause 'n >= \\at(x, LoopEntry)' to the invariant. Now, the invariant 'x <= n && n >= \\at(x, LoopEntry)' is established before the loop. In each iteration, 'x' is incremented by 1, so 'x' remains less than or equal to 'n'. Therefore, this invariant is preserved after each loop iteration. Hence, this invariant is inductive.\n\n- The assertion 'x == n' is partially proven. This assertion means that 'x' is equal to 'n'. This holds after the loop termination if 'n' is greater or equal to 0.

Thus, `x` will always be greater than or equal to 0 before, during, and after the loop execution. According to Frama-C, this invariant is partially proven to be inductive, which means it is inductive but depends on other non-inductive invariants.\n\n- `x <= n && n == \\at(n, LoopEntry)`: This invariant is not established. This is because `n` can be any value (including negative numbers) as `n` is not initialized in the code. However, the invariant is preserved, which means once the loop starts, `n` doesn't change and `x` is always less than or equal to `n`.\n\nTo establish the second invariant, we need to add a precondition that `n` is non-negative.
