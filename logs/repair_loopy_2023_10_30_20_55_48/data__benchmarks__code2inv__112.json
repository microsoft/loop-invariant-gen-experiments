This means that at any point during the loop, `sn` is always `i - 1`.

This assertion can be true only if the loop does not execute. And the loop does not execute when `n` is less than `1` because `i` is initialized as `1`.\n\nSo, there is a relationship between `sn` and `n` that has to be captured in a loop invariant. More specifically, the value of `sn` is equal to `i - 1` at every iteration and at the end of the loop.\n\nLet's add this invariant: `sn == i - 1`.\n\nHere is the fixed code block with the loop invariants:\n\n```c\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i == 1 || (1 < i && i <= n + 1);\n    loop invariant sn == i - 1;\n*/\n```"
