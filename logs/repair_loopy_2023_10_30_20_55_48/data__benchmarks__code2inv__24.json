                    "The invariants `i1`, `i2`, `i3`, `i4`, `i5`, `i6`, `i7`, `i8`, `i9` are partially proven to be inductive. That means they are inductive, but the invariance depends on another invariant which is not inductive.\n\nThe invariant `i10` is preserved but not established, meaning it holds after the loop but not before the loop starts.\n\nLooking at the loop body, the `i` is always incremented by `2` and `j` is always decremented by `1`. This can help us identify the correct invariants:\n\n- For `i1`, the invariant `i % 2 == 1` is correct because `i` is initially `1` and it's always incremented by `2`. So `i` is always an odd number.\n- For `i2`, the invariant `j % 2 == 0` is incorrect because `j` is initially `10` and it's always decremented by `1`, so it's not always an even number. We should remove this invariant.\n- For `i3`, the invariant `1 <= i` is correct because `i` is initially `1` and it's always incremented.\n- For `i4`, the invariant `i <= 11` is correct because `i` is initially `1` and it's always incremented by `2`, but it will never exceed `11` due to the loop condition `j >= i`.\n- For `i5`, the invariant `6 <= j` is correct because `j` is initially `10` and it's always decremented by `1`, but it will never be less than `6` due to the loop condition `j >= i` and the initial value of `i`.\n- For `i6`, the invariant `j >= i` is correct because it's the loop condition itself.\n- For `i7`, the invariant `i <= j + 1` is correct because `i` is always incremented by `2` and `j` is always decremented by `1`, so `i` will always be less than or equal to `j + 1`.\n- For `i8`, we can remove this invariant because it's the same as `i5`.\n- For `i9`, the invariant `6 <= j + i` is incorrect because `j + i` is not always greater than or equal to `6`. We should remove this invariant.\n- For `i10`, the invariant `(j - i) % 3 == 1 && i % 2 == 1 && j % 2 == 0` is incorrect because it does not hold before the loop starts. We should remove this invariant.\n\nConsidering the above, the corrected loop invariants are:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i % 2 == 1;\n    loop invariant 1 <= i;\n    loop invariant i <= 11;\n    loop invariant 6 <= j;\n    loop invariant j >= i;\n    loop invariant i <= j + 1;\n*/\n```\nThese invariants are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop and after the loop termination, and can be used to prove the assertion `(j == 6)`."

But some of the other invariants are not inductive.\nIf an invariant is established, it means that the verifier is able to prove that the invariant holds before the loop.\nIf an invariant is preserved, it means that the verifier is able to prove that the invariant holds after the loop, assuming that it holds before the loop.\n\nTo fix the non-inductive invariants, try the following:\nIf an invariant is partially proven to be inductive, make sure it is actually inductive. If it is not, remove it or replace it with a different inductive invariant. If it is, then fix the other non-inductive invariants.\nIf an invariant is preserved but not established, add a clause to the invariant to make it established (a clause that makes the invariant hold before the loop begins).\nIf an invariant is established but not preserved, add a clause to the invariant to make it preserved (a clause that makes the invariant hold after the loop ends, assuming that it holds before the loop begins).\nIf an invariant is neither established nor preserved, remove it or replace it with a different inductive invariant.\n\nIf none of the above is possible, add a new loop invariant to strengthen the existing invariants.\n\nPlease fix all the above-mentioned errors, and provide the corrected loop invariants for the program that are sufficient to verify the assertions in the program.\nUse the ACSL syntax to specify the invariants. Output only one code block in the end, with the fixed invariants. **Do not output any other code blocks**.\nLet's think step by step."
