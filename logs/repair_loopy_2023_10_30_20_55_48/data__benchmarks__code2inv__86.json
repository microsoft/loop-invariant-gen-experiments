                    "The preconditions or variable assignments in the program are: `x = -50`. The loop condition is `x < 0`. The loop body increments `x` by `y` and increments `y` by `1`.\n\nThe loop invariant `i1: y >= \\at(y, LoopEntry)` is partially proven to be inductive. This invariant is not inductive, because `y` is incremented in the loop body, which means that `y` is not guaranteed to be greater than or equal to its initial value in every iteration of the loop. Thus, we should remove this invariant.\n\nThe loop invariant `i2: x >= \\at(x, LoopEntry)` is also partially proven to be inductive. This invariant is also not inductive, because `x` is incremented in the loop body, which means that `x` can be greater than its initial value in some iteration of the loop. Thus, we should remove this invariant as well.\n\nThe loop invariant `i3: y > 0` is preserved but not established. This invariant is not established, because `y` is not initialized before the loop, and thus, it can contain a garbage value that is not greater than `0`. We should initialize `y` before the loop and add an invariant that `y` is greater than or equal to its initial value.\n\nThe assertion `y > 0` is partially proven. This assertion is not proven, because `y` is not initialized and thus, it can contain a garbage value that is not greater than `0`. We should initialize `y` before the loop to ensure that this assertion holds.\n\nThus, the corrected loop invariants for the program are:\n\n```\n(y = 1);\n/*@\nloop invariant y >= 1;\n*/\nwhile ((x < 0)) {\n    {\n    (x  = (x + y));\n    (y  = (y + 1));\n    }\n\n  }\n  \n{;\n//@ assert( (y > 0) );\n}\n```"
