This is because the loop initialization sets `i` to 1 and within the loop, `i` is only incremented. Therefore, `i` will always be greater than or equal to 1. However, this invariant depends on the invariant `i <= n + 1`, which is not established. Therefore, we need to fix the other non-inductive invariants.\n\n- The loop invariant `0 <= sn` is partially proven to be inductive. This is because `sn` is initialized to 0 and within the loop, `sn` is only incremented. Therefore, `sn` will always be greater than or equal to 0. However, this invariant depends on the invariant `sn == i - 1`, which is not established. Therefore, we need to fix the other non-inductive invariants.\n\n- The loop invariant `sn == i - 1` is partially proven to be inductive. This invariant is true at the beginning of the loop because `sn` is initialized to 0 and `i` is initialized to 1. Within the loop, `sn` and `i` are incremented at the same time, so `sn` will always be `i - 1`. However, this invariant depends on the invariants `1 <= i`, `0 <= sn`, and `i <= n + 1`, which are not all established or preserved. Therefore, we need to fix the other non-inductive invariants.\n\n- The loop invariant `sn == i - 1 && i <= n + 1` is preserved but not established. This invariant is a conjunction of `sn == i - 1` and `i <= n + 1`. The first part `sn == i - 1` is already analyzed. The second part `i <= n + 1` is not established because we don't have a precondition that ensures `i <= n + 1` before the loop begins. We need to add such a precondition.\n\nSo, the corrected loop invariants would be:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 1 <= i;\n    loop invariant 0 <= sn;\n    loop invariant sn == i - 1;\n    loop invariant i <= n + 1;\n    loop assigns i, sn;\n*/\n```\n\nThese invariants are sufficient to verify the assertion `sn == n` at the end of the program, because `sn` is incremented in the same way as `i` and `i` goes from 1 to `n`, so `sn` will be equal to `n` at the end of the loop."
