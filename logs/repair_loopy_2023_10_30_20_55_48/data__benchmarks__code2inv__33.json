Because of this, invariants `i1`, `i2`, `i3`, `i4` and `i5` can't be established. To fix this, we must add pre-conditions to ensure that `n` and `x` are non-negative before the loop starts.\n\nThe loop invariant `i1` is not preserved because the value of `x` changes in each iteration of the loop, but the invariant states that `x` should be equal to the value of `n` at the beginning of the loop.

This means that they are preserved in each iteration of the loop, but they are not established before the loop starts because `n` and `x` are not initialized. We must add pre-conditions to ensure that `n` and `x` are non-negative before the loop starts.\n\nThe assertion `n < 0` is partially proven. This means that it can be proven to be true if the loop invariants are true. The loop invariant `i4` states that `n - x >= 0`. Since `x` is decremented in each iteration of the loop and the loop continues as long as `x > 0`, `x` will be `0` when the loop ends. This means that `n - x` will be equal to `n` when the loop ends. So, if `n - x >= 0` is true, then `n >= 0` must also be true. This contradicts the assertion `n < 0`.

Here, it is seen that `x` is assigned the value of `n`.\n\nNext, we analyze the loop body and note the loop condition. The loop condition here is `x > 0`. Inside the loop, `x` is decremented by 1 in each iteration.\n\nLooking at the loop invariants, we can see that the first two invariants `i1: x >= 0` and `i2: x <= n` are likely to hold true since `x` is initially set to `n` and is decremented in each loop iteration. Thus, `x` will always be less than or equal to `n` and greater than or equal to 0 (within the loop).\n\nThe third invariant `i3: x == n - iteration_count` has a syntax error. The variable `iteration_count` is not defined anywhere in the program, hence Frama-C returns a syntax error message. However, the invariant seems to express the correct logic: `x` is initially `n` and is decremented once per loop iteration, so after `i` iterations, `x` should be `n - i`. \n\nTo fix the syntax error, we could replace `iteration_count` with a proper ACSL construct to represent the number of iterations. The construct `\\at(x, LoopEntry) - x` can be used to represent the number of iterations since `x` is decremented by 1 in each iteration. \n\nTherefore, the corrected loop invariants should be as follows:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant x <= n;\n    loop invariant x == n - (\\at(x, LoopEntry) - x);\n*/\n```"
