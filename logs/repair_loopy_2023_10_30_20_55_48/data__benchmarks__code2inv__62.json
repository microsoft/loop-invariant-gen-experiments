We should state that \"0 <= c <= n || c == 1\".\n\nThe second invariant, \"c == \\at(c, LoopEntry) || c == \\at(c, LoopEntry) + 1 || c == 1\", is also established, but not preserved. The problem with this invariant is that it does not account for the fact that c can also become n + 1. We should adjust it to \"c == \\at(c, LoopEntry) || c == \\at(c, LoopEntry) + 1 || c == 1 || c == n + 1\".\n\nFinally, we can fix the assertion \"c != n\" by adding a loop invariant that states that \"c != n\" is true at every iteration of the loop. \n\nHere are the corrected loop invariants:\n\n```c\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= c <= n || c == 1;\n    loop invariant c == \\at(c, LoopEntry) || c == \\at(c, LoopEntry) + 1 || c == 1 || c == n + 1;\n    loop invariant c != n;\n*/\n```"
