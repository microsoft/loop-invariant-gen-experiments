If it is not, remove it or replace it with a different inductive invariant. If it is, then fix the other non-inductive invariants.\nIf an invariant is preserved but not established, add a clause to the invariant to make it established (a clause that makes the invariant hold before the loop begins).\nIf an invariant is established but not preserved, add a clause to the invariant to make it preserved (a clause that makes the invariant hold after the loop ends, assuming that it holds before the loop begins).\nIf an invariant is neither established nor preserved, remove it or replace it with a different inductive invariant.\n\nIf none of the above is possible, add a new loop invariant to strengthen the existing invariants.\n\nPlease fix all the above-mentioned errors, and provide the corrected loop invariants for the program that are sufficient to verify the assertions in the program.\nUse the ACSL syntax to specify the invariants.

                    "The loop invariant `k >= 0` is partially proven to be inductive. Since k is initialized to 0 before the loop and only increases within the loop, this invariant should be inductive. We can keep it as it is.\n\nThe loop invariant `k <= 1` is partially proven to be inductive. This should be inductive as well, because k increments by 1 in each iteration and the loop condition is `k < 1`.\n\nThe loop invariant `m >= a` is partially proven to be inductive. This invariant is true before the loop because of the assume statement `assume(a <= m);` and it is preserved in the loop body where m is updated to be at least as large as a.\n\nThe loop invariant `(k == 0) ==> (m == \\at(m, LoopEntry))` is partially proven to be inductive. This invariant is valid because when k is 0, the loop has not executed yet, so m is still its original value. \n\nThe loop invariant `k == 0 ==> a <= m` is partially proven to be inductive. This invariant is valid because when k is 0, the loop has not executed yet, so the assumption `assume(a <= m);` still holds.\n\nThe loop invariant `a <= m` is partially proven to be inductive. This invariant is valid because m is updated to be at least as large as a in the loop body, so `a <= m` should always hold.\n\nThe loop invariant `k == 1 ==> a >= \\at(m, LoopEntry)` is established but not preserved. This is because when k is 1, the loop has executed once and m might have been updated to a larger value. This invariant needs to be fixed.\n\nFinally, the assertion `a >= m` is unproven. This is because the loop does not guarantee `a >= m`. After the loop, m is at least as large as a, but not necessarily smaller. We need to adjust the logic or add loop invariants to show that `a >= m` holds after the loop. \n\nAfter analyzing all the loop invariants, we can make the following changes:\n\n- The invariant `k == 1 ==> a >= \\at(m, LoopEntry)` should be changed to `k == 1 ==> a >= m`, because after the loop execution, a is either equal or greater than m.\n\nHere are the fixed loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant k >= 0;\n    loop invariant k <= 1;\n    loop invariant m >= a;\n    loop invariant (k == 0) ==> (m == \\at(m, LoopEntry));\n    loop invariant k == 0 ==> a <= m;\n    loop invariant a <= m;\n    loop invariant k == 1 ==> a >= m;\n*/\n```"
