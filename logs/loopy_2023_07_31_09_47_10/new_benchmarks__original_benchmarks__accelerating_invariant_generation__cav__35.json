Before the loop execution: `x` is initialized to 0, so both the first two invariants hold. The third invariant is trivially true since `x < n` when `n > 0`.\n2. In every iteration of the loop: As `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, the first two invariants continue to hold. The third invariant is also true because `x` will be less than `n` or eventually equal to `n` if `n > 0`.\n3. After the loop termination: The loop terminates when `x > n-1`, which implies that `x >= n`. The first two invariants are still true. The third invariant is also true since, after the loop termination, `x == n` when `n > 0`. This helps Frama-C verify the post-condition `if (x < n) return;` and `if (n >= 1 && (x <= n-1 || x >= n+1)) {goto ERROR; ERROR:;}`."
