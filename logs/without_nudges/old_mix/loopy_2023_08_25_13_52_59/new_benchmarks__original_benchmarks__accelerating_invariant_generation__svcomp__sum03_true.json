Since `loop1` is an unknown unsigned integer, it acts as an upper bound for `x`.\n3. `sn == x * a`: This invariant states that `sn` is always equal to `x` multiplied by the constant `a` (2). This is true because `sn` is incremented by `a` in each iteration, while `x` is incremented by 1. Therefore, their relationship remains constant throughout the loop.\n\nThe given loop invariants imply the post-condition `sn == x * a || sn == 0`.
