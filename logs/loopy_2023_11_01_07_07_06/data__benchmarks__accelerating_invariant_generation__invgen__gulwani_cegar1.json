If these conditions are met, then the program asserts that `x` is less than 4.\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition:\n\n- The loop condition is `__BLAST_NONDET`, which is a non-deterministic boolean value.\n\nNext, let's output the necessary loop invariants:\n\n- Before the loop execution, we have the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= x <= 2;\n    loop invariant 0 <= y <= 2;\n*/\n```\n- In every iteration of the loop, the loop invariants must hold. Since the loop only increments `x` and `y` by 2, we can add the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x % 2 == 0;\n    loop invariant y % 2 == 0;\n*/\n```\n- After the loop termination, we have the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant y < 0 ==> x < 4;\n*/\n```\nThe last loop invariant is derived from the assertion in the program.
