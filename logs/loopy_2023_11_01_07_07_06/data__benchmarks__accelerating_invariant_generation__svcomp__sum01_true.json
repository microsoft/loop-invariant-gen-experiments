The loop body simply adds `a` to `sn` in each iteration. The loop condition is `i <= n`. \n\nTo verify the post-condition `sn==n*a || sn == 0`, we can use the following loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 1 <= i <= n+1;\n    loop invariant sn == (i-1)*a;\n    loop invariant sn <= n*a;\n    loop invariant sn >= 0;\n*/\n```\n\nExplanation of loop invariants:\n- `1 <= i <= n+1` - this invariant ensures that `i` starts from 1 and increases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n+1`. This is necessary to ensure that we add `a` to `sn` exactly `n` times.\n- `sn == (i-1)*a` - this invariant ensures that `sn` is always equal to the sum of `a` added `i-1` times. This is true before the loop starts because `i-1` is 0 and `sn` is 0. In each iteration, we add `a` to `sn`, thus making this invariant true for every iteration. After the loop terminates, `i` is equal to `n+1`, hence `sn` will be equal to `n*a`, which satisfies the post-condition.\n- `sn <= n*a` - this invariant ensures that `sn` does not exceed `n*a`. This is true before the loop starts because `sn` is 0 and `n*a` is non-negative. In each iteration, we add `a` to `sn`, thus making this invariant true for every iteration. After the loop terminates, `sn` can be equal to `n*a` if `i` is equal to `n+1`, which satisfies the post-condition.\n- `sn >= 0` - this invariant ensures that `sn` is non-negative. This is true before the loop starts because `sn` is 0. In each iteration, we add `a` to `sn`, which is non-negative, thus making this invariant true for every iteration. After the loop terminates, `sn` can be equal to 0 if `i` is equal to 1, which satisfies the post-condition.\n\nNote that `unknown_int()` is a non-deterministic function that returns an arbitrary integer value. We cannot make any assumptions about the value of `n` other than it is non-negative. However, since we have bounded `sn` between 0 and `n*a`, the loop invariants will hold for any non-negative value of `n`.",
            "Pre-conditions and variable assignments:\n\n- The macro `assume` takes a boolean expression, and if it evaluates to false, the program returns 0.\n- The `unknown_int` function returns an integer whose value is unknown at the start of the program.\n- The macro `a` is defined as 2.\n- The variable `i` is declared as an integer.\n- The variable `n` is assigned the return value of `unknown_int()`.\n- The variable `sn` is assigned 0.\n\n\nLoop condition: The loop iterates while `i` is less than or equal to `n`.\n\nLoop invariants:\n\n- Before the loop: none needed.\n- During the loop: \n\n    - `1 <= i <= n+1`: This holds at the start of each iteration. Since the loop condition is `i<=n` and `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, `i` can take values from 1 to `n+1`. \n    - `sn == (i-1) * a`: This holds at the start of each iteration. Initially, `sn` is 0, and in each iteration, `sn` is incremented by `a`, so at the start of the `i`-th iteration, `sn` is equal to `(i-1)*a`.\n    - `sn <= n*a`: This holds at the start of each iteration. Since `sn` is incremented by `a` in each iteration, its maximum value is `n*a`.\n    \n- After the loop: \n\n    - `i == n+1`: This holds after the loop terminates.

This is true for all iterations except the last one, where `i` becomes equal to `n+1`. \n- The last loop invariant is an implication that makes the invariant true when `n` is non-deterministic at the beginning or end of the loop.

Therefore, `sn` is equal to its previous value plus `a`, which is equal to `(i-1)*a`. The conjunction `sn == (i-1)*a && n >= i-1` is true because `sn` is equal to `(i-1)*a` and `n` is greater than or equal to `i-1` since the loop condition is true.\n3.
