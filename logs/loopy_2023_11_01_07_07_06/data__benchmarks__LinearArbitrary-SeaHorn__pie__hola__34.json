The input to Frama-C is a C program file with ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations.\nFor the given program, find the necessary loop invariants of the while loop to help Frama-C verify the post-condition.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. \n- Output loop invariants that are true \n(i) before the loop execution, \n(ii) in every iteration of the loop and \n(iii) after the loop termination, \nsuch that the loop invariants imply the post condition.\n- If a loop invariant is a conjunction, split it into its parts.\n- Output all the loop invariants in one code block. For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values.

When `i` is even, `y` is incremented, so `y` is always less than or equal to `i/2`.\n- After the loop terminates, `i` is equal to `n+1`, since the loop condition is false at that point. `x` is equal to `n+1-y`, since `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration. `y` can be at most `n/2`, since it is incremented only when `i` is even.\n- If `n` is less than 0, the loop is not executed, so `x` and `y` remain 0.
