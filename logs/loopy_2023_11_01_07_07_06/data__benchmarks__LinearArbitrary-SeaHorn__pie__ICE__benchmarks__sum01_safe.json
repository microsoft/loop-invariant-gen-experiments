            "First, let's note the pre-condition and variable assignments:\n- The program does not have any explicit pre-condition.\n- Variable `n` is assigned the value returned by the function `unknown_int()`.\n- Variable `i` is assigned the value `1`.\n- Variable `sn` is assigned the value `0`.\n\nNext, let's analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition:\n- The loop condition is `i<=n`.\n- The loop body increments the value of `sn` by `1`.\n\nBased on the post-condition, we can derive the necessary loop invariants as follows:\n- Before the loop execution:\n    - `sn == 0`\n    - `n >= 0`\n\n- In every iteration of the loop:\n    - `1 <= i <= n+1`\n    - `0 <= sn <= i-1`\n    - `sn+i-1 == \\sum_{j=1}^{i-1} 1`\n\n- After the loop termination:\n    - `sn == n || sn == 0`\n\nExplanation:\n- Before the loop execution:\n    - Since `sn` is assigned the value `0` before the loop execution, it must be equal to `0`.\n    - Since `n` is assigned the value returned by the function `unknown_int()`, we cannot make any assumptions about its value except that it is greater than or equal to `0`.\n- In every iteration of the loop:\n    - `i` is always greater than or equal to `1` and less than or equal to `n+1`.\n    - `sn` is always greater than or equal to `0` and less than or equal to `i-1`. This is because `sn` is incremented by `1` in every iteration, and `i` starts from `1`.\n    - The sum of the first `i-1` positive integers is given by the formula `\\sum_{j=1}^{i-1} j = (i-1)*i/2`. Therefore, `sn+i-1` must be equal to `1+2+...+(i-1)+i-1 = (i-1)*i/2 + (i-1) = (i-1)*(i+1)/2`.\n- After the loop termination:\n    - `sn` must be equal to `n` if the loop executed `n` times (i.e., if the loop condition was true `n` times), and `0` otherwise.\n\nTherefore, the final set of loop invariants is:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant sn == 0;\n    loop invariant n >= 0;\n    loop invariant 1 <= i <= n+1;\n    loop invariant 0 <= sn <= i-1;\n    loop invariant sn+i-1 == (i-1)*(i+1)/2;\n    loop invariant sn == n || sn == 0;\n*/\n```",

Therefore, `sn == i - 1`.\n- After the loop termination, the value of `sn` should be equal to `n` because the loop iterates `n` times and increments `sn` by 1 in each iteration.

Therefore, `sn == n || sn == 0`.\n\nPutting it all together:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant sn == 0 ==> i == 1;\n    loop invariant 1 <= i <= n+1;\n    loop invariant sn == i - 1;\n    loop invariant sn == n || sn == 0;\n*/\n```",

So, the following invariant holds:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant sn == 0; */\n```\n- In every iteration of the loop, the variable i increases by 1 and sn also increases by 1. Thus, the following invariant holds:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant 1 <= i <= n+1 && sn == i-1; */\n```\n- After the loop termination, sn should be equal to n or 0.
