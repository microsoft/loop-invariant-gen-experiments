This invariant can be derived by noticing that in each iteration of the loop, one of `a` and `b` is incremented by 1, and the other is incremented by either 1 or 2, depending on the outcome of `unknown_int()`. Therefore, the sum of `a` and `b` can be expressed as `(2*i + 1)*min(a,b) + (2*n - 2*i - 1)*max(a,b)`.\n- The fifth invariant states that if `i` is less than `n`, then the sum of `a` and `b` can be expressed as `3*i + 1`. This follows from the fact that in each iteration of the loop, the total number of increments to `a` and `b` is 3.\n- The sixth invariant states that if `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, then the sum of `a` and `b` is equal to `3*n`. This follows from the fact that the loop terminates when `i` becomes equal to `n`, and the value of `a+b` at that point is `3*n`. \n\nAll of these loop invariants hold true before, during, and after the execution of the loop, and they imply the post-condition that `a+b = 3*n`. Therefore, they can be used to help Frama-C verify the post-condition. \n\nOutput:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= i <= n;\n    loop invariant 0 <= a <= 2*n;\n    loop invariant 0 <= b <= 2*n;\n    loop invariant (a + b) == (2*i + 1)*min(a,b) + (2*n - 2*i - 1)*max(a,b);\n    loop invariant (i < n) ==> (a + b == 3*i + 1);\n    loop invariant (i >= n) ==> (a + b == 3*n);\n*/\n```",

Therefore, `i` is always less than or equal to `n`.\n- `0 <= a <= 2*n` and `0 <= b <= 2*n`: `a` and `b` start at 0 and increment by either 1 or 2 in each iteration of the loop. Therefore, `a` and `b` are always less than or equal to `2*n`.\n- `(a + b) % 3 == 0`: The sum of `a` and `b` increments by either 3 or 1 in each iteration of the loop, depending on the value returned by `unknown_int()`. Therefore, the sum of `a` and `b` is always divisible by 3.\n- `(a + b) <= 3*n`: The maximum value of the sum of `a` and `b` is reached when `unknown_int()` returns `1` in every iteration of the loop. In this case, `a` increments by 1 and `b` increments by 2, leading to a total increment of 3 in each iteration. Therefore, the maximum value of the sum of `a` and `b` is `3*n`.\n- `(i < n) ==> ((a + b) == (3*i + 3))`: This invariant holds for all iterations of the loop except the last one. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop has not yet reached its last iteration, and the sum of `a` and `b` is equal to `3*i + 3`. The extra `3` comes from the increment of `a` and `b` in the current iteration of the loop.\n- `(i == n) ==> ((a + b) == (3*n))`: This invariant holds only for the last iteration of the loop, when `i` becomes equal to `n`. At this point, the sum of `a` and `b` must be equal to `3*n`, which is the post-condition of the program.",
