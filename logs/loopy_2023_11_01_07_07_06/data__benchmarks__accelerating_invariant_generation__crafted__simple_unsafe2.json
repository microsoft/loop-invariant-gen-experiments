Since `x` is uninitialized, we cannot bound it. Therefore, we do not have any loop invariant to state before the loop starts.\n\nDuring the loop execution, we can state that `x` is always less than or equal to `0x0fffffff`. This is because the loop condition is `x < 0x0fffffff`, and the loop body increments `x` by 1 in each iteration. Hence, the following loop invariant is true in every iteration of the loop:\n\n```\n/*@ loop invariant x <= 0x0fffffff; */\n```\n\nAfter the loop termination, we need to ensure that `x` is greater than `0x0fffffff`. Since we cannot bound `x` before the loop starts, we need to use the loop invariant that we derived during the loop execution to prove the post-condition.\n\nWe can use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. Hence, the following loop invariant is true after the loop termination:\n\n```\n/*@ loop invariant x >= 0x0fffffff ==> x > 0x0fffffff; */\n```\n\nFinally, since `x` is non-deterministic at the beginning of the loop, we need to use implication to make the loop invariant true at that location.

So, we cannot make any assumptions about the value of `x` at the beginning of the program.\n\nNext, let's analyze the loop body. The loop simply increments `x` until it becomes greater than or equal to `0x0fffffff`. \n\nNow, let's consider the post-condition `x > 0x0fffffff`. We can use implication to handle the conditional nature of the program. The post-condition is true if and only if the loop terminates and `x` is greater than `0x0fffffff`.\n\nLet's start by finding a loop invariant that is true before the loop execution. Since we cannot make any assumptions about the initial value of `x`, we cannot use `x >= 0` as a loop invariant. However, we can use `x <= 0x0fffffff` as a loop invariant because `x` is incremented in each iteration of the loop.\n\nNow, let's find a loop invariant that is true in every iteration of the loop. Since the loop simply increments `x`, we can use `x <= 0x0fffffff` as a loop invariant in every iteration of the loop.\n\nFinally, let's find a loop invariant that is true after the loop termination.
