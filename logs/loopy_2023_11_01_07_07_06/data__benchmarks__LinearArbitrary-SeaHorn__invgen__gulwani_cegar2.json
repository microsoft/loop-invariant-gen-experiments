The input to Frama-C is a C program file with ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations.\nFor the given program, find the necessary loop invariants of the while loop to help Frama-C verify the post-condition.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. \n- Output loop invariants that are true \n(i) before the loop execution, \n(ii) in every iteration of the loop and \n(iii) after the loop termination, \nsuch that the loop invariants imply the post condition.\n- If a loop invariant is a conjunction, split it into its parts.\n- Output all the loop invariants in one code block.

            "Pre-conditions:\n- The function `unknown()` returns a non-negative integer value.\n\nVariable assignments:\n- `n` is assigned the value returned by `unknown()`.\n- `x` is assigned the value `0`.\n- `m` is assigned the value `0`.\n\nLoop condition:\n- The loop continues as long as `x` is less than `n`.\n\nLoop invariants:\n- Before the loop execution:\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant 0 <= x <= n;\n  loop invariant m <= x <= n;\n*/\n```\nExplanation: Since `x` starts at `0` and increments by `1` in every iteration until it becomes greater than or equal to `n`, `0 <= x <= n` is true before the loop execution. Since `m` is initially `0` and can only be updated to a value less than or equal to `x` inside the loop, `m <= x` is true before the loop execution.\n\n- In every iteration of the loop:\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant 0 <= x <= n;\n  loop invariant m <= x <= n;\n  loop invariant (m == \\old(m)) || (m == \\old(x) && unknown());\n*/\n```\nExplanation: `0 <= x <= n` and `m <= x <= n` are the same as before. The third invariant is a bit more complex. It says that either `m` remains the same as its old value, or it is updated to `x` if `unknown()` returns `true`. This invariant is necessary because `m` is only updated conditionally inside the loop. \n\n- After the loop termination:\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant 0 <= x <= n;\n  loop invariant m <= x <= n;\n  loop invariant (n == 0) ==> (m == 0);\n  loop invariant (n > 0) ==> (m >= 0 && m < n);\n*/\n```\nExplanation: `0 <= x <= n` and `m <= x <= n` are still true. The third invariant says that if `n` is `0`, then `m` must also be `0`. This is because the loop would not have executed at all if `n` is `0`, and the assertion would trivially hold. The fourth invariant is the most important one. It says that if `n` is greater than `0`, then `m` must be between `0` and `n-1`, inclusive. This is because `m` is updated only when `unknown()` returns `true`, and since we do not know anything about the behavior of `unknown()`, we need to assume that `m` can take on any value between `0` and `n-1`, inclusive.\n\nPutting everything together, we get the following code block:\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant 0 <= x <= n;\n  loop invariant m <= x <= n;\n  loop invariant (m == \\old(m)) || (m == \\old(x) && unknown());\n  loop invariant (n == 0) ==> (m == 0);\n  loop invariant (n > 0) ==> (m >= 0 && m < n);\n*/\n```",
