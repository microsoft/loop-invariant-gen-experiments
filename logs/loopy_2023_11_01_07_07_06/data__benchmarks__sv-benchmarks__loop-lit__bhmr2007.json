Hence, the invariant holds trivially.\n- Assume that the invariant holds at the beginning of an iteration of the loop.\n- Inside the loop, either `a` is incremented by `1` and `b` is incremented by `2`, or `a` is incremented by `2` and `b` is incremented by `1`. \n- In the first case, the sum `a + b` increases by `3`. In the second case, it increases by `3` as well. Hence, `a + b` increases by `3` in every iteration of the loop.\n- Also, if `i` is even, then `i % 2 == 0`, and `a + b` is currently `2 * ((i - 1) / 2)`. If `i` is odd, then `i % 2 == 1`, and `a + b` is currently `2 * ((i - 1) / 2) + 1`. Hence, the loop invariant holds at the end of every iteration of the loop.\n- At the end of the loop, `i` is equal to `n`. Hence, `a + b == 2 * ((n - 1) / 2) + (n % 2 == 0 ? 0 : 1)`, which is equal to `3 * n / 2` if `n` is even, and `(3 * n - 1) / 2` if `n` is odd. Since `a + b` must be an integer, it follows that `a + b == 3 * n` if and only if `n` is even. \n- Therefore, the loop invariant `a + b == 2 * ((i - 1) / 2) + (i % 2 == 0 ? 0 : 1)` implies the post-condition `a + b == 3 * n` when `n` is even. If `n` is odd, then the post-condition is not satisfied, but the loop invariant still holds.",
            "Pre-conditions:\n- The macro `assume(e)` checks if the condition `e` is true. If not, it returns 0.\n- The macro `LARGE_INT` defines the maximum value of `n`.\n- The function `unknown_int()` returns an unknown integer value.\n\nVariable Assignments:\n- `i`, `a`, `b` and `n` are initialized to 0.\n- The value of `n` is obtained from `unknown_int()`.\n- `a` and `b` are updated based on the value returned by `unknown_int()` inside the loop.\n- `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.\n\nLoop Condition:\n- The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.\n\nPost-condition:\n- The sum of `a` and `b` is equal to `3*n`.\n\nLoop Invariants:\n- Before the loop: Since `i` is initially 0 and is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, it is less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, we can use the following loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant 0 <= i <= n;\n*/\n```\n\n- In every iteration: The loop body has two possibilities, depending on the value of `unknown_int()`. In the first case, `a` is incremented by 1 and `b` is incremented by 2. In the second case, `a` is incremented by 2 and `b` is incremented by 1. Therefore, after each iteration, the difference between `a` and `b` will either remain the same or increase by 1. Since the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`, we can use the following loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant 0 <= i <= n && (a-b) <= i;\n*/\n```\n\n- After the loop: At the end of the loop, `i` is equal to `n`. Therefore, we can use the following loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant i == n ==> a + b == 3*n;\n*/\n```\nWe use implication here to take care of the conditional nature of the code.\n\n- Variable bounds: Since `n` is obtained from `unknown_int()`, we do not know its exact value. However, we know that it is between 0 and `LARGE_INT`. Therefore, we can use the following variable bounds:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant 0 <= n <= LARGE_INT;\n    loop invariant 0 <= a <= 3*n;\n    loop invariant 0 <= b <= 3*n;\n*/\n```\n\n- Variable relations: Since `a` is incremented by either 1 or 2 in each iteration, and `b` is incremented by either 1 or 2 in each iteration, we know that the difference between `a` and `b` will always be odd. Therefore, we can use the following variable relation:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant (a-b)%2 == 0;\n*/\n```\n\nPutting all these together, we get the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant 0 <= n <= LARGE_INT;\n    loop invariant 0 <= a <= 3*n;\n    loop invariant 0 <= b <= 3*n;\n    loop invariant (a-b)%2 == 0;\n    loop invariant 0 <= i <= n && (a-b) <= i;\n    loop invariant i == n ==> a + b == 3*n;\n*/\n```",

We know that `a` and `b` are incremented by 1 or 2 in each iteration of the loop, so the sum `a + b` is always a multiple of 3. Therefore, this invariant holds true before and after the loop.

This is true because the loop terminates when `i` becomes equal to `n`, and we know that `a + b` is a multiple of 3 at this point.

Hence, the invariant holds trivially.\n- Assume that the invariant holds at the beginning of an iteration of the loop.\n- Inside the loop, either `a` is incremented by `1` and `b` is incremented by `2`, or `a` is incremented by `2` and `b` is incremented by `1`. \n- In the first case, the sum `a + b` increases by `3`. In the second case, it increases by `3` as well. Hence, `a + b` increases by `3` in every iteration of the loop.\n- Also, if `i` is even, then `i % 2 == 0`, and `a + b` is currently `2 * ((i - 1) / 2)`. If `i` is odd, then `i % 2 == 1`, and `a + b` is currently `2 * ((i - 1) / 2) + 1`. Hence, the loop invariant holds at the end of every iteration of the loop.\n- At the end of the loop, `i` is equal to `n`. Hence, `a + b == 2 * ((n - 1) / 2) + (n % 2 == 0 ? 0 : 1)`, which is equal to `3 * n / 2` if `n` is even, and `(3 * n - 1) / 2` if `n` is odd. Since `a + b` must be an integer, it follows that `a + b == 3 * n` if and only if `n` is even. \n- Therefore, the loop invariant `a + b == 2 * ((i - 1) / 2) + (i % 2 == 0 ? 0 : 1)` implies the post-condition `a + b == 3 * n` when `n` is even. If `n` is odd, then the post-condition is not satisfied, but the loop invariant still holds.",
