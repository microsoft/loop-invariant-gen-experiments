Also, we know that `bound_off` is equal to `0 + (MAXPATHLEN + 1) - 1`.\n\nNow, let's add loop invariants for the other variables used in the loop.\n\n- `pattern_off`:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant 0 <= pattern_off <= MAXPATHLEN;\n*/\n```\nWe know that `pattern_off` should always be between 0 and `MAXPATHLEN` (inclusive).\n\n- `glob3_pathbuf_off`:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant 0 <= glob3_pathbuf_off <= MAXPATHLEN;\n    loop invariant glob3_pathbuf_off == buf_off;\n*/\n```\nWe know that `glob3_pathbuf_off` should always be between 0 and `MAXPATHLEN` (inclusive).

This is because the loop terminates when `glob3_pathend_off + glob3_dc >= glob3_pathlim_off` and `unknown()` is false, but we need to ensure that the post-condition holds even when `unknown()` is true.\n\nSo, the necessary loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@\nloop invariant glob3_pathend_off <= glob3_pathlim_off;\nloop invariant glob3_dc >= 0;\nloop invariant glob3_dc < MAXPATHLEN + 1;\nloop invariant (glob3_pathend_off + glob3_dc < glob3_pathlim_off) ==> (unknown() == 0);\nloop invariant (glob3_pathend_off + glob3_dc >= glob3_pathlim_off) ==> (unknown() == 1);\n*/\n```\nNote that we used implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code and to ensure that the loop invariants imply the post-condition.

We need to find loop invariants that are true before, during, and after the loop execution, such that they imply the post-condition. \n\n**Pre-conditions:**\n\n- The value of `MAXPATHLEN` is returned by an external function `unknown()`.\n- All variables contain garbage values, except `MAXPATHLEN`.\n- `MAXPATHLEN` is greater than zero.\n\n**Variable assignments:**\n\n- `buf_off` is assigned 0.\n- `pattern_off` is assigned 0.\n- `bound_off` is assigned `MAXPATHLEN`.\n- `glob3_pathbuf_off` is assigned `buf_off`.\n- `glob3_pathend_off` is assigned `buf_off`.\n- `glob3_pathlim_off` is assigned `bound_off`.\n- `glob3_pattern_off` is assigned `pattern_off`.\n- `glob3_dc` is assigned 0.\n\n**Loop condition:**\n\n- `glob3_pathend_off + glob3_dc < glob3_pathlim_off`\n\n**Post-condition:**\n\n- None explicitly specified. Therefore, we assume that the program should terminate successfully.\n\n**Loop Invariants:**\n- `0 <= glob3_dc` \n- `glob3_dc < MAXPATHLEN + 1`\n- `glob3_pathbuf_off == buf_off`\n- `glob3_pathend_off >= buf_off`\n- `glob3_pathend_off <= glob3_pathlim_off`\n- `glob3_pathlim_off == bound_off`\n- `glob3_pattern_off == pattern_off`\n- `(glob3_pathend_off + glob3_dc >= glob3_pathlim_off) ==> (glob3_dc == MAXPATHLEN + 1)`\n- `(glob3_pathend_off + glob3_dc < glob3_pathlim_off) ==> (glob3_dc <= MAXPATHLEN)`\n\nExplanation of Loop Invariants:\n- `0 <= glob3_dc`: This is true before the loop execution because `glob3_dc` is initialized to 0. This is true during the loop execution because `glob3_dc` is incremented by 1 in each iteration. This is true after the loop execution because the loop terminates when `glob3_dc` becomes greater than or equal to `MAXPATHLEN + 1`.\n- `glob3_dc < MAXPATHLEN + 1`: This is true before the loop execution because `glob3_dc` is initialized to 0 and `MAXPATHLEN` is greater than 0. This is true during the loop execution because `glob3_dc` is incremented by 1 in each iteration and the loop terminates when `glob3_dc` becomes greater than or equal to `MAXPATHLEN + 1`. This is true after the loop execution because `glob3_dc` is equal to `MAXPATHLEN + 1` after the loop terminates.\n- `glob3_pathbuf_off == buf_off`: This is true before the loop execution because `glob3_pathbuf_off` is assigned the value of `buf_off`. This is true during the loop execution because `glob3_pathbuf_off` is not modified inside the loop. This is true after the loop execution because `glob3_pathbuf_off` is not modified inside the loop.\n- `glob3_pathend_off >= buf_off`: This is true before the loop execution because `glob3_pathend_off` is assigned the value of `buf_off`. This is true during the loop execution because `glob3_pathend_off` is incremented by 1 in each iteration. This is true after the loop execution because `glob3_pathend_off` is not modified inside the loop.\n- `glob3_pathend_off <= glob3_pathlim_off`: This is true before the loop execution because `glob3_pathend_off` and `glob3_pathlim_off` are assigned the same value. This is true during the loop execution because `glob3_pathend_off` is incremented by 1 in each iteration and `glob3_pathlim_off` is not modified inside the loop. This is true after the loop execution because `glob3_pathend_off` is not modified inside the loop and `glob3_pathend_off` is less than or equal to `glob3_pathlim_off`.\n- `glob3_pathlim_off == bound_off`: This is true before the loop execution because `glob3_pathlim_off` is assigned the value of `bound_off`. This is true during the loop execution because `glob3_pathlim_off` is not modified inside the loop. This is true after the loop execution because `glob3_pathlim_off` is not modified inside the loop.\n- `glob3_pattern_off == pattern_off`: This is true before the loop execution because `glob3_pattern_off` is assigned the value of `pattern_off`. This is true during the loop execution because `glob3_pattern_off` is not modified inside the loop.",
