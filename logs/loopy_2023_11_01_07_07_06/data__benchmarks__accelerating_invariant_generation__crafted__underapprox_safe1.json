The input to Frama-C is a C program file with ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations.\nFor the given program, find the necessary loop invariants of the while loop to help Frama-C verify the post-condition.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. \n- Output loop invariants that are true \n(i) before the loop execution, \n(ii) in every iteration of the loop and \n(iii) after the loop termination, \nsuch that the loop invariants imply the post condition.\n- If a loop invariant is a conjunction, split it into its parts.\n- Output all the loop invariants in one code block. For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values.

Therefore, x will always be less than or equal to 6. Also, y is multiplied by 2 in each iteration, so y will always be equal to 2 raised to the power of x.\n- After the loop termination, x will be equal to 6. Therefore, if x equals 6, then y must be divisible by 3. This is because 2 raised to the power of 6 is 64, and 64 is not divisible by 3. Therefore, if x equals 6, then y must have been multiplied by 3 at some point, which means y must be divisible by 3.\n\nPutting it together:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x <= 6;\n    loop invariant y == pow(2,x);\n    loop invariant (x == 6) ==> (y % 3 == 0);\n*/\n```",

Therefore, the relation `y == pow(2, x)` holds true throughout the loop.\n- After the loop termination, `x` is equal to 6 and `y` is equal to `pow(2, 6)`, which is equal to 64. Since `64 % 3` is equal to 1, the relation `y % 3 == 0` holds true after the loop termination.\n- Since the assertion is not guarded by any condition, we do not need to use implication.\n- There are no non-deterministic variables in the program, so we do not need to use any implications to make the loop invariants trivially true.\n\nPutting it all together, the loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant y == pow(2, x);\n    loop invariant y % 3 == 0;\n*/\n```",

Hence, the first two invariants hold true.\n- Before the loop, `x` is equal to `0` which satisfies the last two invariants.\n- In each iteration, `x` is incremented by `1` and `y` is multiplied by `2`. Hence, `x` becomes greater than or equal to `1` and less than or equal to `6`. `y` continues to be a power of `2` and is always greater than or equal to `1`.\n- After the loop, `x` is equal to `6`.

Since `64` is not divisible by `3`, the assertion holds true. \n\nTherefore, the necessary loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant (y > 0) && (\\forall integer i; i >= 0 && i < x ==> y == 2^i);\n    loop invariant (x >= 1) && (x <= 6);\n*/\n```",

This function is defined in the math.h library, which is not included in the program. Therefore, we cannot use it in the loop invariant. Instead, we can manually compute the values of `y` for each value of `x` and use them in the invariant. \n\nWe also did not need to add any implications to the loop invariants, as all variables are initialized with deterministic values, and the program does not contain any conditional statements that could affect the loop invariants."
