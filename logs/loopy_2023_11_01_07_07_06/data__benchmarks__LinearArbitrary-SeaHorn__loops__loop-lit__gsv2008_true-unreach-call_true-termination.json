After the loop, the program checks if `y > 0`.\n\nNow, let's find the loop invariants:\n\n1. Before the loop, `y` is greater than or equal to 0.

So, we can add the following loop invariant in every iteration:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant x <= 0; */\n```\n\n3. In every iteration of the loop, `y` is always greater than 0. This is because `y` is incremented by 1 in each iteration. So, we can add the following loop invariant in every iteration:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant y > 0; */\n```\n\n4. After the loop, `y` is greater than 0. This is because `y` is incremented by 1 in each iteration and the loop exits when `x` becomes positive. So, we can add the following loop invariant after the loop:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant y > 0; */\n```\n\n5. Finally, we need to show that the loop invariants imply the post-condition, which is `y > 0`.
