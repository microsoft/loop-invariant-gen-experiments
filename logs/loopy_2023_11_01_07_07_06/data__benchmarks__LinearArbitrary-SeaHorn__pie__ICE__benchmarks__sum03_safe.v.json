Since `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, this invariant holds true before the loop execution. In every iteration of the loop, `x` is incremented by 1, so `sn` will also be incremented by 1. Therefore, `sn` will always be equal to `x * 1` or `0`, which implies that this invariant holds true in every iteration of the loop.\n- `v1 >= INT_MIN && v1 <= INT_MAX` (true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop): This invariant states that the value of variable `v1` is always within the range of `INT_MIN` and `INT_MAX`. Since `v1` is assigned a value from `unknown_int()` in each iteration of the loop, this invariant holds true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop.\n- `v2 >= INT_MIN && v2 <= INT_MAX` (true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop): This invariant states that the value of variable `v2` is always within the range of `INT_MIN` and `INT_MAX`. Since `v2` is assigned a value from `unknown_int()` in each iteration of the loop, this invariant holds true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop.\n- `v3 >= INT_MIN && v3 <= INT_MAX` (true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop): This invariant states that the value of variable `v3` is always within the range of `INT_MIN` and `INT_MAX`. Since `v3` is assigned a value from `unknown_int()` in each iteration of the loop, this invariant holds true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop.\n- `x <= UINT_MAX` (true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop): This invariant states that the value of variable `x` is always within the range of `0` and `UINT_MAX`. Since `x` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, this invariant holds true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop.\n- `sn >= 0` (true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop): This invariant states that the value of variable `sn` is always greater than or equal to `0`. Since `sn` is initialized to `0` and then incremented by `1` in each iteration of the loop, this invariant holds true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop.\n- `(v1 >= INT_MIN && v1 <= INT_MAX) ==> (sn == x * 1 || sn == 0)` (true in every iteration of the loop): This invariant states that if the value of variable `v1` is within the range of `INT_MIN` and `INT_MAX`, then the invariant `sn == x * 1 || sn == 0` holds true. Since the assertion in the loop body is guarded by no condition, we can use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. Therefore, this invariant holds true in every iteration of the loop.\n- `(v2 >= INT_MIN && v2 <= INT_MAX) ==> (sn == x * 1 || sn == 0)` (true in every iteration of the loop): This invariant states that if the value of variable `v2` is within the range of `INT_MIN` and `INT_MAX`, then the invariant `sn == x * 1 || sn == 0` holds true. Since the assertion in the loop body is guarded by no condition, we can use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code.
