            "**Step 1: Pre-conditions and variable assignments**\nThere are no pre-conditions in the program. The variable assignments are:\n- `int x = 0`: Initializes variable `x` to 0.\n- `int y = 0`: Initializes variable `y` to 0.\n\n**Step 2: Loop condition**\nThe loop condition is `unknown_int()`. This means that the loop will execute an unknown number of times until `unknown_int()` returns 0.\n\n**Step 3: Loop invariants**\nLet's analyze the loop body and identify some loop invariants. \n\n- `x >= 0`: `x` is initialized to 0 and is only incremented. Therefore, `x` is always greater than or equal to 0.\n- `y >= 0`: `y` is initialized to 0 and is only incremented. Therefore, `y` is always greater than or equal to 0.\n- `x <= y/100 + 4`: `x` is incremented by 1 if the first `unknown_int()` returns true, which increases `y` by 100. Therefore, `y` is always greater than or equal to 100 times the number of times `x` is incremented plus the initial value of `y`. This can be written as `y >= 100*x + 0`. Solving for `x`, we get `x <= y/100`. Additionally, if `x` becomes greater than or equal to 4, it is incremented by 1 only if the second `unknown_int()` returns true. Therefore, `x` can be at most 4 more than `y` divided by 100. This gives us the loop invariant `x <= y/100 + 4`.\n- `x >= 0 && x < 5`: If `x` is incremented in the first `if` block, it can be at most 4 because of the condition `if (x >= 4)`. Therefore, `x` is always less than 5.\n- `y >= 0 && y <= 100*x + 100`: Similar to the previous invariant, `y` is incremented by 100 in the first `if` block. Therefore, `y` is at most 100 more than 100 times `x` plus the initial value of `y`. This gives us the loop invariant `y <= 100*x + 100`.\n\nCombining all the loop invariants, we get:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n    loop invariant x <= y/100 + 4;\n    loop invariant x >= 0 && x < 5;\n    loop invariant y >= 0 && y <= 100*x + 100;\n*/\n```\n\n**Step 4: Implications for non-deterministic variables**\nThe variables `x` and `y` are not explicitly initialized in the program, but their initial value is assumed to be 0.
