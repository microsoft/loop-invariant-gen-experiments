The first invariant y == 2^x is true because 2^0 = 1. The second invariant x >= 0 is true because x is an unsigned integer and it cannot be negative.\n\nNow, let's find the loop invariants that hold in every iteration of the loop:\n- y == 2^x\n- x >= 0\n- x <= 6\n\nExplanation: The first invariant y == 2^x holds because y is multiplied by 2 in every iteration, and x is incremented by 1 in every iteration. The second invariant x >= 0 holds because x is an unsigned integer and it cannot be negative. The third invariant x <= 6 holds because the loop condition is x < 6.\n\nFinally, let's find the loop invariants that hold after the loop termination:\n- y == 2^x\n- x >= 6 ==> y % 3 == 0\n\nExplanation: After the loop termination, the first invariant y == 2^x still holds for the same reasons as in the previous step. The second invariant x >= 6 ==> y % 3 == 0 holds because if x >= 6, then y == 2^x is a multiple of 3. This is because 2^2 == 1 mod 3, so 2^x == 2^(x-2) mod 3 for all x >= 2. Therefore, if x >= 6, then y == 2^x is a multiple of 3, and the assertion y % 3 holds.\n\nPutting it all together, the loop invariants are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant y == 2^x;\n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant x <= 6;\n    loop invariant x >= 6 ==> y % 3 == 0;\n*/\n```",

Since 64 is not divisible by 3, we add the implication x == 6 ==> y % 3 == 0 to the loop invariant.\n\nPutting it all together, the loop invariants for the while loop are:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant y >= 1;\n    loop invariant x < 6;\n    loop invariant y == pow(2, x);\n    loop invariant (x == 6) ==> (y % 3 == 0);\n*/\n```",
