Therefore, `x1` is equal to the sum of `j1` from `i=0` to `i` in the current iteration. This can be written as `x1 = i*j1`.\n- The fifth invariant is true before the loop starts since `x2` is initialized to 0 and is updated to `x2 + j2` in each iteration of the loop. Therefore, `x2` is equal to the sum of `j2` from `i=1` to `i` in the current iteration. This can be written as `x2 = c + 5*sum(1, i-1, j2)`. \n\nNow, we need to show that these invariants hold in every iteration of the loop and after the loop termination.\n- Assume the invariants hold at the beginning of an arbitrary iteration of the loop.\n- Then, `i < n` since the loop condition is true, and hence `0 <= i < n`.\n- `j1` is updated as `j1 = 5*i + c`.\n- `j2` is updated as `j2 = j2 + 5` if `i` is not equal to 10, and `j2 = 10` if `i` is equal to 10. Therefore, if `i` is greater than 1, then `j2` can be written as `5*(i-1) + c`.\n- `x1` is updated as `x1 = x1 + j1`. Therefore, `x1` can be written as `i*j1`.\n- `x2` is updated as `x2 = x2 + j2`. Therefore, `x2` can be written as `c + 5*sum(1, i-1, j2) + j2` if `i` is not equal to 10, and `c + 5*sum(1, i-1, j2) + 10` if `i` is equal to 10. \n- We need to show that the invariants hold at the end of this iteration.\n- If `i` is not equal to `n`, then the loop continues and the invariants hold at the beginning of the next iteration. \n- If `i` is equal to `n`, then the loop terminates and we need to show that the post-condition `x1 == x2` holds.\n- We have `x1 = n*j1` and `x2 = c*n + 5*sum(1, n-1, j2) + j2_n` where `j2_n` is the value of `j2` in the last iteration.\n- If `n` is equal to 1, then `j2_n = c` and the",
