            "Pre-conditions:\n- x is initialized to 0.\n\nLoop condition:\n- x < 99\n\nLoop Invariants:\n1. x is even before the loop execution.\n2. If y is even, then x is odd and if y is odd then x is even at the beginning of each iteration.\n3. x <= 99 in every iteration of the loop.\n4. If x is odd at the beginning of an iteration, then it will be even at the end of the iteration.\n5. If x is even at the beginning of an iteration, then it will be odd or equal to the previous value at the end of the iteration.\n6. x is odd or equal to the previous value at the end of each iteration.\n7. If y is even, then x is odd and if y is odd then x is even after the loop termination.\n8. (x % 2) == (y % 2) after the loop termination.\n\nExplanation:\n1. Since the first conditional statement in the loop checks if y is even, it does not affect the parity of x. Therefore, x is even before the loop execution.\n2. The if-else statement inside the loop modifies x based on the parity of y. Therefore, if y is even, x is incremented by 1 and becomes odd. If y is odd, x is incremented by 2 and becomes even. Hence, x and y have opposite parity at the beginning of each iteration.\n3. The loop condition specifies that x should be less than 99. Therefore, x is always less than or equal to 99 in every iteration of the loop.\n4. If x is odd, then it is incremented by 1 and becomes even. Hence, x is even at the end of the iteration.\n5. If x is even, then either it is incremented by 1 and becomes odd or it is not changed and remains even. Hence, x is odd or equal to the previous value at the end of the iteration.\n6. Combining 4 and 5, we get that x is odd or equal to the previous value at the end of each iteration.\n7. Since the loop condition specifies that x should be less than 99, x cannot be incremented anymore. Therefore, x can only be even if y is even and x can only be odd if y is odd. Hence, x and y have opposite parity after the loop termination.\n8. The assertion checks if the parity of x and y are the same after the loop termination. Since we have shown that x and y have opposite parity after the loop termination, the assertion is true only if they are both odd or both even. Hence, (x % 2) == (y % 2) after the loop termination. \n\nBounds:\n- Since x is incremented by at least 1 in each iteration, it will be at least 99 at the end of the loop. Hence, x <= 99 in every iteration of the loop.\n- We do not have any bounds for y. Hence, we cannot add any bounds on y.\n\nRelation:\n- We do not have any relation between x and y that we can add as a loop invariant.\n\nTrivial invariants:\n- We do not have any non-deterministic variables in this program. Hence, we do not need to add any trivial invariants. \n\nPutting everything together, we get the following loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x % 2 == 0; //1\n    loop invariant ((y % 2 == 0) ==> (x % 2 == 1)) && ((y % 2 == 1) ==> (x % 2 == 0)); //2\n    loop invariant x <= 99; //3\n    loop invariant ((\\old(x) % 2 == 1) ==> (x % 2 == 0)); //4\n    loop invariant ((\\old(x) % 2 == 0) ==> (x % 2 == 1 || x == \\old(x))); //5\n    loop invariant (x % 2 == 1 || x == \\old(x)); //6\n    loop invariant ((y % 2 == 0) ==> (x % 2 == 1)) && ((y % 2 == 1) ==> (x % 2 == 0)) ==> x <= 99; //7\n    loop invariant ((x % 2) == (y % 2)) ==> (x % 2 == 0 || x % 2 == 1); //8\n*/\n```",

Therefore, it is necessary to add a precondition that y should contain either an even or an odd number before the loop execution. However, since we are not allowed to use non-deterministic function calls, we cannot use a function like rand() to generate a random even or odd number. Therefore, we have to assume that the user has provided an even or an odd number as the input value of y. We can add the following precondition to the program:\n```\n//@ assert (y % 2 == 0 || y % 2 == 1);\n``` \nThis assertion ensures that y contains either an even or an odd number before the loop execution.",
