Also, `idBitLength / 8` is constant and non-negative, hence `j` is always less than or equal to `idBitLength / 8`.\n- Loop invariant 2: `0 <= j <= material_length` is true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop because `j` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in every iteration of the loop. Also, `material_length` is non-negative, hence `j` is always less than or equal to `material_length`.\n- Loop invariant 3: `0 <= j / 4 <= nlen` is true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop because `j` is non-negative and increments by 1 in every iteration of the loop. Also, `nlen` is non-negative and `j / 4` is always less than or equal to `nlen`.\n- Loop invariant 4: `j / 4 <= nlen` is true before the loop execution because `j` starts at 0. In every iteration of the loop, `j` increases by 1 and hence `j / 4` also increases by 1 or remains the same. Since `j / 4` is always less than or equal to `nlen`, this loop invariant holds in every iteration of the loop. After the loop termination, `j` is either equal to `idBitLength / 8` or `material_length`, whichever is smaller. Hence, `j / 4` is also less than or equal to `nlen`. Therefore, this loop invariant holds after the loop termination. \n\nNote that the assertions inside the loop are trivially true because they are implied by the loop invariants. Hence, we do not need to include them in the loop invariants. \n\nAlso, since all variables are non-deterministic at the beginning and end of the loop, we do not need to add any additional implications to make the loop invariants true at those locations.",
