The maximum value of `x` occurs when `i = n` and `y = 1`. Therefore, `x` is bounded by `n` above. Similarly, the minimum value of `x` occurs when `i = n` and `y = -1`. Therefore, `x` is bounded by `-n` below.\n- The fourth condition is the same as the third condition of the loop invariant.\n",

In every iteration, `i` increases by 1 and `y` is assigned a new value, but `x` is updated by subtracting `y` and then adding `y`, so the equation `x == (i * y)` still holds. After the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n` and `x` is equal to 0, so the equation `x == (i * y)` still holds.\n- The third invariant is true before the loop execution because `y` is initially 0, so `y != 0` holds. In every iteration, `y` is assigned a new non-zero value, so `y != 0` still holds. After the last iteration, `y` is not used, so the invariant still holds.\n- The fourth invariant is true because if `x` is not equal to 0, then the assertion `x != 0` inside the loop would have failed, causing the function to return 0. Therefore, if `x` is not equal to 0, the loop has completed exactly `n` iterations.\n- The fifth invariant is true because if `x` is equal to 0, then the loop has completed less than `n` iterations because the assertion `x != 0` inside the loop would have failed if `x` had been equal to 0 in a previous iteration, causing the function to return 0.\n- The sixth invariant is true because the assertion `x == 0` at the end of the function would have failed if `x` had not been equal to 0 after the last iteration of the loop.",
