It holds because `buf` is initialized to `0` and incremented in every iteration of the loop until it reaches `bufferlen`.\n- Invariant 2: This is also true before the loop execution and in every iteration of the loop. It holds because `in` is initialized to `0` and incremented in every iteration of the loop until it reaches `inlen`.\n- Invariant 3: This is true in every iteration of the loop. It holds because if `buf` is less than or equal to `buflim + 1`, then `in` must be less than `inlen` in order for the loop to continue. This is because the loop condition is always true, so the only way to exit the loop is if `buf` reaches `buflim + 1` or if `in` reaches `inlen`.\n- Invariant 4: This is true after the loop termination. It holds because if `buf` is greater than `buflim + 1`, then `in` must be equal to `inlen` because the loop can only exit if `buf` reaches `buflim + 1` or if `in` reaches `inlen`. Since `buf` has exceeded `buflim + 1`, `in` must have reached `inlen`. \n\nNote that we did not need to add any bounds on the variables because we do not have enough information about the `unknown_int()` function to make any assumptions about the range of values that these variables can take.",
