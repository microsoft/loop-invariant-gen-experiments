The loop body has two parts:\n```\nh1 = f1 + g1;\nf1 = g1;\ng1 = h1;\nn --;\n\nh2 = f2 + g2;\nf2 = g2;\ng2 = h2;\n```\nFrom the above code, we can infer the following:\n- `h1` is the sum of `f1` and `g1`.\n- `f1` is assigned the value of `g1`.\n- `g1` is assigned the value of `h1`.\n- `h2` is the sum of `f2` and `g2`.\n- `f2` is assigned the value of `g2`.\n- `g2` is assigned the value of `h2`.\n\nNext, let's consider the pre-conditions and variable assignments:\n- `n` is non-deterministic at the beginning of the loop.\n- `f1` is assigned the value `0`.\n- `f2` is assigned the value `1`.\n- `g1` is assigned the value `1`.\n- `g2` is assigned the value `1`.\n- `h1` is assigned the value `0`.\n- `h2` is assigned the value `1`.\n\nNow, let's think about the post-condition of the loop.

Hence, the assertion above can be rewritten as:\n```\n//@ assert(f2+g2==f1+g1);\n```\nThe post-condition of the loop is that `f2 + g2` should be equal to `f1 + g1`.\n\nNow, let's find the loop invariants:\n- `f1 >= 0`\n- `f2 >= 1`\n- `g1 >= 1`\n- `g2 >= 1`\n- `h1 == f1 + g1`\n- `h2 == f2 + g2`\n- `f2 + g2 == f1 + g1`\n\nWe can prove that the loop invariant `f2 + g2 == f1 + g1` is true before the loop execution. At the beginning of the loop, `f1` is `0` and `g1` is `1`. Similarly, `f2` is `1` and `g2` is `1`. Hence, `f2 + g2` is `2` and `f1 + g1` is `1`. The loop condition is `n > 0`, hence the loop executes at least once. At the end of the first iteration, `f1` becomes `1`, `g1` becomes `2`, `f2` becomes `1` and `g2` becomes `2`. Hence, `f2 + g2` is `3` and `f1 + g1` is `3`. The loop invariant `f2 + g2 == f1 + g1` holds at the end of the first iteration.\n\nNow, let's prove that the loop invariant `f2 + g2 == f1 + g1` holds in every iteration of the loop. Assume that the loop invariant holds at the beginning of some iteration of the loop. Then, `f2 + g2` is equal to `f1 + g1`. In the loop body, `h1 = f1 + g1`, `f1 = g1` and `g1 = h1`. Hence, at the end of the iteration, `f1 + g1` is equal to `g1 + h1`, which is equal to `h1 + h1`, which is equal to `h1 + f1`. Similarly, `h2 = f2 + g2`, `f2 = g2` and `g2 = h2`. Hence, at the end of the iteration, `f2 + g2` is equal to `g2 + h2`, which is equal to `h2 + h2`, which is equal to `h2 + f2`. Hence, `f2 + g2` is equal to `f1 + g1` at the end of the iteration. Therefore, the loop invariant `f2 + g2 == f1 + g1` holds in every iteration of the loop.\n\nFinally, let's prove that the loop invariant `f2 + g2 == f1 + g1` implies the post-condition `f2 + g2 == f1 + g1`.

We do not know the value of n, but we know that it is non-negative since it is of type int.\n\nLoop Invariant 2: `f1 == 0 && f2 == 1`\n- This is true before the loop starts because f1 is assigned 0 and f2 is assigned 1.\n\nLoop Invariant 3: `g1 == 1 && g2 == 1`\n- This is true before the loop starts because g1 is assigned 1 and g2 is assigned 1.\n\nLoop Invariant 4: `h1 == 0 && h2 == 0`\n- This is true before the loop starts because h1 is assigned 0 and h2 is assigned 0.\n\nNow, let's find loop invariants that are true in every iteration of the loop:\n\nLoop Invariant 5: `f1 <= g1 && f2 <= g2`\n- This is true in every iteration of the loop because f1 and f2 are assigned the value of g1 and g2 respectively in each iteration, and g1 and g2 are assigned the value of h1 and h2 respectively, which is greater than or equal to the previous values of g1 and g2.\n\nLoop Invariant 6: `h1 == f1 + g1 && h2 == f2 + g2`\n- This is true in every iteration of the loop because of the following assignments inside the loop body:\n  - h1 = f1 + g1\n  - h2 = f2 + g2\n\nLoop Invariant 7: `n >= 0`\n- This is true in every iteration of the loop because n is decremented by 1 in each iteration and it starts with a non-negative value.\n\nNow, let's find loop invariants that are true after the loop termination:\n\nLoop Invariant 8: `h2 == f2 + g2`\n- This is true after the loop termination because the loop condition is `n > 0` and n is decremented by 1 in each iteration.

                "llm_output": "First, let's analyze the loop body. The loop body has two parts:\n```\nh1 = f1 + g1;\nf1 = g1;\ng1 = h1;\nn --;\n\nh2 = f2 + g2;\nf2 = g2;\ng2 = h2;\n```\nFrom the above code, we can infer the following:\n- `h1` is the sum of `f1` and `g1`.\n- `f1` is assigned the value of `g1`.\n- `g1` is assigned the value of `h1`.\n- `h2` is the sum of `f2` and `g2`.\n- `f2` is assigned the value of `g2`.\n- `g2` is assigned the value of `h2`.\n\nNext, let's consider the pre-conditions and variable assignments:\n- `n` is non-deterministic at the beginning of the loop.\n- `f1` is assigned the value `0`.\n- `f2` is assigned the value `1`.\n- `g1` is assigned the value `1`.\n- `g2` is assigned the value `1`.\n- `h1` is assigned the value `0`.\n- `h2` is assigned the value `1`.\n\nNow, let's think about the post-condition of the loop. The only assertion present in the loop is:\n```\n//@ assert(h2==h1+f1);\n```\nFrom the above code, we can see that `h2` is the sum of `f2` and `g2`, and `h1` is the sum of `f1` and `g1`. Hence, the assertion above can be rewritten as:\n```\n//@ assert(f2+g2==f1+g1);\n```\nThe post-condition of the loop is that `f2 + g2` should be equal to `f1 + g1`.\n\nNow, let's find the loop invariants:\n- `f1 >= 0`\n- `f2 >= 1`\n- `g1 >= 1`\n- `g2 >= 1`\n- `h1 == f1 + g1`\n- `h2 == f2 + g2`\n- `f2 + g2 == f1 + g1`\n\nWe can prove that the loop invariant `f2 + g2 == f1 + g1` is true before the loop execution. At the beginning of the loop, `f1` is `0` and `g1` is `1`. Similarly, `f2` is `1` and `g2` is `1`. Hence, `f2 + g2` is `2` and `f1 + g1` is `1`. The loop condition is `n > 0`, hence the loop executes at least once. At the end of the first iteration, `f1` becomes `1`, `g1` becomes `2`, `f2` becomes `1` and `g2` becomes `2`. Hence, `f2 + g2` is `3` and `f1 + g1` is `3`. The loop invariant `f2 + g2 == f1 + g1` holds at the end of the first iteration.\n\nNow, let's prove that the loop invariant `f2 + g2 == f1 + g1` holds in every iteration of the loop. Assume that the loop invariant holds at the beginning of some iteration of the loop. Then, `f2 + g2` is equal to `f1 + g1`. In the loop body, `h1 = f1 + g1`, `f1 = g1` and `g1 = h1`. Hence, at the end of the iteration, `f1 + g1` is equal to `g1 + h1`, which is equal to `h1 + h1`, which is equal to `h1 + f1`. Similarly, `h2 = f2 + g2`, `f2 = g2` and `g2 = h2`. Hence, at the end of the iteration, `f2 + g2` is equal to `g2 + h2`, which is equal to `h2 + h2`, which is equal to `h2 + f2`. Hence, `f2 + g2` is equal to `f1 + g1` at the end of the iteration. Therefore, the loop invariant `f2 + g2 == f1 + g1` holds in every iteration of the loop.\n\nFinally, let's prove that the loop invariant `f2 + g2 == f1 + g1` implies the post-condition `f2 + g2 == f1 + g1`.
