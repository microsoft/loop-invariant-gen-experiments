Since we do not know the maximum number of iterations, we need to assume the worst-case scenario, which is that the condition unknown_int() always holds. Therefore, we need to ensure that (3*x <= y-1) holds before and after any iteration of the loop. We can derive the following loop invariants for the post-condition:\n    - (x + y >= 1) ==> (3*x <= y-1)\n    - (x + y < 1) ==> (\\true)  (trivially true)"

Since unknown_int() returns a non-deterministic value, we cannot make any assumptions about the number of iterations. Thus, we cannot derive any loop invariants that depend on the loop counter.\n- The loop body contains three conditional statements. We need to analyze each of them separately to derive loop invariants.\n- In the first conditional statement, if (unknown_int()), the values of x and y may increase by 1 and 2, respectively. Thus, we need to ensure that x and y do not exceed their maximum bounds. Since we do not know the maximum number of iterations, we need to assume the worst-case scenario, which is that the condition unknown_int() always holds. Therefore, we need to ensure that x and y do not exceed their maximum bounds after any iteration of the loop. We can derive the following loop invariants for the first conditional statement:\n    - x + 1 >= x\n    - y + 2 >= y\n- In the second conditional statement, else if (unknown_int()), the values of x and y may increase by 1 and 3, respectively, and the values of z and w may increase by 10. However, this statement is guarded by the condition (x >= 4), so we need to use implication to take care of this conditional nature of the code. We can derive the following loop invariant for the second conditional statement:\n    - (x < 4) ==> (z <= x && w <= y)\n- In the third conditional statement, else if (x >= z && w >= y+1), the values of x and y may be negated. We need to ensure that x and y do not exceed their maximum bounds after any iteration of the loop. We can derive the following loop invariants for the third conditional statement:\n    - (x >= z && w >= y+1) ==> (x <= 0 && y <= 0)\n- After each conditional statement, we have x = x. This assignment does not change the value of x, but we need to include it in the loop invariants to ensure that the invariants hold for all iterations of the loop.\n- Finally, we need to ensure that the post-condition holds after the loop terminates. The post-condition is (3*x <= y-1), which means that we need to ensure that (3*x <= y-1) holds after any number of iterations of the loop. Since we do not know the maximum number of iterations, we need to assume the worst-case scenario, which is that the condition unknown_int() always holds. Therefore, we need to ensure that (3*x <= y-1) holds before and after any iteration of the loop. We can derive the following loop invariants for the post-condition:\n    - (x + y >= 1) ==> (3*x <= y-1)\n    - (x + y < 1) ==> (\\true)  (trivially true)",
