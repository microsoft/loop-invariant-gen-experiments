This condition follows from the fact that the loop iterates from `i=1` to `n` and we increment `i` by 1 in every iteration. So, at the start of every iteration, `i` is at least 1 and at most `n+1`.\n    - `9 <= j <= 10`: This ensures that `j` is always greater than or equal to 9 and less than or equal to 10. This follows from the fact that we initialize `j` to 10 at the beginning of the loop and decrement `j` by 1 in every iteration. So, at the start of every iteration, `j` is at least 9 and at most 10.\n    - `0 <= sn <= (i-1)*a`: This ensures that `sn` is always greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to `(i-1)*a`. This follows from the fact that we add `a` to `sn` in every iteration of the loop only if `i<j`. Since we decrement `j` by 1 in every iteration, `j` is at most `i-1`, which means that we add `a` to `sn` at most `i-1` times. Therefore, the maximum value of `sn` is `(i-1)*a`.\n- After the loop: This ensures that `sn` is either equal to `((long long)n)*a` or 0. Since we add `a` to `sn` only if `i<j`, the maximum value of `sn` is `(n-1)*a`. Therefore, `sn` can only be equal to `((long long)n)*a` if `i` has reached `n+1` at the end of the loop. Otherwise, `sn` will be less than `((long long)n)*a` and equal to `(i-1)*a`. This condition can be written as `sn == ((long long)n)*a || sn == 0`. \n\nNote: Since `unknown_uint` is a non-deterministic function whose definition is not given, we cannot make any assumptions about the value of `n` and the loop invariants should hold for any value of `n`.",
