The loop starts only if `exclusive` is 0, `nonexclusive` is 0, `unowned` is 0, and `invalid` is at least 1. Therefore, this is the necessary pre-condition. \n- In every iteration:\n    - If the condition `unknown_int()` is true: The loop executes the first conditional branch. The program checks if `invalid` is at least 1. This is because `invalid` is decremented by 1 in every iteration of the loop, and if `invalid` becomes 0, the loop will terminate. Therefore, `invalid >= 1` is necessary. The program updates the values of `nonexclusive`, `exclusive`, `unowned`, and `invalid` in this branch. The sum of `nonexclusive` and `exclusive` can only decrease because `exclusive` is set to 0. Therefore, `nonexclusive + exclusive <= \\old(nonexclusive) + \\old(exclusive)` is necessary. The program updates the value of `unowned` by adding `exclusive`. Therefore, `unowned >= 0` is necessary. The program decrements `invalid` by 1. Therefore, `invalid >= 1` is necessary. \n    - If the condition `unknown_int()` is false: The loop executes the second conditional branch. The program checks if `invalid` is at least 1. This is because `invalid` is incremented by `unowned + exclusive + nonexclusive - 1` in this branch, and if the value of `invalid` becomes 0, the loop will terminate. Therefore, `invalid >= 1` is necessary. The program updates the values of `exclusive`, `unowned`, `nonexclusive`, and `invalid` in this branch. The values of `unowned` and `nonexclusive` are set to 0, and the value of `exclusive` is set to 1. Therefore, `exclusive == 1 && unowned == 0 && nonexclusive == 0` is necessary. The value of `invalid` is incremented by `unowned + exclusive + nonexclusive - 1`. Therefore, `invalid >= 1` is necessary. \n- After the loop: The program asserts that the sum of `invalid`, `unowned`, `nonexclusive`, and `exclusive` is at least 1. This is because if the loop terminates, the value of `invalid` will be 0, and the sum of the other variables should be at least 1 for the assertion to hold.

The loop starts only if `exclusive` is 0, `nonexclusive` is 0, `unowned` is 0, and `invalid` is at least 1. Therefore, this is the necessary pre-condition. \n- In every iteration:\n    - If the condition `unknown_int()` is true: The loop executes the first conditional branch. The program checks if `invalid` is at least 1. This is because `invalid` is decremented by 1 in every iteration of the loop, and if `invalid` becomes 0, the loop will terminate. Therefore, `invalid >= 1` is necessary. The program updates the values of `nonexclusive`, `exclusive`, `unowned`, and `invalid` in this branch. The sum of `nonexclusive` and `exclusive` can only decrease because `exclusive` is set to 0. Therefore, `nonexclusive + exclusive <= \\old(nonexclusive) + \\old(exclusive)` is necessary. The program updates the value of `unowned` by adding `exclusive`. Therefore, `unowned >= 0` is necessary. The program decrements `invalid` by 1. Therefore, `invalid >= 1` is necessary. \n    - If the condition `unknown_int()` is false: The loop executes the second conditional branch. The program checks if `invalid` is at least 1. This is because `invalid` is incremented by `unowned + exclusive + nonexclusive - 1` in this branch, and if the value of `invalid` becomes 0, the loop will terminate. Therefore, `invalid >= 1` is necessary. The program updates the values of `exclusive`, `unowned`, `nonexclusive`, and `invalid` in this branch. The values of `unowned` and `nonexclusive` are set to 0, and the value of `exclusive` is set to 1. Therefore, `exclusive == 1 && unowned == 0 && nonexclusive == 0` is necessary. The value of `invalid` is incremented by `unowned + exclusive + nonexclusive - 1`. Therefore, `invalid >= 1` is necessary. \n- After the loop: The program asserts that the sum of `invalid`, `unowned`, `nonexclusive`, and `exclusive` is at least 1. This is because if the loop terminates, the value of `invalid` will be 0, and the sum of the other variables should be at least 1 for the assertion to hold. Therefore, `invalid + unowned + exclusive + nonexclusive >= 1` is necessary.",
