The input to Frama-C is a C program file with ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) annotations.\nFor the given program, find the necessary loop invariants of the while loop to help Frama-C verify the post-condition.\n\nInstructions:\n- Make a note of the pre-conditions or variable assignments in the program.\n- Analyze the loop body and make a note of the loop condition. \n- Output loop invariants that are true \n(i) before the loop execution, \n(ii) in every iteration of the loop and \n(iii) after the loop termination, \nsuch that the loop invariants imply the post condition.\n- If a loop invariant is a conjunction, split it into its parts.\n- Output all the loop invariants in one code block. For example:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i1;\n    loop invariant i2;\n*/\n```\nRules:\n- **Do not use variables or functions that are not declared in the program.** \n- **Do not make any assumptions about functions whose definitions are not given.**\n- **All undefined variables contain garbage values. Do not use variables that have garbage values.**\n- **Do not use keywords that are not supported in ACSL annotations for loops.**\n- **Variables that are not explicitly initialized, could have garbage values.

This invariant states that `x` must be even at all times. Since `x` is incremented by `2` in each iteration, it will always be even.\n\nFinally, we add a conjunction that bounds the maximum value that `x` can take:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 10;\n    loop invariant !(x % 2) ==> x >= 10;\n    loop invariant x % 2 == 0;\n    loop invariant x <= UINT_MAX - 1;\n*/\n```\n\nThis invariant states that `x` must be less than or equal to the maximum value that an `unsigned int` can hold, which is `UINT_MAX - 1`. \n\nThese loop invariants imply the post condition `!(x % 2)` because if `x` is even and greater than or equal to `10`, then `!(x % 2)` must be true.
