            "We start by analyzing the program and making some notes:\n\n- Pre-conditions: None.\n\n- Variable assignments: `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` are assigned non-deterministic values using the function `unknown_uint()`. `d1`, `d2`, and `d3` are assigned the value 1. `c1` and `c2` are assigned non-deterministic boolean values using the function `unknown_bool()`.\n\n- Loop condition: `x1 > 0 && x2 > 0 && x3 > 0`.\n\n- Post-condition: `x1 == 0 || x2 == 0 || x3 == 0`.\n\nBased on the loop condition and the post-condition, we can see that the loop terminates when at least one of the variables `x1`, `x2`, or `x3` becomes 0. Therefore, we can use the disjunction of the negation of each variable being greater than 0 as a loop invariant:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant !(x1 > 0) || !(x2 > 0) || !(x3 > 0);\n*/\n```\n\nNow we need to verify that this loop invariant is true before the loop execution. Since we know that `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` are assigned non-deterministic values, we can use an implication to make the invariant trivially true at the beginning of the loop:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x1 <= \\max_uint && x2 <= \\max_uint && x3 <= \\max_uint;\n    loop invariant c1 == \\true || c1 == \\false;\n    loop invariant c2 == \\true || c2 == \\false;\n    loop invariant !(x1 > 0) || !(x2 > 0) || !(x3 > 0);\n    loop invariant (\\forall unsigned int i; i < \\at(x1, Pre) ==> x1 >= i);\n    loop invariant (\\forall unsigned int i; i < \\at(x2, Pre) ==> x2 >= i);\n    loop invariant (\\forall unsigned int i; i < \\at(x3, Pre) ==> x3 >= i);\n    loop invariant \\true ==> !(x1 > 0) || !(x2 > 0) || !(x3 > 0);\n*/\n```\n\nNext, we need to verify that this loop invariant holds in every iteration of the loop. The loop body modifies the values of `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `c1`, and `c2`, but it preserves the loop condition that `x1 > 0 && x2 > 0 && x3 > 0`. Therefore, we can use the same loop invariant as before:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x1 <= \\max_uint && x2 <= \\max_uint && x3 <= \\max_uint;\n    loop invariant c1 == \\true || c1 == \\false;\n    loop invariant c2 == \\true || c2 == \\false;\n    loop invariant !(x1 > 0) || !(x2 > 0) || !(x3 > 0);\n    loop invariant (\\forall unsigned int i; i < \\at(x1, Pre) ==> x1 >= i);\n    loop invariant (\\forall unsigned int i; i < \\at(x2, Pre) ==> x2 >= i);\n    loop invariant (\\forall unsigned int i; i < \\at(x3, Pre) ==> x3 >= i);\n    loop invariant \\true ==> !(x1 > 0) || !(x2 > 0) || !(x3 > 0);\n*/\n```\n\nFinally, we need to verify that the loop invariant implies the post-condition. Since the loop invariant states that the disjunction of the negation of each variable being greater than 0 always holds, it implies that at least one of the variables `x1`, `x2`, or `x3` becomes 0 at some point during the loop execution. Therefore, we can use an implication to take care of the conditional nature of the post-condition:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x1 <= \\max_uint && x2 <= \\max_uint && x3 <= \\max_uint;\n    loop invariant c1 == \\true || c1 == \\false;\n    loop invariant c2 == \\true || c2 == \\false;\n    loop invariant !(x1 > 0) || !(x2 > 0) || !(x3 > 0);\n    loop invariant (\\forall unsigned int i; i < \\at(x1, Pre) ==> x1 >= i);\n    loop invariant (\\forall unsigned int i; i < \\at(x2, Pre) ==> x2 >= i);\n    loop invariant (\\forall unsigned int i; i < \\at(x3, Pre",
