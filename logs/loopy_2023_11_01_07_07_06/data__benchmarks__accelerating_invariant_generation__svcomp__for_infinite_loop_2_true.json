The loop condition is `1`, which is always true.\n\n**Step 3: Loop invariants**\n- `i` is always non-negative. Thus, we can add the following loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant 0 <= i; */\n```\n- Since the loop is infinite, we cannot use `i` as a termination argument. \n\n- The loop body has an assertion `x==0`. This assertion always holds true since `x` is never updated inside the loop. Thus, we can add the following loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant x == 0; */\n```\n- The assertion `x!=0` is outside the loop and is guarded by the condition `1`. Thus, we can use the condition in an implication to include the assertion as a loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant (1 ==> x != 0); */\n```\n- Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, we can add the following loop invariant to bound the maximum value of `i`:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant i <= n; */\n```\nNote that this invariant holds because `n` is assumed to be greater than 0 and `i` starts from 0.\n\n- Since the loop is infinite, we cannot use `x` and `y` to imply the post-condition. Thus, we can use the condition `1` in an implication to include the post-condition as a loop invariant:\n```\n/*@ loop invariant (1 ==> x != 0); */\n```\n\nPutting all the loop invariants together, we get:\n```\n/*@ \n  loop invariant 0 <= i;\n  loop invariant x == 0;\n  loop invariant (1 ==> x != 0);\n  loop invariant i <= n;\n  loop invariant (1 ==> x != 0);\n*/\n```",

Let's start with the loop condition: `1`.\n\nSince the loop condition is always true, we need to find an invariant that ensures termination. We can use the loop variant `n-i` to ensure that the loop terminates after `n` iterations.\n\nNow let's consider the assertions inside and outside the loop:\n- `//@ assert(x==0);`\n- `//@ assert(x!=0);`\n\nSince the loop contains only an empty statement, we cannot modify the value of `x` inside the loop. Therefore, the invariant `x==0` is true before and during the loop execution. However, after the loop execution, we know that the loop executed `n` times and did not modify `x`. Therefore, we can use the implication `n>0 ==> x!=0` to ensure that `x` is not equal to 0 after the loop execution.\n\nPutting it all together, we get the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant 0 <= i <= n;\n    loop invariant x == 0;\n    loop variant n-i;\n*/\n```\nNote that we do not need any bounds on `x` or `y` since they are not modified inside the loop and their initial values are not constrained.",
