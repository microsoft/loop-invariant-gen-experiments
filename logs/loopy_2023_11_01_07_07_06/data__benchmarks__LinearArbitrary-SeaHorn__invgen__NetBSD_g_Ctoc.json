This invariant follows from the fact that `i` and `j` are incremented by the same amount in each iteration of the loop, and `len` is decremented by 1.\n- `j < BASE_SZ ==> i < BASE_SZ`: if `j` is less than `BASE_SZ`, then `i` must also be less than `BASE_SZ`. This invariant is necessary because `i` and `j` are incremented in each iteration of the loop, and we want to make sure that they do not exceed `BASE_SZ`.\n- `len == 0 ==> i == j`: if `len` is equal to `0`, then `i` must be equal to `j`.

This is needed to ensure that the loop terminates properly and the post-condition is satisfied. \n\nNote: Since `__BLAST_NONDET` is non-deterministic, we do not need to add any invariant for it as it can take any value and still satisfy the loop invariants and the post-condition.",
