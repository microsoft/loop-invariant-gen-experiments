            "First, let's look at the pre-conditions and variable assignments:\n- The macro `assume` takes a boolean expression as input. If the expression is false, the function returns 0. \n- The external function `unknown_uint` returns an unsigned integer.\n- The macro `a` is defined as 2.\n- The variable `n` is assigned the value returned by `unknown_uint`.\n- The variables `i` and `sn` are declared and `i` is assigned the value 1.\n\nNext, let's analyze the loop body and the loop condition:\n- The loop iterates from `i=1` to `n`.\n- In each iteration, the variable `sn` is updated by adding the value of `a` to it.\n- If `i` is equal to 4, `sn` is assigned the value -10.\n\nBased on the program, we can output the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@\n  loop invariant 1 <= i <= n+1;\n  loop invariant sn == (i-1)*a || sn == -10;\n*/\n```\nExplanation of loop invariants:\n- `1 <= i <= n+1`: The variable `i` is always greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n+1`. This is because `i` starts at 1 and increases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n+1`. \n- `sn == (i-1)*a || sn == -10`: This invariant holds for every iteration of the loop. When `i` is less than or equal to 4, `sn` is equal to `(i-1)*a` because it is updated by adding `a` in each iteration. When `i` is equal to 4, `sn` is assigned the value -10. After `i` becomes greater than 4, `sn` will always be equal to `(i-1)*a` because the conditional statement will never be true again. Therefore, at the end of the loop, `sn` will be equal to `(n+1-1)*a = n*a` or -10. \n\nNote: We do not need to bound the maximum and minimum values of `i`, `n`, or `sn` because they are all initialized to non-deterministic values.",
