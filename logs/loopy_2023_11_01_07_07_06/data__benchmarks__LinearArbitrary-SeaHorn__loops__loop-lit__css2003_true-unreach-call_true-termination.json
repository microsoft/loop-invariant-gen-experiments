This invariant is also true in every iteration of the loop because j is updated as j = j + k, which is equivalent to j = k * (i-1) + 1.\n- The third invariant is true before the loop execution because k is assigned a value using an external function and the condition !(0 <= k && k <= 1) returns 0 if k is not in the range [0,1]. This invariant is also true in every iteration of the loop because k is updated as k = k - 1, and the condition 0 <= k <= 1 ensures that k remains in the range [0,1].\n- The fourth invariant ensures that i + k <= 2 when the loop condition is true, i.e. before the loop body is executed. This is because the loop condition is i < LARGE_INT and LARGE_INT is defined as 1000000, which is much larger than 2. Hence, if i + k > 2, then i >= LARGE_INT, which contradicts the loop condition. If i + k <= LARGE_INT, then i + k <= 2 implies that i + k <= LARGE_INT. Hence, the fourth invariant is true before the loop body is executed and remains true in every iteration of the loop.\n- The fifth invariant ensures that i + k == LARGE_INT + 1 when the loop terminates. This is because the loop condition is i < LARGE_INT, and i is incremented by 1 in every iteration of the loop. Hence, when the loop terminates, i == LARGE_INT and k == 1, which implies that i + k == LARGE_INT + 1.\n- The sixth invariant ensures that 1 <= i + k <= 2 in every iteration of the loop, except for the last iteration when i == LARGE_INT. This is because i + k is updated as i + k = i + k - 1 + 1 = (i-1) + k + 1, which is equivalent to (i + k <= LARGE_INT) ==> (i + k <= 2). When i == LARGE_INT, the loop terminates and the fifth invariant applies. Hence, the sixth invariant is true in every iteration of the loop, except for the last iteration when i == LARGE_INT.",
