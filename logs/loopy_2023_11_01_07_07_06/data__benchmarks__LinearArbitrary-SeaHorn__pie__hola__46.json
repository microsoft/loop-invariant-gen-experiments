This is because `w` increases by 1 every time `x` increases by 1, so `w/2` is an upper bound on the number of times `x` can be incremented.\n- Similarly, `y` is incremented by 1 every time the condition `z%2 == 0` is true, so we can add the loop invariant `y <= z/2`.\n- Since `w` is always greater than or equal to 1, we can add the loop invariant `w >= 1`.\n- Since `z` is always greater than or equal to 0, we can add the loop invariant `z >= 0`.\n- Since `x` and `y` are initialized to 0 and are incremented only within the loop, we can add the loop invariants `x >= 0` and `y >= 0`.\n- Since `w` is incremented by 1 every time `x` is incremented by 1, we can add the loop invariant `w >= x`.\n- Similarly, since `z` is incremented by 1 every time `y` is incremented by 1, we can add the loop invariant `z >= y`.\n\nPutting all the loop invariants together, we get:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x <= w/2;\n    loop invariant y <= z/2;\n    loop invariant w >= 1;\n    loop invariant z >= 0;\n    loop invariant x >= 0;\n    loop invariant y >= 0;\n    loop invariant w >= x;\n    loop invariant z >= y;\n*/\n``` \nTo verify the assertion `x<=1` at the end of the program, we can use the guard condition of the assertion and add the implication `!(unknown2()) ==> (x <= 1)`.
