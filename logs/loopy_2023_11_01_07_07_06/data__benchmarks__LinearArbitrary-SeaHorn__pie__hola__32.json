Since the loop condition is `n < 2*k`, we know that `n` is always less than or equal to `2*k`. Therefore, `0 <= n <= 2*k` holds.\n- Inside the loop, `i` and `j` are updated based on the value of `b`. If `b` is 1, then `i` is incremented by 1 and `b` is set to 0. Otherwise, `j` is incremented by 1 and `b` is set to 1. Since `b` can only be 0 or 1, we have `b == 0 || b == 1`.\n- We also know that `i` and `j` start at 0 and are incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. Therefore, if `n/2 + 1` is greater than `k+1`, then `i` and `j` would exceed `k` in some iteration, which contradicts the post-condition. Hence, we have `0 <= i <= n/2 + 1 ==> 0 <= i <= k+1` and `0 <= j <= n/2 + 1 ==> 0 <= j <= k+1`.\n- After the loop, we know that `i` and `j` hold the same value since they are updated in the same way based on the value of `b`.

Therefore, the sum of `i` and `j` at any point is equal to the number of times the loop has executed so far.\n    - `(int)b = (n % 2)` because `b` alternates between 1 and 0 in every iteration of the loop.

Therefore, they must be equal.\n\nNote: Since `i` and `j` are assigned non-deterministic values, we cannot bound their maximum and minimum values.
