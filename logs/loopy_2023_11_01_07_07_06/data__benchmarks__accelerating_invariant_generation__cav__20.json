This is because (x+y) is being modified differently depending on whether j is equal to i or not inside the loop. \n- The eighth loop invariant states that if j is equal to i, then (x-y) should be equal to (k-2*y+2*x), and if j is not equal to i, then (x-y) should be equal to (2*y-2*x+k). This is inferred from the if-else condition inside the loop that modifies (x,y) differently depending on whether j is equal to i or not. \n- The ninth loop invariant states that if j is equal to i, then (x-y) should be greater than or equal to (k-2*n), and if j is not equal to i, then (x-y) should be greater than or equal to (-k). This is inferred from the if-else condition inside the loop that modifies (x,y) differently depending on whether j is equal to i or not. \n- The tenth loop invariant states that if j is equal to i, then (x-y) should be less than or equal to (2*n-k), and if j is not equal to i, then (x-y) should be less than or equal to k. This is inferred from the if-else condition inside the loop that modifies (x,y) differently depending on whether j is equal to i or not. \n- The eleventh loop invariant states that (x+y) should be equal to k after the loop terminates. This is inferred from the if condition that checks if (x+y) is equal to k, and the program returns if it is not. \n- The twelfth loop invariant states that if n is greater than or equal to 1, then j should be greater",
