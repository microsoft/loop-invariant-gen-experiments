In each iteration, `x` is updated as `x = x - y + y = x`. Therefore, `x` remains equal to the sum of all `y` values seen so far in the loop.\n    - `y != 0`: This is the same as the loop invariant before the loop execution.\n- After the loop termination:\n    - `x == 0`: We know that `x` is equal to the sum of all `y` values seen in the loop. Since the loop terminates after `n` iterations, `x` must be equal to the sum of all `y` values in the range `y_0` to `y_{n-1}`. Since we know that each `y` value is non-zero, the sum of all `y` values in this range must be `0`. Therefore, `x` must be `0` after the loop termination.\n\nWe can combine all of these loop invariants into a single block:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x == (\\sum_{j=0}^{i-1} y_j);\n    loop invariant y != 0;\n    loop invariant x == 0 ==> i >= n;\n    loop invariant i >= 0;\n    loop invariant n > 0;\n    loop assigns i, x, y;\n    loop variant n-i;\n*/\n``` \n\nNote that we have also added two additional loop invariants:\n- `x == 0 ==> i >= n`: This invariant says that if `x` is `0`, then we have already seen `n` iterations of the loop. This is because `x` can only be `0` if the sum of all `y` values in the loop is `0`, which can only happen if we have seen `n` non-zero `y` values.\n- `i >= 0`: This invariant simply says that `i` is always non-negative. This is implied by the loop condition `i < n`, which implies that `i` is always less than or equal to `n-1`, which in turn implies that `i` is always non-negative.",

This is because x is assigned the value of x-y and then x+y in each iteration. Hence, x is always the sum of all previous values of y.\n- The third loop invariant ensures that y is always non-zero.\n- The fourth loop invariant is derived from the previous two invariants. It ensures that at the end of each iteration, x is always equal to the sum of all values of y up to that point minus the sum of all previous values of y. This is because x is assigned the value of x-y and then x+y in each iteration.\n- The fifth loop invariant ensures that if x is equal to 0, then i must be equal to n. This is because the loop only terminates when i is equal to n, and the only way for x to be equal to 0 is if the sum of all values of y up to that point equals the sum of all previous values of y.

This is because the `x` value in the current iteration is the sum of `x` value in the previous iteration and the difference between `x` and `y` in the current iteration.\n    - `y != 0`: `y` is always non-zero.\n    - `y > 0 ==> x > 0`: If `y` is positive, then adding it to `x` increases `x`.\n    - `y < 0 ==> x < 0`: If `y` is negative, then adding it to `x` decreases `x`.\n- After the loop, `x` is 0, which is the required post-condition.",
