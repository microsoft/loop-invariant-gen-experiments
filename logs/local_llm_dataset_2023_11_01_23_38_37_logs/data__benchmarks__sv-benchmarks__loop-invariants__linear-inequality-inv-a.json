            "content": " The loop in question is the while loop that starts at line 10 and ends at line 16.\n\n1. Before the loop execution, the invariant is that `i == 0`, because the loop condition is `i < n`, and `n` is initialized to `unknown_uchar()`.\n2. In every iteration of the loop, the invariant is that `i < n`, because the loop condition is `i < n`, and `n` is initialized to `unknown_uchar()`.\n3. After the loop termination, the invariant is that `i == n`, because the loop terminates when `i >= n`, and `n` is initialized to `unknown_uchar()`.\n\nSo, the loop invariants for the while loop are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant i == 0;\n    loop invariant i < n;\n    loop invariant i == n;\n*/\n```\nNote that these invariants are necessary to ensure that the loop terminates, but they do not imply the post-condition of the program, which is that the sum of the values of `v` is less than or equal to 65025. To prove this post-condition, we need additional invariants that are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination."
