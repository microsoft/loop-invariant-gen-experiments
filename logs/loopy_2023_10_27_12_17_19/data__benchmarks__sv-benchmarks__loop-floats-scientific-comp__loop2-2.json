Since `term` is always positive and `multFactor` is either `1` or `-1`, `oddExp` and `evenExp` are always positive.\n- If `temp` is equal to 0, then the loop terminates.

This expression is simplified using the definition of `multFactor`.\n- `evenExp == \\sum(int i=0; i<=count/2; i++) pow(-1, i)*(pow(x, 2*i)/(2*i!))`: `evenExp` is the sum of the terms of the even-indexed terms in the series expansion of `cos(x)`, which is an alternating series. This expression uses the fact that the sum of an alternating series with terms decreasing in absolute value is bounded by the absolute value of the first neglected term.\n- `oddExp == \\sum(int i=0; i<(count-1)/2; i++) pow(-1, i)*(pow(x, 2*i+1)/((2*i+1)!))`: `oddExp` is the sum of the terms of the odd-indexed terms in the series expansion of `sin(x)`, which is an alternating series. This expression uses the fact that the sum of an alternating series with terms decreasing in absolute value is bounded by the absolute value of the first neglected term.\n- `x > octant ==> (oddExp >= evenExp)`: this is the assertion that we need to prove, but it is guarded by the condition `x > octant`.

This is a valid formula for the term in the Taylor series of `exp(x)`.\n- `evenExp` and `oddExp` are updated in each iteration using the formulae for the Taylor series of `cos(x)` and `sin(x)` respectively. These formulae are valid for all real values of `x`.\n- `multFactor` is updated in each iteration to alternate between 1 and -1, which is needed to compute the terms in the Taylor series of `cos(x)` and `sin(x)`.\n- `temp == 0 ==> oddExp >= evenExp` is an implication that ensures the assertion holds true whenever `unknown_int()` returns 0. This is because the loop runs indefinitely until `unknown_int()` returns 0, so the assertion should hold true after the loop terminates.\n- `x > 0 ==> term <= pow(x, count-2) / factorial(count-2)` is a conjunction that bounds the maximum value of `term` when `x` is positive. This is because the terms in the Taylor series of `exp(x)` decrease in magnitude as `x` increases.\n- `x < 0 ==> term >= pow(x, count-2) / factorial(count-2)` is a conjunction that bounds the minimum value of `term` when `x` is negative. This is because the terms in the Taylor series of `exp(x)` increase in magnitude as `x` decreases.\n- `evenExp >= 1` is a conjunction that ensures `evenExp` is always greater than or equal to 1, since the first term in the Taylor series of `cos(x)` is 1.\n- `oddExp <= x + pow(x, count-1) / factorial(count-1)` is a conjunction that bounds the maximum value of `oddExp` using the fact that the terms in the Taylor series of `sin(x)` decrease in magnitude as `x` increases.",

Therefore, if `count` is divisible by `4`, then `multFactor` is `1`, otherwise it is `-1`.\n- The value of `term` is multiplied by `x/count` twice in each iteration of the loop. Since `x` is positive and `count` is always positive and even, the value of `term` is always positive.\n- In each iteration of the loop, `evenExp` is updated by adding or subtracting `term` depending on the value of `multFactor`. Since `multFactor` is `1` for even values of `count` and `-1` for odd values of `count`, `evenExp` will alternate between overestimating and underestimating the true value of `cos(x)`.\n- Since `evenExp` starts from `1.0` and alternates between overestimating and underestimating the true value of `cos(x)`, it will always be less than or equal to `pi/2`.\n- The value of `oddExp` is updated in the same way as `evenExp`, but with an initial value of `x`. Therefore, it will always be greater than or equal to `x`.\n- The value of `term` is updated by multiplying it with `x/count` twice in each iteration of the loop. Therefore, its maximum value can be calculated by taking the maximum value of `x^2/count` over all values of `count` in the loop. Since `count` starts from `2` and is incremented by `2` in each iteration of the loop, the maximum value of `term` is `x^2/2` and the loop invariant can be expressed as `term <= x^2/count <= x^2/2`.\n- The assertion `oddExp >= evenExp` holds true if the loop is executed at least once and the value of `temp` is `0` when the loop terminates. Therefore, we can add an implication to the loop invariant to take into account the condition `temp == 0`. If `temp` is not `0`, then the assertion can be trivially true."

This is a valid formula for the term in the Taylor series of `exp(x)`.\n- `evenExp` and `oddExp` are updated in each iteration using the formulae for the Taylor series of `cos(x)` and `sin(x)` respectively. These formulae are valid for all real values of `x`.\n- `multFactor` is updated in each iteration to alternate between 1 and -1, which is needed to compute the terms in the Taylor series of `cos(x)` and `sin(x)`.\n- `temp == 0 ==> oddExp >= evenExp` is an implication that ensures the assertion holds true whenever `unknown_int()` returns 0. This is because the loop runs indefinitely until `unknown_int()` returns 0, so the assertion should hold true after the loop terminates.\n- `x > 0 ==> term <= pow(x, count-2) / factorial(count-2)` is a conjunction that bounds the maximum value of `term` when `x` is positive. This is because the terms in the Taylor series of `exp(x)` decrease in magnitude as `x` increases.\n- `x < 0 ==> term >= pow(x, count-2) / factorial(count-2)` is a conjunction that bounds the minimum value of `term` when `x` is negative. This is because the terms in the Taylor series of `exp(x)` increase in magnitude as `x` decreases.\n- `evenExp >= 1` is a conjunction that ensures `evenExp` is always greater than or equal to 1, since the first term in the Taylor series of `cos(x)` is 1.\n- `oddExp <= x + pow(x, count-1) / factorial(count-1)` is a conjunction that bounds the maximum value of `oddExp` using the fact that the terms in the Taylor series of `sin(x)` decrease in magnitude as `x` increases."

Therefore, if `count` is divisible by `4`, then `multFactor` is `1`, otherwise it is `-1`.\n- The value of `term` is multiplied by `x/count` twice in each iteration of the loop. Since `x` is positive and `count` is always positive and even, the value of `term` is always positive.\n- In each iteration of the loop, `evenExp` is updated by adding or subtracting `term` depending on the value of `multFactor`. Since `multFactor` is `1` for even values of `count` and `-1` for odd values of `count`, `evenExp` will alternate between overestimating and underestimating the true value of `cos(x)`.\n- Since `evenExp` starts from `1.0` and alternates between overestimating and underestimating the true value of `cos(x)`, it will always be less than or equal to `pi/2`.\n- The value of `oddExp` is updated in the same way as `evenExp`, but with an initial value of `x`. Therefore, it will always be greater than or equal to `x`.\n- The value of `term` is updated by multiplying it with `x/count` twice in each iteration of the loop. Therefore, its maximum value can be calculated by taking the maximum value of `x^2/count` over all values of `count` in the loop. Since `count` starts from `2` and is incremented by `2` in each iteration of the loop, the maximum value of `term` is `x^2/2` and the loop invariant can be expressed as `term <= x^2/count <= x^2/2`.\n- The assertion `oddExp >= evenExp` holds true if the loop is executed at least once and the value of `temp` is `0` when the loop terminates. Therefore, we can add an implication to the loop invariant to take into account the condition `temp == 0`. If `temp` is not `0`, then the assertion can be trivially true."
