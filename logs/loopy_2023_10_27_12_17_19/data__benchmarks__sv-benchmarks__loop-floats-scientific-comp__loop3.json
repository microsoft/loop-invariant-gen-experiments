Therefore, `count >= 2` is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n- `term` is assigned the value of `x` before the loop execution. In each iteration, `term` is multiplied by `(x/count)` twice.

This is true before the loop execution because `count` is initialized to `2` and `term` is assigned the value of `x`. In every iteration of the loop, `term` is updated to the product of `term` and `x/count` twice. Therefore, the invariant holds true in every iteration of the loop. After the loop termination, `term` is equal to the product of `x/(count-1)` and all numbers from `count-1` down to `2`, where `count` is the value of `count` in the last iteration of the loop.

In every iteration of the loop, `evenExp` and `oddExp` are updated based on the value of `multFactor` and `term`. Since `multFactor` is updated based on the value of `count`, which is even, `evenExp` is updated with the current value of `term`. Similarly, since `multFactor` is updated based on the value of `count`, which is odd, `oddExp` is updated with the current value of `term`. Therefore, the invariants hold true in every iteration of the loop. After the loop termination, `evenExp` is greater than or equal to `oddExp` as per the assertion.

This is true because `evenExp` is updated with the current value of `term` only when `count` is even and `oddExp` is updated with the current value of `term` only when `count` is odd. Since `count` is incremented by `2` in every iteration of the loop, the parity of `count` alternates between even and odd.

This is true before the loop execution because `count` is initialized to `2` and `term` is assigned the value of `x`. In every iteration of the loop, `term` is updated to the product of `term` and `x/count` twice. Therefore, the invariant holds true in every iteration of the loop. After the loop termination, `term` is equal to the product of `x/(count-1)` and all numbers from `count-1` down to `2`, where `count` is the value of `count` in the last iteration of the loop. Therefore, the invariant holds true after the loop termination.\n- The second invariant states that `oddExp` is always equal to the sum of `x` raised to the odd powers and `evenExp` is always equal to the sum of `x` raised to the even powers. This is true before the loop execution because `oddExp` is assigned the value of `x` and `evenExp` is assigned the value `1.0`. In every iteration of the loop, `evenExp` and `oddExp` are updated based on the value of `multFactor` and `term`. Since `multFactor` is updated based on the value of `count`, which is even, `evenExp` is updated with the current value of `term`. Similarly, since `multFactor` is updated based on the value of `count`, which is odd, `oddExp` is updated with the current value of `term`. Therefore, the invariants hold true in every iteration of the loop. After the loop termination, `evenExp` is greater than or equal to `oddExp` as per the assertion. Therefore, the invariants hold true after the loop termination.\n- The third invariant states that `evenExp >= oddExp` for every iteration of the loop. This is true because `evenExp` is updated with the current value of `term` only when `count` is even and `oddExp` is updated with the current value of `term` only when `count` is odd. Since `count` is incremented by `2` in every iteration of the loop, the parity of `count` alternates between even and odd. Therefore, the invariant holds true in every iteration of the loop.\n- The fourth invariant states that `multFactor` is equal to `1` if"

In each iteration, `term` is multiplied by `(x/count)` twice. `evenExp` and `oddExp` are updated using `term` in different ways depending on the parity of `count`. Therefore, `evenExp == 1 + (term * sigma i=1 to floor(count/2) : pow(-1,i+1) * pow(x,2*i) / fact(2*i))` and `oddExp == x + (term * sigma i=1 to floor((count-1)/2) : pow(-1,i+1) * pow(x,2*i+1) / fact(2*i+1))` are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n- `multFactor` depends on the parity of `count`. If `count` is even, then `multFactor` is `1`, otherwise it is `-1`. Therefore, `multFactor == pow(-1,floor(count/2))` is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n- If `count` is even, then `evenExp` is updated with `term`, otherwise `oddExp` is updated with `term`. Therefore, if `count%2 == 0`, then `evenExp >= oddExp`, and if `count%2 == 1`, then `evenExp <= oddExp`. Therefore, `count%2 == 0 ==> (evenExp >= oddExp)` and `count%2 == 1 ==> (evenExp <= oddExp)` are true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.\n- The assertion is guarded by `temp == 0`. Therefore, if `temp` is non-zero, then the assertion does not need to be true. Therefore, `temp == 0 ==> (evenExp >= oddExp)` is true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination.",

This is true before the loop execution because `count` is initialized to `2` and `term` is assigned the value of `x`. In every iteration of the loop, `term` is updated to the product of `term` and `x/count` twice. Therefore, the invariant holds true in every iteration of the loop. After the loop termination, `term` is equal to the product of `x/(count-1)` and all numbers from `count-1` down to `2`, where `count` is the value of `count` in the last iteration of the loop. Therefore, the invariant holds true after the loop termination.\n- The second invariant states that `oddExp` is always equal to the sum of `x` raised to the odd powers and `evenExp` is always equal to the sum of `x` raised to the even powers. This is true before the loop execution because `oddExp` is assigned the value of `x` and `evenExp` is assigned the value `1.0`. In every iteration of the loop, `evenExp` and `oddExp` are updated based on the value of `multFactor` and `term`. Since `multFactor` is updated based on the value of `count`, which is even, `evenExp` is updated with the current value of `term`. Similarly, since `multFactor` is updated based on the value of `count`, which is odd, `oddExp` is updated with the current value of `term`. Therefore, the invariants hold true in every iteration of the loop. After the loop termination, `evenExp` is greater than or equal to `oddExp` as per the assertion. Therefore, the invariants hold true after the loop termination.\n- The third invariant states that `evenExp >= oddExp` for every iteration of the loop. This is true because `evenExp` is updated with the current value of `term` only when `count` is even and `oddExp` is updated with the current value of `term` only when `count` is odd. Since `count` is incremented by `2` in every iteration of the loop, the parity of `count` alternates between even and odd. Therefore, the invariant holds true in every iteration of the loop.\n- The fourth invariant states that `multFactor` is equal to `1` if",

We want to verify that `evenExp` is greater than or equal to `oddExp` when the loop terminates. Therefore, this needs to be an invariant of the loop.\n- `count > 1`: This is true before the loop starts because `count` is assigned the value of 2 before the loop.

It is also true after the loop terminates because the loop runs infinitely and `count` keeps getting incremented by 2.\n- `term >= 0`: This is true before the loop starts because `term` is assigned the value of `x` before the loop.

It is also true after the loop terminates because the loop runs infinitely and `term` keeps getting multiplied by a positive number.\n- `multFactor == 1 || multFactor == -1`: This is true in every iteration of the loop because `multFactor` is assigned either 1 or -1 in each iteration.\n- `temp == 0 ==> evenExp >= oddExp`: This means that if `temp` is equal to 0, then the post-condition of the program is satisfied.

This is true in every iteration of the loop because `x` is assigned the value of `unknown_float()` before the loop and we do not know anything about the value of `x`.\n- `octant2 > octant1 ==> evenExp >= oddExp`: This means that if `octant2` is greater than `octant1`, then the post-condition of the program is satisfied.

Hence, `count` is always even and greater than or equal to `2`.\n- `multFactor` is `1` when `count/2` is even, and `-1` when `count/2` is odd. Hence, `multFactor` is always either `1` or `-1`.\n- `evenExp` starts from `1` and is incremented by `multFactor*term` in even iterations. Hence, `evenExp` is always greater than or equal to `1`.\n- `oddExp` starts from `x` and is incremented by `multFactor*term` in odd iterations. Hence, `oddExp` is always greater than or equal to `x`.\n- Since `evenExp` is incremented by a positive or zero value in even iterations, and `oddExp` is incremented by a negative or zero value in odd iterations, it follows that `oddExp` is always less than or equal to `evenExp`.\n\nSince the loop runs infinitely, we cannot say anything about the final values of `evenExp` and `oddExp`. However, we can add an implication for the assertion, using the guard condition `temp == 0`:\n- `temp != 0 ==> evenExp >= oddExp`\n\nFinally, since the values of `x`, `octant1`, and `octant2` are not known, we cannot add any bounds on them.",
