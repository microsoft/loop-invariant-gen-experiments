This is the same as the loop invariants.\n- In every iteration of the loop, `0 <= i <= n` ensures that the loop does not run indefinitely. The loop invariant `0 <= s <= i * 255` bounds the value of `s` to a maximum of `i * 255`. This is because the maximum value that can be stored in an unsigned char is 255. Therefore, the maximum value that can be stored in `v` is 255, and the maximum value of `s` would be `n * 255`. Since the loop adds at most `v` to `s`, the maximum value of `s` at any iteration would be `i * 255`.\n- After the loop termination, `0 <= i <= n` ensures that the loop has terminated with a valid value of `i`. The loop invariant `s <= n * 255` bounds the value of `s` to a maximum of `n * 255`. This is because the loop adds at most `v` to `s`, and the maximum value of `v` is 255. Therefore, the maximum value of `s` after the loop termination would be `n * 255`.\n- Since the assertion is not guarded by any condition, we do not need to use implication. \n- The variables `v` and `n` are non-deterministic at the beginning of the loop, but we do not need to use implication since the loop invariant `0 <= s <= i * 255` is trivially true when `i = 0`.\n- Variable `v` is non-deterministic at the end of the loop, but we do not need to use implication since the loop invariant `0 <= s <= i * 255` is trivially true when `i = n`.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the given program are:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant s >= 0 && s <= i * 255;\n    loop invariant i >= 0 && i <= n;\n    loop invariant s <= n * 255;\n*/\n```",

If i is equal to 0, then s must also be equal to 0.\n\nImplications:\n- The post-condition assertion is guarded by two conditions. We can add implications for each of these conditions.

The second implication ensures that the assertion fails if the condition is met.\n\n- Similarly, for the second condition:\n```\n    if (s > 65025) {\n        //@ assert (s > 65025) ==> \\false;\n        {; \n        //@ assert(\\false);\n        };\n        return 1;\n    }\n```"

The post-condition checks that `s` is greater than or equal to `v` and less than or equal to `65025`. We can use implication to show that the loop invariants imply the post-condition:\n\n- `s < v ==> \\false` (if `s` is less than `v`, the program returns 1, which contradicts the post-condition)\n- `s > 65025 ==> \\false` (if `s` is greater than 65025, the program returns 1, which contradicts the post-condition)\n- `0 <= s && s <= 65025 && 0 <= i && i == n ==> 0 <= s && s <= 65025` (if `i` is equal to `n` and `s` is between 0 and 65025, the program returns 0, which satisfies the post-condition)\n\nTherefore, the loop invariants above imply the post-condition of the program.",
