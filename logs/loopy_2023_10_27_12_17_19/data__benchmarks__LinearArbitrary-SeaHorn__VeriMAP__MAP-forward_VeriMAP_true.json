Therefore, `0 <= i <= n`. \n- The values of `a` and `b` are updated in the loop body. We know that if `unknown_int()` is true, then `a` increases by `1` and `b` increases by `2`. Otherwise, `a` increases by `2` and `b` increases by `1`. Since `unknown_int()` is non-deterministic, we cannot make any assumptions about the values of `a` and `b`. However, we can say that `0 <= a <= 2*i` and `0 <= b <= 2*i`, since `a` and `b` can increase by at most `2` in each iteration of the loop.\n- The loop invariant `a+b == 3*i + 2*(a-b)` is derived from the conditional statements in the loop body. If `unknown_int()` is true, then we add `1` to `a` and `2` to `b`. Therefore, `a+b` increases by `3`. Otherwise, we add `2` to `a` and `1` to `b`. Therefore, `a+b` increases by `3`. Thus, `a+b` increases by `3` in every iteration of the loop, while `3*i + 2*(a-b)` remains constant.

This can be proven by splitting the loop into two cases: when the condition `unknown_int()` is true and when it is false. In the first case, `a` is incremented by 1 and `b` is incremented by 2, so the sum increases by 3. In the second case, `a` is incremented by 2 and `b` is incremented by 1, so the sum still increases by 3. Therefore, the sum is always equal to `3*i + 2*(n-i)`.\n- The fifth and sixth invariants state the relationship between `i`, `a`, and `b`. If `i` is even, then `a` should be equal to `i/2` and `b` should be equal to `(i+1)/2`. If `i` is odd, then `a` should be equal to `(i+1)/2` and `b` should be equal to `i/2`. These can be proven by induction on `i`. The base case is true, since when `i = 0`, both `a` and `b` are 0. For the induction step, assume the invariants hold for some `i`. If `i` is even, then in the next iteration `a` should be incremented by 1 and `b` should be incremented by 2, so the new values of `a` and `b` are `(i/2)+1` and `(i+1)/2+2`, respectively. This satisfies the invariants for `i+1`. If `i` is odd, then in the next iteration `a` should be incremented by 2 and `b` should be incremented by 1, so the new values of `a` and `b` are `(i+1)/2+2` and `i/2+1`, respectively. This also satisfies the invariants for `i+1`.\n- The seventh and eighth invariants state the relationship between `i`, `a`, `b`, and `n`. If `i` is even, then `b` should be equal to `n-a`. If `i` is odd, then `a` should be equal to `n-b`. These can be proven using the fifth and sixth invariants, along with the fact that `a+b = 3*i + 2*(n-i)`. If `i` is even, then `a = i/2` and `b = (i+1)/2`, so `a+b = i+1`. Solving the equations `a+b = i+1` and `a+n-b = 2*n-3*i-1`, we get `b = n-a`.

Thus, `a+b` is always equal to 3 times the number of iterations so far, which is `i`. Also, `a` and `b` are always non-negative, so `a >= 0` and `b >= 0`. Finally, since `a+b` is always equal to 3 times the number of iterations so far, it cannot exceed `3*n`, so `a+b <= 3*n`.\n- After the loop termination, `a+b` is equal to `3*n` because the loop has executed `n` times, and in each iteration, `a+b` was incremented by 3.

These can be proven by induction on `i`. The base case is true, since when `i = 0`, both `a` and `b` are 0. For the induction step, assume the invariants hold for some `i`. If `i` is even, then in the next iteration `a` should be incremented by 1 and `b` should be incremented by 2, so the new values of `a` and `b` are `(i/2)+1` and `(i+1)/2+2`, respectively.

However, we can use implication to make the loop invariants hold even if the values of `unknown_int()` are not known. For example, the loop invariant `(i < n) ==> ((a+b) = 3*i)` is always true, regardless of the value of `unknown_int()`, because the implication is vacuously true when `i >= n`. Similarly, the loop invariant `a+b <= 3*n` is always true, regardless of the value of `unknown_int()`, because it is an upper bound on the sum `a+b`."

In the second case, `a` is incremented by 2 and `b` is incremented by 1, so the sum still increases by 3. Therefore, the sum is always equal to `3*i + 2*(n-i)`.\n- The fifth and sixth invariants state the relationship between `i`, `a`, and `b`.

These can be proven by induction on `i`. The base case is true, since when `i = 0`, both `a` and `b` are 0. For the induction step, assume the invariants hold for some `i`. If `i` is even, then in the next iteration `a` should be incremented by 1 and `b` should be incremented by 2, so the new values of `a` and `b` are `(i/2)+1` and `(i+1)/2+2`, respectively. This satisfies the invariants for `i+1`. If `i` is odd, then in the next iteration `a` should be incremented by 2 and `b` should be incremented by 1, so the new values of `a` and `b` are `(i+1)/2+2` and `i/2+1`, respectively. This also satisfies the invariants for `i+1`.\n- The seventh and eighth invariants state the relationship between `i`, `a`, `b`, and `n`. If `i` is even, then `b` should be equal to `n-a`. If `i` is odd, then `a` should be equal to `n-b`. These can be proven using the fifth and sixth invariants, along with the fact that `a+b = 3*i + 2*(n-i)`. If `i` is even, then `a = i/2` and `b = (i+1)/2`, so `a+b = i+1`. Solving the equations `a+b = i+1` and `a+n-b = 2*n-3*i-1`, we get `b = n-a`.

Thus, `a+b` is always equal to 3 times the number of iterations so far, which is `i`. Also, `a` and `b` are always non-negative, so `a >= 0` and `b >= 0`. Finally, since `a+b` is always equal to 3 times the number of iterations so far, it cannot exceed `3*n`, so `a+b <= 3*n`.\n- After the loop termination, `a+b` is equal to `3*n` because the loop has executed `n` times, and in each iteration, `a+b` was incremented by 3. Therefore, the sum of all increments is `3*n`.\n\nNote: Since `unknown_int()` is a non-deterministic function call, we cannot make any assumptions about its return value.

For example, the loop invariant `(i < n) ==> ((a+b) = 3*i)` is always true, regardless of the value of `unknown_int()`, because the implication is vacuously true when `i >= n`. Similarly, the loop invariant `a+b <= 3*n` is always true, regardless of the value of `unknown_int()`, because it is an upper bound on the sum `a+b`.",

This is derived by observing that `a` is incremented by 1 in one branch and by 2 in the other, while `b` is incremented by 2 in one branch and by 1 in the other, in each iteration. Also, `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, `a` is always twice `i` when `i` is even, and `b` is always twice `i` when `i` is odd.)\n\nExplanation:\n- The first invariant states that `i` is always between 0 and `n`.\n- The second invariant states that `a` is always between 0 and `2n`. This is because `a` is incremented by either 1 or 2 in each iteration, and it starts with the value 0.\n- The third invariant states that `b` is always between 0 and `2n`. This is because `b` is incremented by either 1 or 2 in each iteration, and it starts with the value 0.\n- The fourth invariant states that the sum of `a` and `b` is always 3 times `i`, and this implies that it is equal to 3 times `n` at the end of the loop. This is because the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, and `a` and `b` are incremented in such a way that their sum is always 3 times `i`.\n- The fifth invariant combines the two if-else cases and states the relation between `a`, `b`, and `i`. This is derived by observing that `a` is incremented by 1 in one branch and by 2 in the other, while `b` is incremented by 2 in one branch and by 1 in the other, in each iteration. Also, `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, `a` is always twice `i` when `i` is even, and `b` is always twice `i` when `i` is odd. This invariant is necessary to take care of the conditional nature of the code.\n\nThe loop invariants hold true before the loop execution, in every iteration of the loop, and after the loop termination. These loop invariants imply the post-condition of the program, which is that `a+b` is equal to `3n`.",
