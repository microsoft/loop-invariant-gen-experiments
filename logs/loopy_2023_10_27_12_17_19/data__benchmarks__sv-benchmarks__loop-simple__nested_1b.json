Since we know that the loop condition is `a < 6`, we can use this as a loop invariant to show that `a` will always be less than `6` in every iteration of the loop.

We can use the loop invariant above to show that `a` will always be less than `6` in every iteration of the loop, which means that `a` cannot be equal to `6` before or after the loop. Therefore, the post-condition will always be true, and we can use the following loop invariants:\n\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant a != 6;\n*/\n```\n\nFinally, since there are no statements in the loop body, we don't need to consider any other loop invariants.
