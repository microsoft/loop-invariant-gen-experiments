            "First, let's analyze the loop body. The loop body contains two conditional statements. The first conditional statement assigns values to x and y if a condition is true. The second conditional statement assigns values to x and y if another condition is true and x is greater than or equal to 4.\n\nNow, let's analyze the program and find some pre-conditions. We have two integer variables x and y that are initialized to 0. We also have a macro `assume` that takes a boolean expression and returns 0 if the expression is false.\n\nNext, let's analyze the loop condition. The loop condition is `while (unknown_int())`. This means that the loop will execute as long as the function `unknown_int()` returns a non-zero value.\n\nBased on the program analysis, we can come up with the following loop invariants:\n```\n/*@ \n    loop invariant x >= 0 && y >= 0;\n    loop invariant x <= 3 * y / 4;\n    loop invariant (x >= 4 ==> y >= 6) ==> (3 * x < y ==> \\false);\n*/\n```\nThe first loop invariant ensures that both x and y are non-negative throughout the loop execution. \n\nThe second loop invariant ensures that the relationship between x and y is such that 3 times x is less than or equal to 4 times y. We can derive this relationship from the post-condition, which states that 3 times x is less than y. Since y is always positive, we can divide both sides of the inequality by 4 to get the relationship between x and y.\n\nThe third loop invariant takes care of the conditional nature of the code. If x is greater than or equal to 4 and y is less than 6, then the assertion `3*x < y` cannot hold. Therefore, we add this implication to ensure that the assertion is true if the condition inside the implication is true. \n\nSince there are no non-deterministic variables at the beginning or end of the loop, we don't need to use any implications to make the invariants trivially true.",

In this case, `x` is incremented by 1 and `y` is incremented by 2.\n\nThe second condition `(x >= 4 ==> y >= 2*x+3)` holds when `x` is greater than or equal to 4, which means that the second branch of the if statement is executed. In this case, `x` is incremented by 1 and `y` is incremented by 3.\n\nThe third condition `(x >= 0 ==> y >= 0)` holds for all values of `x` and `y` because both variables are initialized to 0 at the beginning of the program and are only incremented by non-negative values in the loop body.\n\nFinally, the loop invariant `3*x >= y` is derived by analyzing the post-condition and using the guard condition in an implication. Since the assertion is guarded by the condition `3*x < y`, we can use the implication `!(3*x < y) ==> 3*x >= y` to obtain the loop invariant."
